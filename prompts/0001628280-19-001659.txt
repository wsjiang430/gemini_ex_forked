Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We began operations in 1997 and, based on the number of facilities, are one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals (previously referred to as long term acute care hospitals), rehabilitation hospitals (previously referred to as inpatient rehabilitation facilities), outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we had operations in 47 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 96 critical illness recovery hospitals in 27 states, 26 rehabilitation hospitals in 11 states, and 1,662 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 37 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2018, Concentra, a joint venture subsidiary, operated 524 occupational health centers in 41 states. Concentra also provides contract services at employer worksites and Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinics (“CBOCs”).
We manage our Company through four business segments: our critical illness recovery hospital segment, our rehabilitation hospital segment, our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and our Concentra segment. We had net operating revenues of $5,081.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Of this total, we earned approximately 34% of our net operating revenues from our critical illness recovery hospital segment, approximately 14% from our rehabilitation hospital segment, approximately 21% from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and approximately 31% from our Concentra segment. Our critical illness recovery hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of patients recovering from critical illnesses, often with complex medical needs, and our rehabilitation hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive physical rehabilitation care. Patients are typically admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals from general acute care hospitals. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics that provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation services. Our Concentra segment consists of occupational health centers and contract services provided at employer worksites that deliver occupational medicine, physical therapy, and consumer health services. Additionally, our Concentra segment delivers veteran’s healthcare through its Department of Veterans Affairs CBOCs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 11. Segment Information” beginning on F-35 for financial information for each of our segments for the past three fiscal years, which have been recast to reflect the current reportable segment structure of our Company.
Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals
We are a leading operator of critical illness recovery hospitals in the United States, which are certified by Medicare as long term care hospitals (“LTCHs”). As of December 31, 2018, we operated 96 critical illness recovery hospitals in 27 states. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, approximately 53%, 52% and 51%, respectively, of the net operating revenues of our critical illness recovery hospital segment came from Medicare reimbursement. This percentage declined in 2018 as compared to the prior year because of the changes we implemented at critical illness recovery hospitals operating under Medicare patient criteria as LTCHs, which have resulted in lower Medicare patient volume. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 13,500 people in our critical illness recovery hospital segment, consisting primarily of registered nurses, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists.
We operate the majority of our critical illness recovery hospitals as a hospital within a hospital (an “HIH”). A critical illness recovery hospital that operates as an HIH leases space from a general acute care hospital, or “host hospital,” and operates as a separately licensed hospital within the host hospital, or on the same campus as the host hospital. In contrast, a free-standing critical illness recovery hospital does not operate on a host hospital campus. We owned 96 critical illness recovery hospitals at December 31, 2018, of which 71 were operated as HIHs and 25 were operated as free-standing hospitals.
Patients are typically admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals from general acute care hospitals, likely following an intensive care unit stay, suffering from chronic critical illness. These patients have highly specialized needs, with serious and complex medical conditions involving multiple organ systems. These conditions are often a result of complications related to heart failure, complex infectious disease, respiratory failure and pulmonary disease, complex surgery requiring prolonged recovery, renal disease, neurological events, and trauma. Given their complex medical needs, these patients require a longer length of stay than patients in a general acute care hospital and benefit from being treated in a critical illness recovery hospital that is designed to meet their unique medical needs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average length of stay for patients in our critical illness recovery hospitals was 28 days.

Additionally, we continually seek to increase our admissions by demonstrating our quality outcomes and, by doing so, expanding and improving our relationships with the physicians and general acute care hospitals in the markets where we operate. We maintain a strong focus on the provision of high-quality medical care within our facilities. The Joint Commission (“TJC”) and DNV GL Healthcare USA, Inc. (“DNV”) are independent, not-for-profit organizations that establish standards related to the operation and management of healthcare facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 96 critical illness recovery hospitals, 95 of which were accredited by TJC. One of our critical illness recovery hospitals was accredited by DNV.  Also as of December 31, 2018, all of our critical illness recovery hospitals were certified as LTCHs. Each of our critical illness recovery hospitals must regularly demonstrate to a survey team conformance to the applicable standards established by TJC, DNV or the Medicare program, as applicable.
When a patient is referred to one of our critical illness recovery hospitals by a physician, case manager, discharge planner, or payor, a clinical assessment is performed to determine patient eligibility for admission. Based on the determinations reached in this clinical assessment, an admission decision is made.
Upon admission, an interdisciplinary team meets to perform a comprehensive review of the patient’s condition. The interdisciplinary team is composed of a number of clinicians and may include any or all of the following: an attending physician; a registered nurse; a physical, occupational, and speech therapist; a respiratory therapist; a dietitian; a pharmacist; and a case manager. Upon completion of an initial evaluation by each member of the treatment team, an individualized treatment plan is established and immediately initiated. Case management coordinates all aspects of the patient’s hospital stay and serves as a liaison to the insurance carrier’s case management staff as appropriate. The case manager specifically communicates clinical progress, resource utilization, and treatment goals to the patient, the treatment team, and the payor.
Each of our critical illness recovery hospitals has a distinct medical staff that is composed of physicians from multiple specialties that have successfully completed the required privileging and credentialing process. In general, physicians on the medical staff are not directly employed but are more commonly independent, practicing at multiple hospitals in the community. Attending physicians conduct daily rounds on their patients while consulting physicians provide consulting services based on the specific medical needs of our patients. Each critical illness recovery hospital develops on-call arrangements with individual physicians to ensure that a physician is available to care for our patients. When determining the appropriate composition of the medical staff of a critical illness recovery hospital, we consider the size of the critical illness recovery hospital, services provided by the critical illness recovery hospital, if applicable, the size and capabilities of the medical staff of the general acute care hospital that hosts that HIH and, if applicable, the proximity of an acute care hospital to the free-standing critical illness recovery hospital. The medical staff of each of our critical illness recovery hospitals meets the applicable requirements set forth by Medicare, the hospital’s applicable accrediting organizations, and the state in which that critical illness recovery hospital is located.
Our critical illness recovery hospital segment is led by a president & chief operating officer, chief medical officer, and chief quality officer. Each of our critical illness recovery hospitals has an onsite management team consisting of a chief executive officer, a medical director, a chief nursing officer, and a director of business development. These teams manage local strategy and day-to-day operations, including oversight of clinical care and treatment. They also assume primary responsibility for developing relationships with the general acute care providers and clinicians in the local areas we serve that refer patients to our critical illness recovery hospitals. We provide our critical illness recovery hospitals with centralized accounting, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, management information systems, and billing and collection services. The centralization of these services improves efficiency and permits staff at our critical illness recovery hospitals to focus their time on patient care.
For a description of government regulations and Medicare payments made to our critical illness recovery hospitals, see “—Government Regulations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Strategy
The key elements of our critical illness recovery hospital strategy are to:
Focus on Specialized Inpatient Services. We serve highly acute patients and patients with debilitating injuries and rehabilitation needs that cannot be adequately cared for in a less medically intensive environment, such as a skilled nursing facility. Chronically critically ill patients admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals require long stays, benefiting from a more specialized and targeted clinical approach. Our care model is distinct from what patients experience in general acute care hospitals.
4

Provide High-Quality Care and Service. Our critical illness recovery hospitals serve a critical role in comprehensive healthcare delivery. Through our specialized treatment programs and staffing models, we treat patients with acute, highly complex, and specialized medical needs. Our treatment programs focus on specific patient needs and medical conditions, such as ventilator weaning protocols, comprehensive wound care assessments and treatment protocols, medication review and antibiotic stewardship, infection control prevention, and customized mobility, speech, and swallow programs. Our staffing models ensure that patients have the appropriate clinical resources over the course of their stay. We maintain quality assurance programs to support and monitor quality of care standards and to meet regulatory requirements and maintain Medicare certifications. We believe that we are recognized for providing quality care and service, which helps develop brand loyalty in the local areas we serve.
Our treatment programs are continuously reassessed and updated based on peer-reviewed literature. This approach provides our clinicians access to the best practices and protocols that we have found to be effective in treating various conditions in this population such as respiratory failure, non-healing wounds, brain injury, renal dysfunction, and complex infectious diseases. In addition, we customize these programs to provide a treatment plan tailored to meet our patients’ unique needs. The collaborative team-based approach coupled with the intense focus on patient safety and quality affords these highly complex patients the best opportunity to recover from catastrophic illness. This comprehensive care model is ultimately measured by the functional recovery of each of our patients.
The quality of the patient care we provide is continually monitored using several measures, including clinical outcomes data and analyses and patient satisfaction surveys. Quality metrics from our critical illness recovery hospitals are used to create monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting for our leadership team. In order to benchmark ourselves against other hospitals, we collect our clinical and patient satisfaction information and compare it to national standards and the results of other healthcare organizations. We are required to report quality measures to individual states based on unique requirements and laws. We also submit required quality data elements to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). See “—Government Regulations—Other Medicare Regulations—Medicare Quality Reporting.”
Control Operating Costs. We continually seek to improve operating efficiency and control costs at our critical illness recovery hospitals by standardizing operations and centralizing key administrative functions. These initiatives include:

• | centralizing administrative functions such as accounting, finance, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, and billing and collection;


• | standardizing management information systems to assist in capturing the medical record, accounting, billing, collections, and data capture and analysis; and


• | centralizing sourcing and contracting to receive discounted prices for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and other commodities used in our operations.

Increase Commercial Volume. We have focused on continued expansion of our relationships with commercial insurers to increase our volume of patients with commercial insurance in our critical illness recovery hospitals. We believe that commercial payors seek to contract with our hospitals because we offer our patients high-quality, cost-effective care at more attractive rates than general acute care hospitals. We also offer commercial enrollees customized treatment programs not typically offered in general acute care hospitals.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network of critical illness recovery hospitals through opportunistic acquisitions. When we acquire a critical illness recovery hospital or a group of related facilities, a team of our professionals is responsible for formulating and executing an integration plan. We seek to improve financial performance at such facilities by adding clinical programs that attract commercial payors, centralizing administrative functions, and implementing our standardized resource management programs.
Rehabilitation Hospitals
Our rehabilitation hospitals provide comprehensive physical medicine, as well as rehabilitation programs and services, which serve to optimize patient health, function, and quality of life in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 26 rehabilitation hospitals in 11 states. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, approximately 38%, 42% and 42%, respectively, of the net operating revenues of our rehabilitation hospital segment came from Medicare reimbursement. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 10,100 people in our rehabilitation hospital segment, consisting primarily of registered nurses, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, neuropsychologists, and other psychologists.

Patients at our rehabilitation hospitals have specialized needs, with serious and often complex medical conditions requiring rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting. These conditions require targeted therapy and rehabilitation treatment, including comprehensive rehabilitative services for brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes, amputations, neurological disorders, orthopedic conditions, pediatric congenital or acquired disabilities, and cancer. Given their complex medical needs and gradual and prolonged recovery, these patients generally require a longer length of stay than patients in a general acute care hospital. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average length of stay for patients in our rehabilitation hospitals was 14 days.
Additionally, we continually seek to increase our admissions by demonstrating our quality outcomes and, by doing so, expanding and improving our relationships with the physicians and general acute care hospitals in the markets where we operate. We maintain a strong focus on the provision of high-quality medical care within our facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 26 rehabilitation hospitals, 25 of which were accredited by TJC. One of our rehabilitation hospitals was accredited by DNV.  Also as of December 31, 2018, all of our rehabilitation hospitals were certified as Medicare providers as inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”). 12 of our rehabilitation hospitals also received accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”), an independent, not-for-profit organization that establishes standards related to the operation of medical rehabilitation facilities. Each of our rehabilitation hospitals must regularly demonstrate to a survey team conformance to the applicable standards established by TJC, DNV, the Medicare program, or CARF, as applicable.
When a patient is referred to one of our rehabilitation hospitals by a physician, case manager, discharge planner, health maintenance organization, or insurance company, we perform a clinical assessment of the patient to determine if the patient meets criteria for admission. Based on the determinations reached in this clinical assessment, an admission decision is made.
Upon admission, an interdisciplinary team reviews a new patient’s condition. The interdisciplinary team is composed of a number of clinicians and may include any or all of the following: an attending physician; a registered nurse; a physical, occupational, and speech therapist; a respiratory therapist; a dietitian; a pharmacist; and a case manager. Upon completion of an initial evaluation by each member of the treatment team, an individualized treatment plan is established and implemented. The case manager coordinates all aspects of the patient’s hospital stay and serves as a liaison with the insurance carrier’s case management staff when appropriate. The case manager communicates progress, resource utilization, and treatment goals between the patient, the treatment team, and the payor.
Each of our rehabilitation hospitals has a multi-specialty medical staff that is composed of physicians who have completed the privileging and credentialing process required by that rehabilitation hospital and have been approved by the governing board of that rehabilitation hospital. Physicians on the medical staff of our rehabilitation hospitals are generally not directly employed by our rehabilitation hospitals, but instead have staff privileges at one or more hospitals. At each of our rehabilitation hospitals, attending physicians conduct rounds on their patients on a regular basis and consulting physicians provide consulting services based on the medical needs of our patients. Our rehabilitation hospitals also have on-call arrangements with physicians to ensure that a physician is available to care for our patients. We staff our rehabilitation hospitals with the number of physicians, therapists, and other medical practitioners that we believe is appropriate to address the varying needs of our patients. When determining the appropriate composition of the medical staff of a rehabilitation hospital, we consider the size of the rehabilitation hospital, services provided by the rehabilitation hospital, and, if applicable, the proximity of an acute care hospital to the free-standing rehabilitation hospital. The medical staff of each of our rehabilitation hospitals meets the applicable requirements set forth by Medicare, the facility’s applicable accrediting organizations, and the state in which that rehabilitation hospital is located.
Our rehabilitation hospital segment is led by a president, chief operating officer, national medical director, chief academic officer, and chief quality officer. Each of our rehabilitation hospitals has an onsite management team consisting of a chief executive officer, a medical director, a chief nursing officer, a director of therapy services, and a director of business development. These teams manage local strategy and day-to-day operations, including oversight of clinical care and treatment. They also assume primary responsibility for developing relationships with the general acute care providers and clinicians in the local areas we serve that refer patients to our rehabilitation hospitals. We provide our facilities within our rehabilitation hospital segment with centralized accounting, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, management information systems, and billing and collection services. The centralization of these services improves efficiency and permits the staff at our rehabilitation hospitals to focus their time on patient care.
For a description of government regulations and Medicare payments made to our rehabilitation hospitals, see “—Government Regulations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Rehabilitation Hospital Strategy
The key elements of our rehabilitation hospital strategy are to:
Focus on Specialized Inpatient Services. We serve patients with debilitating injuries and rehabilitation needs that cannot be adequately cared for in a less medically intensive environment, such as a skilled nursing facility. Generally, patients in our rehabilitation hospitals require longer stays and can benefit from more specialized and intensive clinical care than patients treated in general acute care hospitals and require more intensive therapy than that provided in outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. Our rehabilitation hospitals serve a critical role in comprehensive healthcare delivery. Through our specialized treatment programs and staffing models, we treat patients with complex and specialized medical needs. Our specialized treatment programs focus on specific patient needs and medical conditions, such as rehabilitation programs for brain trauma and spinal cord injuries. We also focus on specific programs of care designed to restore strength, improve physical and cognitive function, and promote independence in activities of daily living for patients who have suffered complications from strokes, amputations, cancer, and neurological and orthopedic conditions. Our staffing models ensure that patients have the appropriate clinical resources over the course of their stay. We maintain quality assurance programs to support and monitor quality of care standards and to meet regulatory requirements and maintain Medicare certifications. We believe that we are recognized for providing quality care and service, which helps develop brand loyalty in the local areas we serve.
Our treatment programs, which are continuously reassessed and updated, benefit patients because they give our clinicians access to the best practices and protocols that we have found to be most effective in treating various conditions such as brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes, and neuromuscular disorders. In addition, we combine or modify these programs to provide a treatment plan tailored to meet our patients’ unique needs. We measure the outcomes and successes of our patients’ recovery in order to provide the best possible patient care and service.
The quality of the patient care we provide is continually monitored using several measures, including clinical outcomes data and analyses and patient satisfaction surveys. Quality metrics from our rehabilitation hospitals are used to create monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting for our leadership team. In order to benchmark ourselves against other hospitals, we collect our clinical and patient satisfaction information and compare it to national standards and the results of other healthcare organizations. We are required to report quality measures to individual states based on unique requirements and laws. We also submit required quality data elements to CMS. See “—Government Regulations—Other Medicare Regulations—Medicare Quality Reporting.”
Control Operating Costs. We continually seek to improve operating efficiency and control costs at our rehabilitation hospitals by standardizing operations and centralizing key administrative functions. These initiatives include:

• | centralizing administrative functions such as accounting, finance, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, and billing and collection;


• | standardizing management information systems to assist in capturing the medical record, accounting, billing, collections, and data capture and analysis; and


• | centralizing sourcing and contracting to receive discounted prices for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and other commodities used in our operations.

Increase Commercial Volume. We have focused on continued expansion of our relationships with commercial insurers to increase our volume of patients with commercial insurance in our rehabilitation hospitals. We believe that commercial payors seek to contract with our rehabilitation hospitals because we offer our patients high-quality, cost-effective care at more attractive rates than general acute care hospitals. We also offer commercial enrollees customized and comprehensive rehabilitation treatment programs not typically offered in general acute care hospitals.
Develop Rehabilitation Hospitals through Pursuing Joint Ventures with Large Healthcare Systems. By leveraging the experience of our senior management and development team, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our portfolio of joint ventured operations. When we identify joint venture opportunities, our development team conducts an extensive review of the area’s referral patterns and commercial insurance rates to determine the general reimbursement trends and payor mix. Once discussions commence with a healthcare system, we refine the specific needs of a joint venture, which could include working capital, the construction of new space, or the leasing and renovation of existing space. A joint venture typically consists of us and the healthcare system contributing certain post-acute care businesses into a newly formed entity. We typically function as the manager and hold either a majority or minority ownership interest. We bring clinical expertise and clinical programs that attract commercial payors and implement our standardized resource management programs, which may improve the clinical outcome and enhance the financial performance of the joint venture.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network of rehabilitation hospitals through opportunistic acquisitions. When we acquire a rehabilitation hospital or a group of related facilities, a team of our professionals is responsible for formulating and executing an integration plan. We seek to improve financial performance at such facilities by adding clinical programs that attract commercial payors, centralizing administrative functions, and implementing our standardized resource management programs.
Outpatient Rehabilitation
We are the largest operator of outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the United States based on number of facilities, with 1,662 facilities throughout 37 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018. Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics are typically located in a medical complex or retail location. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment employed approximately 10,400 people as of December 31, 2018.
In our outpatient rehabilitation clinics, we provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation programs and services. We also provide certain specialized programs such as functional programs for work related injuries, hand therapy, post-concussion rehabilitation, and athletic training services. The typical patient in one of our outpatient rehabilitation clinics suffers from musculoskeletal impairments that restrict his or her ability to perform normal activities of daily living. These impairments are often associated with accidents, sports injuries, work related injuries, or post-operative orthopedic and other medical conditions. Our rehabilitation programs and services are designed to help these patients minimize physical and cognitive impairments and maximize functional ability. We also provide services designed to prevent short term disabilities from becoming chronic conditions. Our rehabilitation services are provided by our professionals including licensed physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists.
Outpatient rehabilitation patients are generally referred or directed to our clinics by a physician, employer, or health insurer who believes that a patient, employee, or member can benefit from the level of therapy we provide in an outpatient setting. In recent years, a number of states have enacted laws that allow individuals to seek outpatient physical rehabilitation services without a physician order. Currently, this population of patients is not significant. In our outpatient rehabilitation segment, for the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 84% of our net operating revenues come from commercial payors, including healthcare insurers, managed care organizations, workers’ compensation programs, contract management services, and private pay sources. We believe that our services are attractive to healthcare payors who are seeking to provide high-quality and cost-effective care to their enrollees. The balance of our reimbursement is derived from Medicare and other government sponsored programs.
For a description of government regulations and Medicare payments made to our outpatient rehabilitation services, see “—Government Regulations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Outpatient Rehabilitation Strategy
The key elements of our outpatient rehabilitation strategy are to:
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. We are focused on providing a high level of service to our patients throughout their entire course of treatment. To measure satisfaction with our service we have developed surveys for both patients and physicians. Our clinics utilize the feedback from these surveys to continuously refine and improve service levels. We believe that by focusing on quality care and offering a high level of customer service we develop brand loyalty which allows us to strengthen our relationships with referring physicians, employers, and health insurers to drive additional patient volume.
Increase Market Share. We strive to establish a leading presence within the local areas we serve. To increase our presence, we seek to open new clinics in our existing markets. This allows us to realize economies of scale, heightened brand loyalty, and workforce continuity. We also focus on increasing our workers’ compensation and commercial/managed care payor mix.
Expand Rehabilitation Programs and Services. Through our local clinical directors of operations and clinic managers within their service areas, we assess the healthcare needs of the areas we serve. Based on these assessments, we implement additional programs and services specifically targeted to meet demand in the local community. In designing these programs we benefit from the knowledge we gain through our national network of clinics. This knowledge is used to design programs that optimize treatment methods and measure changes in health status, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction.

Optimize Payor Contract Reimbursements. We review payor contracts scheduled for renewal and potential new payor contracts to assure reasonable reimbursements for the services we provide. Before we enter into a new contract with a commercial payor, we evaluate it with the aid of our contract management system. We assess the reasonableness of the reimbursements by evaluating past and projected patient volume and clinic capacity. We create a retention strategy for the top performing contracts and a renegotiation strategy for contracts that do not meet our defined criteria. We believe that our national footprint and our strong reputation enable us to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates with commercial insurers.
Maintain Strong Community and Employee Relations. We believe that the relationships between our employees and the referral sources in their communities are critical to our success. Our referral sources, such as physicians and healthcare case managers, send their patients to our clinics based on three factors: the quality of our care, the customer service we provide, and their familiarity with our therapists. We seek to retain and motivate our therapists by implementing a performance-based bonus program, a defined career path with the ability to be promoted from within, timely communication on company developments, and internal training programs. We also focus on empowering our employees by giving them a high degree of autonomy in determining local area strategy. We seek to identify therapists who are potential business leaders. This management approach reflects the unique nature of each local area in which we operate and the importance of encouraging our employees to assume responsibility for their clinic’s financial and operational performance.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network of outpatient rehabilitation facilities through opportunistic acquisitions. We believe our size and centralized infrastructure allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies and improve financial performance at acquired facilities.
Concentra
We are the largest provider of occupational health services in the United States based on the number of facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 524 occupational health centers, 124 onsite clinics at employer worksites, and 31 CBOCs throughout 44 states. In some of our occupational health centers we also provide urgent care services. On February 1, 2018, we acquired U.S HealthWorks, an occupational medicine and urgent care service provider, as part of our Concentra segment. We deliver occupational medicine, consumer health, physical therapy, and veteran’s healthcare services in our occupational health centers, onsite clinics located at the workplaces of our employer customers, and our CBOCs. Our Concentra segment employed approximately 11,200 people as of December 31, 2018.
We offer a range of occupational and consumer health services through our occupational health centers and onsite clinics. Occupational health services include workers’ compensation injury care as well as employer services, clinical testing, wellness programs, and preventative care. Our services at the CBOCs include primary care, specialty care, sub-specialty care, mental health, and pharmacy benefits. Consumer health consists of non-employer, patient-directed treatment of injuries and illnesses. Our consumer health service offerings include urgent care, wellness programs, and preventative care.
Occupational medicine refers to the diagnosis and treatment of work-related injuries (workers’ compensation), compliance services, such as preventive services, including pre-employment, fitness-for-duty, and post-accident physical examinations and substance abuse screening. Utilization is driven by the needs of labor-intensive industries such as transportation, distribution/warehousing, manufacturing, construction, healthcare, police/fire, and other occupations that have historically posed a higher than average risk of workplace injury or that require a workplace physical. Workers’ compensation is the form of insurance that provides medical coverage to employees with work-related illnesses or injuries.
Workers’ compensation is administered on a state-by-state basis and each state is responsible for implementing and regulating its own workers’ compensation program. Because workers’ compensation benefits are mandated by law and subject to extensive regulation, insurers, third-party administrators, and employers do not have the same flexibility to alter benefits as they have with other health benefit programs. In addition, because programs vary by state, it is difficult for insurance companies and multi-state employers to adopt uniform policies to administer, manage, and control the costs of benefits across states. As a result, managing the cost of workers’ compensation requires approaches that are tailored to the specific regulatory environments in which the employer operates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 58% of our Concentra segment operating revenues came from workers’ compensation payments.
Acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks
On February 1, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the Equity Purchase and Contribution Agreement, dated October 22, 2017 with Concentra, Concentra Group Holdings Parent, U.S. HealthWorks (“U.S. Healthworks”) and Dignity Health Holding Corporation (“DHHC”), Concentra acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of U.S. HealthWorks, an occupational medicine and urgent care service provider. Concentra acquired U.S. HealthWorks for $753.6 million. DHHC, a subsidiary of Dignity Health, was issued a 20% equity interest in Concentra Group Holdings Parent, which was valued at $238.0 million. The remainder of the purchase price was paid in cash. Select currently retains a majority voting interest in Concentra Group Holdings Parent.
Concentra used borrowings under its first lien credit agreement and its second lien credit agreement, together with cash on hand, to pay the cash purchase price for all of the issued and outstanding stock of U.S. HealthWorks to DHHC, to finance the redemption and reorganization transactions executed under the Purchase Agreement, and to pay fees and expenses associated with the financing. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Commitments and Contingencies” for a description of Concentra’s indebtedness arrangements.
Concentra Strategy
The key elements of our Concentra strategy are to:
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. We strive to provide a high level of service to our patients and our employer customers. We measure and monitor patient and employer satisfaction and focus on treatment programs to provide the best clinical outcomes in a consistent manner. Our programs and services have proven that aggressive treatment and management of workers injuries can more rapidly restore employees to better health which reduces workers’ compensation indemnity claim costs for our employer customers.
Focus on Occupational Medicine. Our history as an industry leader in the provision of occupational medicine services provides the platform for Concentra to grow this service offering. Complementary service offerings help drive additional growth in this business line.
Pursue Direct Employer Relationships. We believe we provide occupational health services in a cost-effective manner to our employer customers. By establishing direct relationships with these customers, we seek to reduce overall costs of their workers’ compensation claims, while improving employee health, and getting their employees back to work faster.
Increase Presence in the Areas We Serve. We strive to establish a strong presence within the local areas we serve. To increase our presence, we seek to expand our services and programs and to open new occupational health centers and employer onsite locations. This allows us to realize economies of scale, heightened brand loyalty, and workforce continuity.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network and expand our geographic reach through opportunistic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks. We believe our size and centralized infrastructure allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies and improve financial performance at acquired facilities.
Other
Other activities include our corporate services and certain other minority investments in other healthcare related businesses. These include investments in companies that provide specialized technology and services to healthcare entities, as well as providers of complementary services.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the success of our business model is based on a number of competitive strengths, including our position as a leading operator in each of our business segments, our proven financial performance, our strong cash flow, our significant scale, our experience in completing and integrating acquisitions, our partnerships with large healthcare systems, our ability to capitalize on consolidation opportunities, and our experienced management team.
Leading Operator in Distinct but Complementary Lines of Business. We believe that we are a leading operator in our business segments based on number of facilities in the United States. Our leadership position and reputation as a high-quality, cost-effective healthcare provider in each of our business segments allows us to attract patients and employees, aids us in our marketing efforts to referral sources, and helps us negotiate payor contracts. In our critical illness recovery hospital segment, we operated 96 critical illness recovery hospitals in 27 states as of December 31, 2018. In our rehabilitation hospital segment, we operated 26 rehabilitation hospitals in 11 states as of December 31, 2018. In our outpatient rehabilitation segment, we operated 1,662 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 37 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018. In our Concentra segment, we operated 524 occupational health centers in 41 states as of December 31, 2018. With these leading positions in the areas we serve, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from the rising demand for medical services due to an aging population in the United States, which will drive growth across our business segments.
Proven Financial Performance and Strong Cash Flow. We have established a track record of improving the financial performance of our facilities due to our disciplined approach to revenue growth, expense management, and focus on free cash flow generation. This includes regular review of specific financial metrics of our business to determine trends in our revenue generation, expenses, billing, and cash collection. Based on the ongoing analysis of such trends, we make adjustments to our operations to optimize our financial performance and cash flow.
Significant Scale. By building significant scale in each of our business segments, we have been able to leverage our operating costs by centralizing administrative functions at our corporate office.
Experience in Successfully Completing and Integrating Acquisitions.  Since our inception in 1997 through 2018, we completed ten significant acquisitions for approximately $3.32 billion, which includes $418.6 million paid to acquire Physiotherapy, $1.05 billion paid to acquire Concentra, and $753.6 million paid to acquire U.S. HealthWorks. We believe that we have improved the operating performance of these businesses over time by applying our standard operating practices and by realizing efficiencies from our centralized operations and management.
Experience in Partnering with Large Healthcare Systems. Over the past several years we have partnered with large healthcare systems to provide post-acute care services. We believe that we provide operating expertise to these ventures through our experience in operating critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and outpatient rehabilitation facilities and have improved and expanded the level of post-acute care services provided in these communities, as well as the financial performance of these operations.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Consolidation Opportunities. We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on consolidation opportunities within each of our business segments and selectively augment our internal growth. We believe that each of our business segments is largely fragmented, with many of the nation’s critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and occupational health centers operated by independent operators lacking national or broad regional scope. With our geographically diversified portfolio of facilities in the United States, we believe that our footprint provides us with a wide-ranging perspective on multiple potential acquisition opportunities.
Experienced and Proven Management Team. Prior to co-founding our company with our current Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, our Vice Chairman and Co-Founder founded and operated three other healthcare companies focused on inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. The other members of our senior management team also have extensive experience in the healthcare industry, with an average of almost 25 years in the business. In recent years, we have reorganized our operations to expand executive talent and ensure management continuity.

Government Sources
Medicare is a federal program that provides medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state funded program, administered by the states, which provides medical benefits to individuals who are unable to afford healthcare. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 96 critical illness recovery hospitals, all of which were certified by Medicare as LTCHs. Also as of December 31, 2018, we operated 26 rehabilitation hospitals, all of which were certified by Medicare as IRFs . Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics regularly receive Medicare payments for their services. Our Concentra segment receives payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs and other governmental programs. Additionally, many of our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals participate in state Medicaid programs. Amounts received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally less than the customary charges for the services provided. In recent years, there have been significant changes made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since a significant portion of our revenues come from patients covered under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in the Medicare program. See “—Government Regulations—Overview of U.S. and State Government Reimbursements.”
Non-Government Sources
Our non-government sources of net operating revenue include insurance companies, workers’ compensation programs, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, other managed care companies, and employers, as well as patients directly. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 47,100 people throughout the United States. Approximately 33,700 of our employees are full-time and the remaining approximately 13,400 are part-time employees. Our critical illness recovery hospital segment employees totaled approximately 13,500, rehabilitation hospital segment employees totaled approximately 10,100, outpatient rehabilitation segment employees totaled approximately 10,400, and Concentra segment employees totaled approximately 11,200. Approximately 1,900 of the remaining employees performed corporate management, administration, and other support services primarily at our Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania headquarters.
Competition
Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals and Rehabilitation Hospitals 
Our critical illness recovery hospitals and our rehabilitation hospitals both compete on the basis of the quality of the patient services we provide, the outcomes we achieve for our patients, and the prices we charge for our services. The primary competitive factors in both of our critical illness recovery hospital and rehabilitation hospital segments include quality of services, charges for services, and responsiveness to the needs of patients, families, payors, and physicians. Other companies operate critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals that compete with our own hospitals, including large operators of similar facilities, such as Kindred Healthcare Inc. and Encompass Health Corporation, and rehabilitation units and step-down units operated by acute care hospitals in the markets we serve. The competitive position of a critical illness recovery hospital or a rehabilitation hospital is also affected by the ability of its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, managed care companies, preferred provider organizations, and health maintenance organizations. Such organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established critical illness recovery hospital or rehabilitation hospital charges. The importance of obtaining contracts with preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other organizations which finance healthcare, and its effect on a critical illness recovery hospital’s or rehabilitation hospital’s competitive position, vary from area to area depending on the number and strength of such organizations.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinics
Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics face a highly fragmented and competitive environment. The primary competitors that provide outpatient rehabilitation services include physician-owned physical therapy clinics, dedicated locally owned and managed outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and hospital or university owned or affiliated ventures, as well as national and regional providers in select areas, including Athletico Physical Therapy, ATI Physical Therapy, U.S. Physical Therapy, and Upstream Rehabilitation. Some of these competing clinics have longer operating histories and greater name recognition in these communities than our clinics, and they may have stronger relations with physicians in these communities on whom we rely for patient referrals. Because the barriers to entry are not substantial and current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, we believe that new outpatient physical therapy competitors can emerge relatively quickly.
Concentra
Our Concentra segment’s occupational health services, consumer health, and veteran’s healthcare business face a highly fragmented and competitive environment. The primary competitors that provide occupational health services have typically been independent physicians, hospital emergency departments, and hospital-owned or hospital-affiliated medical facilities. Because the barriers to entry are not substantial and Concentra’s current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, we believe that new competitors to Concentra can emerge relatively quickly. Furthermore, urgent care clinics in the local communities Concentra serves provide services similar to those Concentra offers, and, in some cases, competing facilities are more established or newer than Concentra’s, may offer a broader array of services to patients than Concentra’s, and may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to treat and serve patients. 
Government Regulations
General
The healthcare industry is required to comply with many complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. These laws and regulations require that hospitals and facilities furnishing outpatient services (including outpatient rehabilitation clinics, Concentra occupational health centers, onsite clinics, and CBOCs) comply with various requirements and standards. These laws and regulations include those relating to the adequacy of medical care, facilities and equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and recordkeeping, as well as standards for reimbursement, fraud and abuse prevention, and health information privacy and security. These laws and regulations are extremely complex, often overlap and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs.
Facility Licensure
Our healthcare facilities are subject to state and local licensing statutes and regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. In order to assure continued compliance with these various regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our facilities, both at scheduled intervals and in response to complaints from patients and others. While our facilities intend to comply with existing licensing standards, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given time. In addition, the state and local licensing laws are subject to changes or new interpretations that could impose additional burdens on our facilities. A determination by an applicable regulatory authority that a facility is not in compliance with these requirements could lead to the imposition of corrective action, assessment of fines and penalties, or loss of licensure, Medicare enrollment, certification or accreditation. These consequences could have an adverse effect on our company.
Some states still require us to get approval under certificate of need regulations when we create, acquire, or expand our facilities or services, or alter the ownership of such facilities, whether directly or indirectly. The certificate of need regulations vary from state to state, and are subject to change and new interpretation. If we fail to show public need and obtain approval in these states for our new facilities or changes to the ownership structure of existing facilities, we may be subject to civil or even criminal penalties, lose our facility license, or become ineligible for reimbursement.
Professional Licensure, Corporate Practice and Fee-Splitting Laws
Healthcare professionals at our critical illness recovery hospitals, our rehabilitation hospitals, and our facilities furnishing outpatient services are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law. We take steps to ensure that our employees and agents possess all necessary licenses and certifications.
Some states prohibit the “corporate practice of medicine,” which restricts business corporations from practicing medicine through the direct employment of physicians or from exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. Some states similarly prohibit the “corporate practice of therapy.” The laws relating to corporate practice vary from state to state and are not fully developed in each state in which we have facilities. Typically, however, professional corporations owned and controlled by licensed professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ physicians or therapists to furnish professional services. Also, in some states, hospitals are permitted to employ physicians.
Some states also prohibit entities from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians or therapists. The laws relating to fee-splitting also vary from state to state and are not fully developed. Generally, these laws restrict business arrangements that involve a physician or therapist sharing medical fees with a referral source, but in some states these laws have been interpreted to extend to management agreements between physicians or therapists and business entities under some circumstances.
We believe that each of our facilities, licensed physicians, and therapists comply with any current corporate practice and fee-splitting laws of the state in which they are located. In states where we are prohibited by the corporate practice of medicine from directly employing licensed physicians, we typically enter into management agreements with professional corporations that are owned by licensed physicians, which, in turn, employ or contract with physicians who provide professional medical services in our facilities. Under those management agreements, we perform only non-medical administrative services, do not exercise control over the practice of medicine by the physicians, and structure compensation to avoid fee-splitting. In those states that apply the corporate practice of therapy prohibition, we either contract to obtain therapy services from an entity permitted to employ therapists or we manage the physical therapy practice owned by licensed therapists through which the therapy services are provided.
Although we believe that our facilities comply with corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, if new regulations or judicial or administrative interpretations establish that our facilities do not comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil and perhaps criminal penalties. In addition, if any of our facilities is determined not to comply with corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, certain of our agreements relating to the facility may be determined to be unenforceable, including our management agreements with the professional corporations furnishing physician services or our payment arrangements with insurers or employers. Future interpretations of corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, the enactment of new legislation, or the adoption of new regulations relating to these laws could cause us to have to restructure our business operations or close our facilities in a particular state. Any such penalties, determinations of unenforceability, or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Medicare Enrollment and Certification
In order to participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare reimbursement, each facility must comply with the applicable regulations of the United States Department of Health and Human Services relating to, among other things, the type of facility, its equipment, its personnel, and its standards of medical care, as well as compliance with all applicable state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2018, all of the critical illness recovery hospitals we operated were certified by Medicare as LTCHs. As of December 31, 2018, all of the rehabilitation hospitals we operated were certified by Medicare as IRFs. In addition, we provide the majority of our outpatient rehabilitation services through outpatient rehabilitation clinics certified by Medicare as rehabilitation agencies or “rehab agencies,” which operate as outpatient rehabilitation providers for the purposes of the Medicare program. Our Concentra occupational health centers furnishing outpatient services are generally enrolled in Medicare as suppliers.
Accreditation
Our critical illness recovery hospitals and our rehabilitation hospitals receive accreditation from TJC, DNV and/or CARF. As of December 31, 2018, all of the 96 critical illness recovery hospitals and all of the 26 rehabilitation hospitals we operated were accredited by TJC or DNV. In addition, 12 of our rehabilitation hospitals have also received accreditation from CARF. Where required under our contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs, our facilities furnishing outpatient services that operate as CBOCs are accredited by TJC or another healthcare accrediting organization. See “—Government Regulations—Veterans Affairs.”
Workers’ Compensation
Workers’ compensation is a state mandated, comprehensive insurance program that requires employers to fund or insure medical expenses, lost wages, and other costs resulting from work related injuries and illnesses. Workers’ compensation benefits and arrangements vary from state to state, and are often highly complex. In some states, payment for services covered by workers’ compensation programs are subject to cost containment features, such as requirements that all workers’ compensation injuries be treated through a managed care program, or the imposition of fee schedules or payment caps for services furnished to injured employees. Some state workers’ compensation laws limit the ability of an employer to select the providers furnishing care to injured employees. Several states require that physicians furnishing non-emergency services to workers’ compensation patients must register with the applicable state agency and undergo special continuing education and training. Workers’ compensation programs may also impose other requirements that affect the operations of our facilities furnishing outpatient services. Net operating revenues generated directly from workers’ compensation programs represented approximately 18% of our net operating revenue from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, 1% of our net operating revenue from our critical illness recovery hospital segment, 2% of our net operating revenue from our rehabilitation hospital segment, and 58% of our net operating revenue from our Concentra segment for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our facilities furnishing outpatient services are reimbursed for services furnished to injured workers by payors pursuant to the applicable state workers’ compensation statutes. Most of the states in which we maintain operations reimburse providers for services payable under workers’ compensation laws pursuant to a treatment-specific fee schedule with established maximum reimbursement levels. In states without such fee schedules, healthcare providers are often reimbursed based on “usual and customary” fees benchmarked by market data and negotiated by providers with payors and networks.
Inadequate increases to the applicable fee schedule amounts for our services, and changes in state workers’ compensation laws, including cost containment initiatives, could have a negative impact on the operations and financial performance of those facilities.
Veterans Affairs
As of December 31, 2018, we had 31 CBOCs, which were established to provide services to veterans residing in catchment areas under agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The awarding of such agreements is regulated by laws related to federal government procurements generally, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Our contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs include administrative and clinical services, performance standards, qualifications and other contractor requirements and information and security requirements. In general, our facilities furnishing outpatient services that are CBOCs provide outpatient primary care and mental healthcare in exchange for a capitated monthly fee based on the number of eligible patients then enrolled in that CBOC.
Overview of U.S. and State Government Reimbursements
Medicare Program in General
The Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, which are generally persons age 65 and older, those who are chronically disabled, and those suffering from end stage renal disease. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 and is administered primarily by the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS. The table below shows the percentage of net operating revenues generated directly from the Medicare program for each of our segments and our company as a whole for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
Medicare Net Operating Revenues by Segment | 2016 | | 2017 | | 2018
Critical illness recovery hospital | 53.3 | % | | 52.4 | % | 50.9 | %
Rehabilitation hospital | 38.4 | % | | 41.6 | % | 41.5 | %
Outpatient rehabilitation | 13.9 | % | | 14.8 | % | 15.2 | %
Concentra | 0.2 | % | | 0.2 | % | 0.1 | %
Total Company | 30.0 | % | | 30.1 | % | 26.6 | %

The Medicare program reimburses various types of providers, including LTCHs, IRFs, and outpatient rehabilitation providers, using different payment methodologies. The Medicare reimbursement systems specific to LTCHs, IRFs, and outpatient rehabilitation providers, as described herein, are different than the system applicable to general acute care hospitals. If any of our hospitals fail to comply with requirements for payment under Medicare reimbursement systems for LTCHs or IRFs, as applicable, that hospital will be paid under the system applicable to general acute care hospitals. For general acute care hospitals, Medicare payments for inpatient care are made under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) under which a hospital receives a fixed payment amount per discharge (adjusted for area wage differences) using Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (“MS-DRGs”). The general acute care hospital MS-DRG payment rate is based upon the national average cost of treating a Medicare patient’s condition, based on severity levels of illness, in that type of facility. Although the average length of stay varies for each MS-DRG, the average stay of all Medicare patients in a general acute care hospital is substantially less than the average length of stay in LTCHs and IRFs. Thus, the prospective payment system for general acute care hospitals creates an economic incentive for those hospitals to discharge medically complex Medicare patients to a post-acute care setting as soon as clinically possible. Effective October 1, 2005, CMS expanded its post-acute care transfer policy under which general acute care hospitals are paid on a per diem basis rather than the full MS-DRG rate if a patient is discharged early to certain post-acute care settings, including LTCHs and IRFs. When a patient is discharged from selected MS-DRGs to, among other providers, an LTCH or IRF, the general acute care hospital may be reimbursed below the full MS-DRG payment if the patient’s length of stay is less than the geometric mean length of stay for the MS-DRG.
Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services
The Medicare payment system for LTCHs is based on a prospective payment system specifically applicable to LTCHs (“LTCH-PPS”). The policies and payment rates under LTCH-PPS are subject to annual updates and revisions. Under LTCH-PPS, each patient discharged from an LTCH is assigned to a distinct “MS-LTC-DRG,” which is a Medicare severity long-term care diagnosis-related group for LTCHs, and an LTCH is generally paid a pre-determined fixed amount applicable to the assigned MS-LTC-DRG (adjusted for area wage differences), subject to exceptions for short stay and high cost outlier patients (described below). CMS assigns relative weights to each MS-LTC-DRG to reflect their relative use of medical care resources. The payment amount for each MS-LTC-DRG is intended to reflect the average cost of treating a Medicare patient assigned to that MS-LTC-DRG in an LTCH.
Standard Federal Rate
Payment under the LTCH-PPS is dependent on determining the patient classification, that is, the assignment of the case to a particular MS-LTC-DRG, the weight of the MS-LTC-DRG, and the standard federal payment rate. There is a single standard federal rate that encompasses both the inpatient operating costs, which includes a labor and non-labor component, and capital-related costs that CMS updates on an annual basis. LTCH-PPS also includes special payment policies that adjust the payments for some patients based on the patient’s length of stay, the facility’s costs, whether the patient was discharged and readmitted, and other factors.
Patient Criteria
The BBA of 2013, enacted December 26, 2013, establishes a dual-rate LTCH-PPS for Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH. Specifically, for Medicare patients discharged in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, LTCHs will be reimbursed at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate only if, immediately preceding the patient’s LTCH admission, the patient was discharged from a “subsection (d) hospital” (generally, a short-term acute care hospital paid under IPPS) and either the patient’s stay included at least three days in an intensive care unit (ICU) or coronary care unit (CCU) at the subsection (d) hospital, or the patient was assigned to an MS-LTC-DRG for cases receiving at least 96 hours of ventilator services in the LTCH. In addition, to be paid at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate, the patient’s discharge from the LTCH may not include a principal diagnosis relating to psychiatric or rehabilitation services. For any Medicare patient who does not meet these criteria, the LTCH will be paid a lower “site-neutral” payment rate, which will be the lower of: (i) the IPPS comparable per-diem payment rate capped at the MS-DRG payment rate plus any outlier payments; or (ii) 100 percent of the estimated costs for services.
The site neutral payment rate for those patients not paid at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate is subject to a transition period. During the transition period (applicable to hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2019), a blended rate will be paid for Medicare patients not meeting the new criteria that is equal to 50% of the site neutral payment rate amount and 50% of the standard federal payment rate amount. For discharges in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, only the site neutral payment rate will apply for Medicare patients not meeting the new criteria. For hospital discharges beginning on or after October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2026, the IPPS comparable per diem payment amount (including any applicable outlier payment) used to determine the site neutral payment rate will be reduced by 4.6% after any annual payment rate update.
In addition, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, LTCH patient criteria compliant discharges from an LTCH will continue to be paid at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate, unless the number of Medicare discharges for which payment is made under the site-neutral payment rate is greater than 50% of the total number of discharges from the LTCH for that period. If the number of Medicare discharges for which payment is made under the site-neutral payment rate is greater than 50%, then beginning in the next cost reporting period all Medicare discharges from the LTCH will be reimbursed at the site-neutral payment rate. The BBA of 2013 requires CMS to establish a process for an LTCH subject to only the site-neutral payment rate to be reinstated for payment under the dual-rate LTCH-PPS.
Payment adjustments, including the interrupted stay policy (discussed herein), apply to LTCH discharges regardless of whether the case is paid at the standard federal payment rate or the site-neutral payment rate. However, short stay outlier payment adjustments do not apply to cases paid at the site-neutral payment rate. CMS calculates the annual recalibration of the MS-LTC-DRG relative payment weighting factors using only data from LTCH discharges that meet the criteria for exclusion from the site-neutral payment rate. In addition, CMS applies the IPPS fixed-loss amount for high cost outliers to site-neutral cases, rather than the LTCH-PPS fixed-loss amount. CMS calculates the LTCH-PPS fixed-loss amount using only data from cases paid at the LTCH-PPS payment rate, excluding cases paid at the site-neutral rate.
Short Stay Outlier Policy
CMS established a different payment methodology for Medicare patients with a length of stay less than or equal to five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay for that particular MS-LTC-DRG, referred to as a short stay outlier (“SSO”). SSO cases are paid based on a per diem rate derived from blending 120% of the MS‑LTC‑DRG specific per diem amount with a per diem rate based on the general acute care hospital IPPS. Under this policy, as the length of stay of a SSO case increases, the percentage of the per diem payment amounts based on the full MS-LTCH-DRG standard federal payment rate increases and the percentage of the payment based on the IPPS comparable amount decreases.
High Cost Outliers
Some cases are extraordinarily costly, producing losses that may be too large for hospitals to offset. Cases with unusually high costs, referred to as “high cost outliers,” receive a payment adjustment to reflect the additional resources utilized. CMS provides an additional payment if the estimated costs for the patient exceed the adjusted MS-LTC-DRG payment plus a fixed-loss amount that is established in the annual payment rate update.
Interrupted Stays
An interrupted stay is defined as a case in which an LTCH patient, upon discharge, is admitted to a general acute care hospital, IRF or skilled nursing facility/swing-bed and then returns to the same LTCH within a specified period of time. If the length of stay at the receiving provider is equal to or less than the applicable fixed period of time, it is considered to be an interrupted stay case and the case is treated as a single discharge for the purposes of payment to the LTCH. For interrupted stays of three days or less, Medicare payments for any test, procedure, or care provided to an LTCH patient on an outpatient basis or for any inpatient treatment during the “interruption” would be the responsibility of the LTCH.
Freestanding, HIH, and Satellite LTCHs
LTCHs may be organized and operated as freestanding facilities or as HIHs. As its name suggests, a freestanding LTCH is not located on the campus of another hospital. For such purpose, “campus” means the physical area immediately adjacent to a hospital’s main buildings, other areas, and structures that are not strictly contiguous to a hospital’s main buildings but are located within 250 yards of its main buildings, and any other areas determined, on an individual case basis by the applicable CMS regional office, to be part of a hospital’s campus. Conversely, an HIH is an LTCH that is located on the campus of another hospital. An LTCH, whether freestanding or an HIH, that uses the same Medicare provider number of an affiliated “primary site” LTCH is known as a “satellite.” Under Medicare policy, a satellite LTCH must be located within 35 miles of its primary site LTCH and be administered by such primary site LTCH. A primary site LTCH may have more than one satellite LTCH. CMS sometimes refers to a satellite LTCH that is freestanding as a “remote location.” LTCH HIHs and satellites must comply with  certain requirements to show that they operate as part of the main LTCH, and not the co-located hospital. Most or all of these requirements no longer apply to LTCHs that are located on the same campus as other hospitals excluded from the IPPS (e.g., LTCHs and IRFs), provided that an IPPS hospital is not also located on that campus.
Facility Certification Criteria
The LTCH-PPS regulations define the criteria that must be met in order for a hospital to be certified as an LTCH. To be eligible for payment under the LTCH-PPS, a hospital must be primarily engaged in providing inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries with medically complex conditions that require a long hospital stay. In addition, by definition, LTCHs must meet certain facility criteria, including: (i) instituting a review process that screens patients for appropriateness of an admission and validates the patient criteria within 48 hours of each patient’s admission, evaluates regularly their patients for continuation of care, and assesses the available discharge options; (ii) having active physician involvement with patient care that includes a physician available on-site daily and additional consulting physicians on call; and (iii) having an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals to prepare and carry out an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
An LTCH must have an average inpatient length of stay for Medicare patients (including both Medicare covered and non-covered days) of greater than 25 days. LTCH cases paid at the site-neutral rate and Medicare Advantage cases are excluded from the LTCH average length of stay calculation. LTCHs that fail to exceed an average length of stay of 25 days during any cost reporting period may be paid under the general acute care hospital IPPS if not corrected within established time frames. CMS, through its contractors, determines whether an LTCH has maintained an average length of stay of greater than 25 days during each annual cost reporting period.
Prior to qualifying under the payment system applicable to LTCHs, a new LTCH initially receives payments under the general acute care hospital IPPS. The LTCH must continue to be paid under this system for a minimum of six months while meeting certain Medicare LTCH requirements, the most significant requirement being an average length of stay for Medicare patients (including both Medicare covered and non-covered days) greater than 25 days.
25 Percent Rule
The “25 Percent Rule” was a downward payment adjustment that applied if the percentage of Medicare patients discharged from LTCHs who were admitted from a referring hospital (regardless of whether the LTCH or LTCH satellite is co-located with the referring hospital) exceeded the applicable percentage admissions threshold during a particular cost reporting period.
CMS was precluded from applying the 25 Percent Rule for freestanding LTCHs to cost reporting years beginning before July 1, 2016 and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2016 and before October 1, 2017. In addition, the law applied higher percentage admissions thresholds for most LTCHs operating as HIHs and satellites for cost reporting years beginning before July 1, 2016 and effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2016 and before October 1, 2017.
For fiscal year 2018, CMS adopted a regulatory moratorium on the implementation of the 25 Percent Rule.
For fiscal year 2019 and thereafter, CMS eliminated the 25 Percent Rule entirely. The elimination of the 25 Percent Rule is being implemented in a budget-neutral manner by adjusting the standard federal payment rates down such that the projection of aggregate LTCH payments would equal the projection of aggregate LTCH payments that would have been paid if the moratorium ended and the 25 Percent Rule went into effect on October 1, 2018. As a result, the elimination of the 25 Percent Rule includes a temporary, one-time adjustment of 0.990878 to the fiscal year 2019 LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate, a temporary, one-time adjustment of 0.990737 to the fiscal year 2020 LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate, and a permanent, one-time adjustment of 0.991249 to the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate in fiscal years 2021 and subsequent years. 
Annual Payment Rate Update
Fiscal Year 2017. On August 22, 2016, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2017 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017). The standard federal rate was set at $42,476, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2016 of $41,763. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2017 included a market basket increase of 2.8%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.3%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”). The fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $21,943, an increase from the fixed loss amount in the 2016 fiscal year of $16,423. The fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site neutral payment rate was set at $23,573, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2016 fiscal year of $22,538.
Fiscal Year 2018. On August 14, 2017, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2018 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018). Certain errors in the final rule published on August 14, 2017 were corrected in a final rule published October 4, 2017. The standard federal rate was set at $41,415, a decrease from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2017 of $42,476. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2018 included a market basket increase of 2.7%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.6%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2018 was further impacted by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which limits the update for fiscal year 2018 to 1.0%. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $27,381, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2017 fiscal year of $21,943. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $26,537, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2017 fiscal year of $23,573.
Fiscal Year 2019. On August 17, 2018, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2019 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a final rule published October 3, 2018. The standard federal rate was set at $41,559, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2018 of $41,415. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2019 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.8%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget-neutrality factor of 0.999215 and a temporary, one-time budget-neutrality adjustment of 0.990878 in connection with the elimination of the 25 Percent Rule (described herein). The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $27,121, a decrease from the fixed-loss amount in the 2018 fiscal year of $27,381. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $25,743, a decrease from the fixed-loss amount in the 2018 fiscal year of $26,537.
Medicare Reimbursement of IRF Services
IRFs are paid under a prospective payment system specifically applicable to this provider type, which is referred to as “IRF-PPS.” Under the IRF-PPS, each patient discharged from an IRF is assigned to a case mix group (“IRF-CMG”) containing patients with similar clinical conditions that are expected to require similar amounts of resources. An IRF is generally paid a pre-determined fixed amount applicable to the assigned IRF-CMG (subject to applicable case adjustments related to length of stay and facility level adjustments for location and low income patients). The payment amount for each IRF-CMG is intended to reflect the average cost of treating a Medicare patient’s condition in an IRF relative to patients with conditions described by other IRF-CMGs. The IRF-PPS also includes special payment policies that adjust the payments for some patients based on the patient’s length of stay, the facility’s costs, whether the patient was discharged and readmitted and other factors.
Facility Certification Criteria
Our rehabilitation hospitals must meet certain facility criteria to be classified as an IRF by the Medicare program, including: (i) a provider agreement to participate as a hospital in Medicare; (ii) a pre-admission screening procedure; (iii) ensuring that patients receive close medical supervision and furnish, through the use of qualified personnel, rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, plus, as needed, speech therapy, social or psychological services, and orthotic and prosthetic services; (iv) a full-time, qualified director of rehabilitation; (v) a plan of treatment for each inpatient that is established, reviewed, and revised as needed by a physician in consultation with other professional personnel who provide services to the patient; and (vi) a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach in the rehabilitation of each inpatient, as documented by periodic clinical entries made in the patient’s medical record to note the patient’s status in relationship to goal attainment, and that team conferences are held at least every two weeks to determine the appropriateness of treatment. Failure to comply with any of the classification criteria may result in the denial of claims for payment or cause a hospital to lose its status as an IRF and be paid under the prospective payment system that applies to general acute care hospitals.
Patient Classification Criteria
In order to qualify as an IRF, a hospital must demonstrate that during its most recent 12-month cost reporting period, it served an inpatient population of whom at least 60% required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 conditions specified by regulation. Compliance with the 60% Rule is demonstrated through either medical review or the “presumptive” method, in which a patient’s diagnosis codes are compared to a “presumptive compliance” list. For fiscal year 2018, CMS revised the 60% Rule’s presumptive methodology (i) including certain International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (“ICD-10-CM”) diagnosis codes for patients with traumatic brain injury and hip fracture conditions and (ii) revising the presumptive methodology list for major multiple trauma by counting IRF cases that contain two or more of the ICD-10-CM codes from three major multiple trauma lists in the specified combinations.
Annual Payment Rate Update
Fiscal Year 2017. On August 5, 2016, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2017 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2017 was set at $15,708, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2016 of $15,478. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2017 included a market basket increase of 2.7%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.3%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2017 to $7,984 from $8,658 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2016.
Fiscal Year 2018. On August 3, 2017, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2018 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2018 was set at $15,838, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2017 of $15,708. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2018 included a market basket increase of 2.6%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.6%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2018 was further impacted by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which limited the update for fiscal year 2018 to 1.0%. CMS increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2018 to $8,679 from $7,984 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2017.
Fiscal Year 2019. On August 6, 2018, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2019 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2019 was set at $16,021, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2018 of $15,838. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2019 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.8%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. CMS increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2019 to $9,402 from $8,679 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2018.
Medicare Reimbursement of Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinic Services
The Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare physician fee schedule. For services provided in 2017 through 2019, a 0.5% update will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to an adjustment beginning in 2019 under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”). For services provided in 2020 through 2025, a 0.0% percent update will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to adjustments under MIPS and the alternative payment models (“APMs”). In 2026 and subsequent years eligible professionals participating in APMs that meet certain criteria would receive annual updates of 0.75%, while all other professionals would receive annual updates of 0.25%.
Beginning in 2019, payments under the fee schedule are subject to adjustment based on performance in MIPS, which measures performance based on certain quality metrics, resource use, and meaningful use of electronic health records. Under the MIPS requirements a provider’s performance is assessed according to established performance standards and used to determine an adjustment factor that is then applied to the professional’s payment for a year. Each year from 2019 through 2024, professionals who receive a significant share of their revenues through an APM (such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements) that involves risk of financial losses and a quality measurement component will receive a 5% bonus. The bonus payment for APM participation is intended to encourage participation and testing of new APMs and to promote the alignment of incentives across payors. MIPS and APM apply to physicians and other practitioners included within the definition of “eligible clinicians.” Currently, physical therapists and occupational therapists may voluntarily participate in MIPS and APM. In the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule for calendar year 2019, CMS adopted a final policy to include physical therapists, occupational therapists and qualified speech-language pathologists as “eligible clinicians” and require them to participate in these programs beginning in the 2021 MIPS payment year. The specifics of the MIPS and APM adjustments beginning in 2019 and 2020, respectively, remain subject to future notice and comment rule-making. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately 15% of our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues from Medicare.
Therapy Caps
Outpatient therapy providers reimbursed under the Medicare physician fee schedule have been subject to annual limits for therapy expenses. For example, for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2017, the annual limit on outpatient therapy services was $1,980 for combined physical and speech language pathology services and $1,980 for occupational therapy services. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 repealed the annual limits on outpatient therapy.
The annual limits for therapy expenses historically did not apply to services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments. However, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 and prior legislation extended the annual limits on therapy expenses in hospital outpatient department settings through December 31, 2017. The application of annual limits to hospital outpatient department settings sunset on December 31, 2017. 
Prior to calendar year 2028, all therapy claims exceeding $3,000 are subject to a manual medical review process. The $3,000 threshold is applied to physical therapy and speech therapy services combined and separately applied to occupational therapy. CMS will continue to require that an appropriate modifier be included on claims over the current exception threshold indicating that the therapy services are medically necessary. Beginning in 2028 and in each calendar year thereafter, the threshold amount for claims requiring manual medical review will increase by the percentage increase in the Medicare Economic Index.
Modifiers to Identify Services of Physical Therapy Assistants or Occupational Therapy Assistants
In the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule for calendar year 2019, CMS established two new modifiers to identify services furnished in whole or in part by physical therapy assistants (“PTAs”) or occupational therapy assistants (“OTAs”). These modifiers were mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which requires that claims for outpatient therapy services furnished in whole or part by therapy assistants on or after January 1, 2020 include the appropriate modifier. CMS intends to use these modifiers to implement a payment differential that would reimburse services provided by PTAs and OTAs at 85% of the fee schedule rate beginning on January 1, 2022. 
Other Requirements for Payment
Historically, outpatient rehabilitation services have been subject to scrutiny by the Medicare program for, among other things, medical necessity for services, appropriate documentation for services, supervision of therapy aides and students, and billing for single rather than group therapy when services are furnished to more than one patient. CMS has issued guidance to clarify that services performed by a student are not reimbursed even if provided under “line of sight” supervision of the therapist. Likewise, CMS has reiterated that Medicare does not pay for services provided by aides regardless of the level of supervision. CMS also has issued instructions that outpatient physical and occupational therapy services provided simultaneously to two or more individuals by a practitioner should be billed as group therapy services.
Medicare claims for outpatient therapy services furnished by therapy assistants on or after January 1, 2022 must include a modifier indicating the service was furnished by a therapy assistant. CMS is required to develop a modifier to mark services provided by a therapy assistant by January 1, 2019, and then submitted claims have to report the modifier mark starting January 1, 2020. Outpatient therapy services furnished on or after January 1, 2022 in whole or part by a therapy assistant will be paid at an amount equal to 85% of the payment amount otherwise applicable for the service. 
Medicaid Reimbursement of LTCH and IRF Services
The Medicaid program is designed to provide medical assistance to individuals unable to afford care. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965, funded jointly by each individual state and the federal government and administered by state agencies. Medicaid payments are made under a number of different systems, which include cost based reimbursement, prospective payment systems, or programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. In addition, Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy by the state agencies, and certain government funding limitations, all of which may increase or decrease the level of program payments to our hospitals. Net operating revenues generated directly from the Medicaid program represented approximately 7% of our critical illness recovery hospital segment net operating revenues and 1% of our rehabilitation hospital segment net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Healthcare Regulations
Medicare Quality Reporting
LTCHs and IRFs are subject to mandatory quality reporting requirements. LTCHs and IRFs that do not submit the required quality data will be subject to a 2% reduction in their annual payment update. The reduction can result in payment rates less than the prior year. However, the reduction will not carry over into the subsequent fiscal years.
LTCHs and IRFs are required to collect and report patient assessment data and clinical measures on each Medicare beneficiary who receives inpatient services in our facilities. We began reporting this data on October 1, 2012. CMS began making this data available to the public on the CMS website in December 2016. CMS is now adding cross-setting quality measures to compare quality and resource data across post-acute settings pursuant to the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-185) (the “IMPACT Act”).
Medicare Hospital Wage Index Adjustment
As part of the methodology for determining prospective payments to LTCHs and IRFs, CMS adjusts the standard payment amounts for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level. This adjustment factor is the hospital wage index. CMS currently defines hospital geographic areas (labor market areas) based on the definitions of Core-Based Statistical Areas established by the Office of Management and Budget. The ACA calls for CMS to develop and present to Congress a comprehensive reform plan using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, or other data or methodologies, to calculate relative wages for each geographic area involved. In the preamble to the proposed rule for LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2012, CMS solicited public comments on ways to redefine the geographic reclassification requirements to more accurately define labor markets. To date, CMS has not presented a comprehensive reform plan to Congress.
Physician-Owned Hospital Limitations
CMS regulations include a number of hospital ownership and physician referral provisions, including certain obligations requiring physician-owned hospitals to disclose ownership or investment interests held by the referring physician or his or her immediate family members. In particular, physician-owned hospitals must furnish to patients, on request, a list of physicians or immediate family members who own or invest in the hospital. Moreover, a physician-owned hospital must require all physician owners or investors who are also active members of the hospital’s medical staff to disclose in writing their ownership or investment interests in the hospital to all patients they refer to the hospital. CMS can terminate the Medicare provider agreement of a physician-owned hospital if it fails to comply with these disclosure provisions or with the requirement that a hospital disclose in writing to all patients whether there is a physician on-site at the hospital, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
Under the transparency and program integrity provisions of the ACA, the exception to the federal self-referral law (the “Stark Law”) that permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an ownership or investment interest has been dramatically curtailed. Only hospitals with physician ownership and a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the percentage of physician ownership or investment interests held in the hospital after March 23, 2010. In addition, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, unless meeting specific exceptions related to the hospital’s location and patient population. In order to retain their exemption from the general ban on self-referrals, our physician-owned hospitals are required to adopt specific measures relating to conflicts of interest, bona fide investments and patient safety. As of December 31, 2018, we operated six hospitals that are owned in-part by physicians.
Medicare Recovery Audit Contractors
CMS contracts with third-party organizations, known as Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) to identify Medicare underpayments and overpayments, and to authorize RACs to recoup any overpayments. The compensation paid to each RAC is based on a percentage of overpayment recoveries identified by the RAC. CMS has selected and entered into contracts with four RACs, each of which has begun their audit activities in specific jurisdictions. RAC audits of our Medicare reimbursement may lead to assertions that we have been overpaid, require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict the impact of future RAC reviews on our results of operations or cash flows.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
Various federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain payment under Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs. Penalties for violation of these laws include civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. In recent years, federal and state government agencies have increased the level of enforcement resources and activities targeted at the healthcare industry. In addition, the federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes allow individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government, in what are known as qui tam or “whistleblower” actions, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute. The use of these private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically in recent years, in part because the individual filing the initial complaint is entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment. Revisions to the False Claims Act enacted in 2009 expanded significantly the scope of liability, provided for new investigative tools, and made it easier for whistleblowers to bring and maintain False Claims Act suits on behalf of the government. See “—Legal Proceedings.”
From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) issue a variety of pronouncements, including fraud alerts, the OIG’s Annual Work Plan, and other reports, identifying practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny. These pronouncements can identify issues relating to LTCHs, IRFs, or outpatient rehabilitation services or providers. For example, the OIG recently announced that it will (1) determine whether Medicare appropriately paid hospitals’ inpatient claims subject to the post-acute care transfer policy, (2) determine whether Medicare physician payments for critical care are appropriate and paid in accordance with Medicare requirements, and (3) examine up-coding of inpatient hospital billing by comparing how billing has changed over time and how billing varied among hospitals. We monitor government publications applicable to us to supplement and enhance our compliance efforts.
We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, including healthcare fraud and abuse laws. If we identify any practices as being potentially contrary to applicable law, we will take appropriate action to address the matter, including, where appropriate, disclosure to the proper authorities, which may result in a voluntary refund of monies to Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental healthcare programs.
Remuneration and Fraud Measures
The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits some business practices and relationships under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. These practices include the payment, receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration in connection with, to induce, or to arrange for, the referral of patients covered by a federal or state healthcare program. Violations of the anti-kickback law may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for each violation, or both, civil monetary penalties of $50,000 and damages of up to three times the total amount of remuneration, and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs.
The Stark Law prohibits referrals for designated health services by physicians under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to other healthcare providers in which the physicians have an ownership or compensation arrangement unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided, assessments equal to three times the dollar value of each such service provided, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs. The statute also provides a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. In addition, many states have adopted or may adopt similar anti-kickback or anti-self-referral statutes. Some of these statutes prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients, regardless of the source of the payment for the care. While we do not believe our arrangements are in violation of these prohibitions, we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing the provisions of these prohibitions will not assert that one or more of our arrangements are in violation of the provisions of such laws and regulations.
Provider-Based Status
The designation “provider-based” refers to circumstances in which a subordinate facility (e.g., a separately certified Medicare provider, a department of a provider, or a satellite facility) is treated as part of a provider for Medicare payment purposes. In these cases, the services of the subordinate facility are included on the “main” provider’s cost report and overhead costs of the main provider can be allocated to the subordinate facility, to the extent that they are shared. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 18 critical illness recovery hospitals and six rehabilitation hospitals that were treated as provider-based satellites of certain of our other facilities, 234 of the outpatient rehabilitation clinics we operated were provider-based and are operated as departments of the rehabilitation hospitals we operated, and we provide rehabilitation management and staffing services to hospital rehabilitation departments that may be treated as provider-based. These facilities are required to satisfy certain operational standards in order to retain their provider-based status.
Health Information Practices
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) mandates the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare industry, while maintaining the privacy and security of health information. Among the standards that the Department of Health and Human Services has adopted or will adopt pursuant to HIPAA are standards for electronic transactions and code sets, unique identifiers for providers (referred to as National Provider Identifier), employers, health plans and individuals, security and electronic signatures, privacy, and enforcement. If we fail to comply with the HIPAA requirements, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions. The privacy, security and enforcement provisions of HIPAA were enhanced by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which was included in the ARRA. Among other things, HITECH establishes security breach notification requirements, allows enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increases penalties for HIPAA violations.
The Department of Health and Human Services has adopted standards in three areas in which we are required to comply that affect our operations.
Standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information govern our use and disclosure of protected health information and require us to impose those rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom such information is disclosed.
Standards relating to electronic transactions and code sets require the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions, including healthcare claims information, plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment and disenrollment, payment and remittance advice, plan premium payments, and coordination of benefits.
Standards for the security of electronic health information require us to implement various administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of electronic protected health information.
We maintain a HIPAA committee that is charged with evaluating and monitoring our compliance with HIPAA. The HIPAA committee monitors regulations promulgated under HIPAA as they have been adopted to date and as additional standards and modifications are adopted. Although health information standards have had a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health data and communicate with payors, the cost of our compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We cannot estimate the cost of compliance with standards that have not been issued or finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services.
In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur. Although our policies and procedures are aimed at complying with privacy and security requirements and minimizing the risks of any breach of privacy or security, there can be no assurance that a breach of privacy or security will not occur. If there is a breach, we may be subject to various penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.
Compliance Program
Our Compliance Program
We maintain a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) that provides guidelines for principles and regulatory rules that are applicable to our patient care and business activities. The Code of Conduct is reviewed and amended as necessary and is the basis for our company-wide compliance program. These guidelines are implemented by our compliance officer, our compliance and audit committee, and are communicated to our employees through education and training. We also have established a reporting system, auditing and monitoring programs, and a disciplinary system as a means for enforcing the Code of Conduct’s policies.
Compliance and Audit Committee
Our compliance and audit committee is made up of members of our senior management and in-house counsel. The compliance and audit committee meets, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis and reviews the activities, reports, and operation of our compliance program. In addition, our HIPAA committee provides reports to the compliance and audit committee. Our vice president of compliance and audit services meets with the compliance and audit committee, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis to provide an overview of the activities and operation of our compliance program.
Operating Our Compliance Program
We focus on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends upon individual employee actions as well as company operations. As a result, we have adopted an operations team approach to compliance. Our corporate executives, with the assistance of corporate experts, designed the programs of the compliance and audit committee. We utilize facility leaders for employee-level implementation of our Code of Conduct. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business.
Compliance Issue Reporting
In order to facilitate our employees’ ability to report known, suspected, or potential violations of our Code of Conduct, we have developed a system of reporting. This reporting, anonymous or attributable, may be accomplished through our toll-free compliance hotline, compliance e-mail address, or our compliance post office box. Our compliance officer and the compliance and audit committee are responsible for reviewing and investigating each compliance incident in accordance with the compliance and audit services department’s investigation policy.
Compliance Monitoring and Auditing / Comprehensive Training and Education
Monitoring reports and the results of compliance for each of our business segments are reported to the compliance and audit committee, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We train and educate our employees regarding the Code of Conduct, as well as the legal and regulatory requirements relevant to each employee’s work environment. New and current employees are required to acknowledge and certify that the employee has read, understood, and has agreed to abide by the Code of Conduct. Additionally, all employees are required to re-certify compliance with the Code of Conduct on an annual basis.
Policies and Procedures Reflecting Compliance Focus Areas
We review our policies and procedures for our compliance program from time to time in order to improve operations and to ensure compliance with requirements of standards, laws, and regulations and to reflect the ongoing compliance focus areas which have been identified by the compliance and audit committee.
Internal Audit
We have a compliance and audit department, which has an internal audit function. Our vice president of compliance and audit services manages the combined compliance and audit department and meets with the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis to discuss audit results and provide an overview of the activities and operation of our compliance program.
