ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Organization
 
Global Medical REIT Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was formed in 2011, re domiciled as a Maryland corporation in 2014, and is engaged primarily in the acquisition of purpose-built healthcare facilities and leasing of those properties to strong healthcare systems and physician groups with leading market share. We are externally managed and advised by our Advisor. See “—Our Advisor and our Management Agreement” for a description of our Advisor and the terms of our management agreement.
 
We hold our facilities and conduct our operations through a Delaware limited partnership subsidiary named Global Medical REIT L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). We, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, serve as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2018, we were the 87.42% limited partner of the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 12.58% owned by holders of long-term incentive plan units granted under our equity compensation plan (“LTIP Units”) and third-party limited partners who contributed properties or services to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership units (“OP Units”).
 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Prior to the end of the calendar quarter occurring immediately after the date in which our stockholders’ equity (as defined in our management agreement) exceeds $500 million, we have agreed with our Advisor that our board of directors will establish a special committee of independent directors to discuss with our Advisor whether it would be in our stockholders’ best interest to internalize management. See “—Agreement to Evaluate Internalization” for a more detailed description of our agreement to evaluate an internalization transaction.
 
Business Overview
 
We believe that the aging of America and the decentralization of healthcare services are increasing the need for purpose-built healthcare facilities operated by strong practice groups and healthcare systems. Accordingly, we seek to invest in medical office buildings, specialty hospitals, and in-patient rehabilitation facilities to align our portfolio with contemporary trends in the delivery of healthcare services. We target well-operated properties in secondary and tertiary markets with strong demographic trends. 
 
Our healthcare facilities are typically leased under long-term, triple-net leases. Most of our tenants are physician groups, regional or national healthcare systems, community hospitals and combinations thereof.
 
Our Business Objectives and Investment Strategy
 
Our principal business objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a combination of (i) reliable dividends and (ii) potential long-term capital appreciation. Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to:

· | construct a property portfolio that consists substantially of medical office buildings (MOBs), specialty hospitals, in-patient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), that are situated to take advantage of the aging of the U.S. population and the decentralization of healthcare;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | focus on practice types that will be utilized by an aging population and are highly dependent on their purpose-built real estate to deliver core medical procedures, such as cardiovascular treatment, rehabilitation, eye surgery, gastroenterology, oncology treatment and orthopedics; 
· | set aside a portion of our property portfolio for opportunistic acquisitions, including certain acute-care hospitals and long-term acute care facilities (LTACs), that we believe provide premium, risk-adjusted returns; 
· | lease our facilities under long-term, triple-net leases with contractual annual rent escalations; 
· | lease each facility to medical providers with a track record of successfully managing excellent clinical and profitable practices; and 
· | receive credit protections from our tenants or their affiliates, including personal and corporate guaranties, rent reserves and rent coverage requirements.

Ground Leases
 
As of December 31, 2018, we leased the land upon which three of our facilities are built, representing approximately 4% of our total rentable square feet and approximately 6% of our December 2018 annualized base rent. The ground leases subject these properties to certain restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to re-let such facilities to tenants not affiliated with the healthcare delivery system that owns the underlying land, rights of first offer and refusal with respect to sales of the facilities and restrictions that limit the types of medical procedures that may be performed at the facilities.

We are currently in the due diligence period for the East Valley transaction. If we identify problems with the property or the operator of the property during our due diligence review, we may not close the transaction on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase agreement and not close the transaction.
 
Healthcare Industry and Healthcare Real Estate Market Opportunity
 
We believe the U.S. healthcare industry is continuing its rapid pace of growth due to increasing healthcare expenditures, favorable demographic trends, evolving patient preferences and evolving government initiatives. Furthermore, we believe these factors are contributing to the increasing need for healthcare providers to enhance the delivery of healthcare by, among other things, integrating real estate solutions that frees up capital for reinvestment in their practices and allows healthcare providers to focus on providing healthcare services and not real estate management.
U.S. Healthcare Spending Expected to Increase 5.5% per Year Over Next Decade
 
According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, healthcare spending grew by 3.9% in 2017 to $3.5 trillion, or approximately 17.9% of U.S. gross domestic product and is expected to increase 5.5% per year over the next decade. The anticipated continuing increase in demand for healthcare services, together with an evolving complex and costly regulatory environment, changes in medical technology and reductions in government reimbursements, are expected to pressure capital-constrained healthcare providers to find cost effective solutions for their real estate needs. We believe the demand for healthcare facilities by healthcare providers will increase as health spending in the United States continues to increase, which will increase the potential supply of healthcare facilities in the market.
Aging U.S. Population Driving Increase in Demand for Healthcare Services
 
The general aging of the population, driven by the baby boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services which increase life expectancy, is a key driver of the growth in healthcare expenditures. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the segment of the population consisting of people 65 years or older comprise the fastest growing segment of the overall U.S. population. We believe that demographic trends in the United States, including, in particular, an aging population, will result in continued growth in the demand for healthcare services utilized by an aging population, which in turn will lead to an increasing need for a greater supply of specialized, well-located healthcare facilities.
Clinical Care Continues to Shift Away from Large, Centralized Facilities
 
We believe the continued shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from large, centralized facilities to smaller, more specialized facilities will increase the need for smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals and outpatient facilities that take advantage of these shifting trends. Procedures traditionally performed in large, general hospitals, such as certain types of surgeries, are increasingly moving to more conveniently-located, specialized facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals and lower costs in the non-hospital environment.

-

 

We believe that healthcare is delivered more cost effectively and with higher patient satisfaction when it is provided outside of a large, centralized hospital environment. Increased specialization within the medical field is also driving demand for medical facilities that are purpose-built for particular specialties.
 
Opportunistic Acquisitions in Acute-Care Facilities 
 
 Despite the continued shift in the delivery of healthcare services to smaller, more specialized facilities, we believe opportunities exist to acquire larger, acute-care facilities, such as acute-care hospitals and LTACs, with very attractive submarket fundamentals at compelling valuations and strong EBITDAR coverage.  Despite the trends away from acute-care facilities, we believe that certain, well-located acute-care hospitals and LTACs will still be critical components of the U.S. healthcare system.  Although not the primary focus of our investment strategy, we believe allocating a portion of our portfolio for opportunistic, acute-care facilities acquisitions helps diversify our portfolio and is consistent with our strategy of aligning ourselves with strong operators.
  
Our Advisor and our Management Agreement
 
We are externally managed and advised by our Advisor pursuant to a management agreement, subject to the oversight of our board of directors. Our Advisor provides substantially all of the services related to the operation of our company and business, including services related to the location, selection, acquisition and financing of healthcare facilities, the collection of rents, the payment of dividends, the preparation of reports to our investors, and the disposition of healthcare facilities. Pursuant to the management agreement, we are the only investment vehicle our Advisor can manage that focuses on our asset classes. Each of our officers is an employee of our Advisor.
 
ZH International is the 85% owner of our Advisor and the owner of ZH USA, LLC, which held approximately 14% of our common stock as of December 31, 2018, which we believe aligns the Advisor’s interests with those of our stockholders. A public company traded on the Hong Kong exchange, ZH International is engaged in global real estate development, investment, management and sales and REIT management. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Jeffrey Busch, owns the remaining 15% of our Advisor.
 
The terms of the management agreement, including the fee arrangements, expense provisions and termination fee provisions, are summarized below.
 

Type | Description 
--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base Management Fee | 1.5% of our stockholders’ equity per annum, calculated quarterly for the most recently completed fiscal quarter and payable in quarterly installments in arrears in cash. 
 | For purposes of calculating the base management fee, our stockholders’ equity means: (a) the sum of (1) our stockholders’ equity as of March 31, 2016, (2) the aggregate amount of the conversion price (including interest) for the conversion of our outstanding convertible debentures into our common stock as of the completion of our initial public offering and (3) the net proceeds from (or equity value assigned to) all issuances of our equity and equity equivalent securities (including common stock, common stock equivalents, preferred stock, LTIP Units and OP Units issued by us or our Operating Partnership) (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), less (b) any amount that we pay to repurchase shares of our common stock or equity securities of our Operating Partnership. Our stockholders’ equity also excludes (1) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization) that have impacted stockholders’ equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and (2) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between our Advisor and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders’ equity, for purposes of calculating the base management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders’ equity shown on our financial statements.

-


Incentive Fee | An incentive fee payable with respect to each calendar quarter (or part thereof that the management agreement is in effect) in arrears. The incentive fee will be an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20% and (y) the difference between (i) our AFFO (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period, and (ii) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price of equity securities offerings and transactions of the Company and the Operating Partnership, multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock, OP Units, LTIP Unit awards and shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the Global Medical REIT Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Equity Incentive Plan”) or any future plan in the previous 12-month period, and (B) 8%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to our Advisor with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless AFFO is greater than zero for the four most recently completed calendar quarters.
----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | AFFO is calculated by adjusting our funds from operations, or FFO, by adding back acquisition and disposition costs, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of deferred financing costs and any other non-recurring or non-cash expenses, which are costs that do not relate to the operating performance of our properties, and subtracting loss on extinguishment of debt, straight line rent adjustment, recurring tenant improvements, recurring leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures. 
Expense Reimbursement | We are required to reimburse our Advisor for operating expenses related to us that are incurred by our Advisor, including expenses relating to legal, accounting, due diligence and other services. Except with respect to a portion of our General Counsel and Secretary’s compensation, which arrangement ceased in May 2018, we do not reimburse any compensation expenses incurred by the Advisor. Our reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation. Expenses are reimbursed in cash on a quarterly basis. 
Termination Fee | Upon any termination of the management agreement by us, other than for cause, any non-renewal of the management agreement by us or any termination of the management agreement by our Advisor due to our material breach of the management agreement, our Advisor will be paid a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and the average annual incentive fee with respect to the previous eight fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter prior to termination. 

 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid aggregate base management fees to our Advisor of $4.3 million and did not pay any incentive fees. Additionally, except for the base management fee and incentive fee, we do not pay any additional fees to our Advisor, which we believe distinguishes us from other externally-managed REITs that may charge other fees in addition to base management and incentive fees, such as acquisition fees and financing fees. Furthermore, as stated above, an affiliate of our Advisor owned approximately 14% of our common stock as of December 31, 2018, which we believe aligns the interest of our Advisor and our stockholders.
 
We believe our externally-managed structure has been indispensable to us during the early stages of our business as our Advisor has provided us with an operational infrastructure on a cost-effective basis. However, as we continue to grow our equity base, it may become more cost effective to internalize our management or modify the terms of our management agreement with our Advisor.
 
Agreement to Evaluate Internalization
 
Prior to the end of the calendar quarter occurring immediately after the date in which our stockholders’ equity (as defined in our management agreement) exceeds $500 million, we have agreed with our Advisor that our board of directors will establish a special committee of independent directors to discuss with our Advisor whether it would be in our stockholders’ best interest to internalize management. If we elect to internalize management as a result of such discussions, we would expect to terminate the management agreement with our Advisor and hire certain employees of our Advisor while also potentially entering into other service agreements with our Advisor that would allow us to continue to utilize certain personnel and resources of our Advisor that would not be acquired by us in the internalization transaction. It is also possible that, as a result of such discussions between us and our Advisor, we may elect to preserve our external management structure but with modifications to the terms of the management agreement between us and our Advisor that, among other things, alter our expenses to mirror more closely what our expenses would be if we were internally managed.

To complete an internalization transaction, the special committee of our board and our Advisor would need to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable agreement relating to such transaction. We cannot assure you that such negotiations will result in a mutually acceptable agreement, that we will be able to complete any such a transaction, or on what terms it may be completed, including the amount of consideration we may be required to pay to our Advisor. In addition, to the extent required under the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange or other exchange upon which our shares of common stock are then listed, any such transaction may require the approval of our stockholders. Consequently, no assurance can be given that an agreement will be reached or that internalization of our Advisor will be achieved.
 
Qualification as a REIT
 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. Subject to a number of significant exceptions, a corporation that qualifies as a REIT generally is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders, thereby reducing its corporate-level taxes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a substantial percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a substantial percentage of our income must be rental revenue from real property or interest on mortgage loans. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
 
Competition
 
We compete with many other real estate investors for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including healthcare operators, and real estate investors such as private equity firms and other REITs, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The competition for healthcare properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for healthcare properties, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
 
Additionally, our healthcare facilities and tenants often face competition from nearby hospitals, other medical practices and other healthcare facilities, including urgent care and other primary care facilities, that provide comparable services. If our tenants’ competitors have greater geographic coverage, improved access and convenience to physicians and patients, provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services, recruit physicians to provide competing services at their facilities, expand or improve their services or obtain more favorable managed-care contracts, our tenants may not be able to successfully compete.
 
Government Laws and Regulation
 
Affordable Care Act
 
 The Affordable Care Act is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that contains various provisions that may directly impact our tenants.  The primary goal of the Affordable Care Act is to broaden insurance coverage for the uninsured population by expanding Medicaid coverage, creating health insurance exchanges and mandating that uninsured individuals purchase health insurance. The Affordable Care Act also contains provisions aimed at lowering the cost of healthcare, including lowering increases in Medicare payment rates and promoting alternate reimbursement methods for providers that focus on patient outcomes rather than volume. In addition to expanding coverage and controlling costs, the Affordable Care Act also contains provisions intended to combat healthcare fraud, including Medicare fraud and abuse. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid and allowed states not to participate in the expansion without losing their existing Medicaid funding. 
    Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the Affordable Care Act. Although there continue to be judicial challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court has thus far upheld the Affordable Care Act, including, most recently, in their June 25, 2015 ruling on King v. Burwell. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order aimed at seeking the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. In addition, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA. The TCJA repealed the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act starting in 2019. Also, on December 14, 2018, in Texas v. Azar, the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas invalidated the Affordable Care Act based on the removal of the individual mandate provision by the TCJA, although the decision has been stayed pending appeal. We cannot predict whether any future attempts to amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act will be successful or that the decision in Texas v. Azar will be overturned or confirmed on appeal. We cannot predict whether any future attempts to amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act will be successful. The future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain and any changes to existing laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act’s repeal, modification or replacement, could have a long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare. Both our tenants and us may be adversely affected by the law or its repeal, modification or replacement.

Although the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of insurance coverage may benefit our tenants by increasing their number of insured patients, these benefits may be offset by the fact that (i) many of the newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are insured by policies that have high deductibles (and, thus, create higher patient credit risks for our tenants), (ii) some states have not implemented the Medicaid expansion or have Implemented Medicaid expension in such ways that may reduce potential enrollment (such as and Implementing work requirements), (iii) if they have, Medicaid may not be accepted by some of our tenants. For our tenants that do accept Medicaid, they may receive lower reimbursements for Medicaid patients than for patients with Medicare or commercial insurance. Additionally, although the migration from Medicare fee-for-service, or volume-based, payments to an outcome-based reimbursement model may lower overall healthcare costs, these changes could negatively affect our tenants if they are unable to adapt to a more outcome-oriented healthcare delivery model.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Programs
 
Sources of revenue for our tenants typically include the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Healthcare providers continue to face increased government pressure to control or reduce healthcare costs and significant reductions in healthcare reimbursement, including reduced reimbursements and changes to payment methodologies under the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, private insurers rely on all or portions of the Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from private insurers.
 
If the United States economy enters a recession or slower growth, this could negatively affect state budgets, thereby putting pressure on states to decrease spending on Medicaid. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in Medicaid programs due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Historically, states have often attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. Additionally, in early 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued guidance that would allow states to impose work requirements as a condition to Medicaid eligibility, which could dampen enrollment in the program.
 
Efforts by Medicare and Medicaid to reduce reimbursements will likely continue, which could negatively affect our tenant’s revenues and their ability to pay rent to us.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from, or are in a position to make referrals in connection with, government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our leases with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. These laws include without limitation:

· | The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of any U.S. federal or state healthcare program patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (commonly called the “Stark Law”), which, subject to specific exceptions, restricts physicians who have financial relationships with healthcare providers from making referrals for designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a financial relationship;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, including under the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to impose monetary penalties for certain fraudulent acts; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | State anti-kickback, anti-inducement, anti-referral and insurance fraud laws which may be generally similar to, and potentially more expansive than, the federal laws set forth above.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Violations of these laws may result in criminal and/or civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act clarifies that the submission of claims for items or services generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. The federal government has taken the position, and some courts have held, that violations of other laws, such as the Stark Law, can also be a violation of the False Claims Act. Additionally, certain laws, such as the False Claims Act, allow for individuals to bring whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations thereof. Imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants could jeopardize that tenant’s ability to operate or to make rent payments to us. Further, we enter into leases and other financial relationships with healthcare delivery systems that are subject to or impacted by these laws. In the future we may have other investors who are healthcare providers in certain of our subsidiaries that own our healthcare facilities. If any of our relationships, including those related to the other investors in our subsidiaries, are found not to comply with these laws, we and our physician investors may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.

Other Regulations
 
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities. Our tenants generally will be subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, and certification for participation in government programs, billing for services, privacy and security of health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provides for the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information, and relationships with physicians and other referral sources. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial condition and the financial condition of our tenants. These changes, in some cases, could apply retroactively. The enactment, timing or effect of legislative or regulatory changes cannot be predicted.
 
Many states regulate the construction of healthcare facilities, the expansion of healthcare facilities, the construction or expansion of certain services, including by way of example specific bed types and medical equipment, as well as certain capital expenditures through certificate of need, or CON, laws. Under such laws, the applicable state regulatory body must determine a need exists for a project before the project can be undertaken. If one of our tenants seeks to undertake a CON-regulated project, but is not authorized by the applicable regulatory body to proceed with the project, the tenants would be prevented from operating in its intended manner.
 
 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us directly and our tenants ability to make rent payments to us.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and prior owners and tenants of real estate may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating, remediating and monitoring certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such healthcare facility. In addition to these costs, the past or present owner or tenant of a healthcare facility from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injury or property damage that results from such releases, including for the unauthorized release of asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous substances into the air, as well as any damages to natural resources or the environment that arise from such releases. These environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the current or prior owner or tenant knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such substances or materials. Moreover, the release of hazardous substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances or materials, may adversely affect the owner’s or tenant’s ability to lease, sell, develop or rent such healthcare facility or to borrow by using such healthcare facility as collateral. Persons who transport or arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, regardless of whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person.
 
Certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and tenants of real property with respect to the management of hazardous substances and other regulated materials. For example, environmental laws govern the management and removal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.
 
Employees
 
The Company is externally managed by the Advisor and, therefore, has no employees. The Advisor provides the services of the officers and other management personnel of the Company.
