Recent Highlights

• | As of February 2019, commercial production of EXPAREL is now underway at a custom suite in Swindon, England, created under our partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific Pharma Services (formerly Patheon UK Limited), or Thermo Fisher. This first suite mirrors our existing facility at the Pacira Science Center Campus in San Diego, California, and is expected to double our manufacturing capacity. Through the partnership, we are developing a second dedicated suite that is expected to enable another doubling of EXPAREL manufacturing capacity in approximately two years. Our investment in this facility is an integral component of our strategy to meet the growing customer demand in the U.S. and to support expansion into new global markets, such as Europe, Canada and Asia.


• | On February 7, 2019, we received FDA approval for our sNDA to extend the shelf life of EXPAREL from 12 months to 24 months.


• | In January 2019, we announced that our Phase 4 study of EXPAREL in patients undergoing Cesarean section, or C-section, achieved its primary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in total postsurgical opioid consumption through 72 hours (p<0.05). EXPAREL also achieved statistical significance for reduction in pain intensity scores through 72 hours (p<0.05). The full study results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed medical literature.

EXPAREL was approved by the FDA in October 2011 and was commercially launched in April 2012. EXPAREL is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve blocks. EXPAREL consists of bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, encapsulated in DepoFoam, our proprietary extended release drug delivery technology, that delivers bupivacaine over time for extended analgesia. We believe that EXPAREL addresses a significant medical need for a long-acting non-opioid postsurgical analgesic and plays a significant role in opioid minimization strategies. EXPAREL is designed for recovery with minimal opioid use by (i) delivering targeted local analgesia at the surgical site; (ii) reliably releasing bupivacaine over time for prolonged analgesia; (iii) eliminating the need for catheters and pumps that may hinder recovery and (iv) providing long-lasting pain control while reducing the need for opioids. Our net product sales of EXPAREL in 2018 were $331.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, net product sales of EXPAREL accounted for 98%, 99% and 96% of our total revenues, respectively. In addition to EXPAREL, DepoFoam is also the basis for future clinical candidates.
Our current product portfolio and product candidate pipeline, along with anticipated milestones over the next 12 to 18 months, are summarized in the table below:

Our Strategy
We continue to drive forward on our goal to be a global leader in delivering innovative non-opioid pain management and regenerative health solutions. To achieve this, we are advancing a three-pronged strategy: 

• | Maximizing the EXPAREL opportunity: As the only opioid-free, long-acting local and regional analgesic approved for infiltration, field blocks and interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, we believe EXPAREL is well-positioned to continue delivering strong sustainable growth from multiple sources. We are focusing on expanding the use of EXPAREL in key surgical settings, such as spine, hip fracture and C-section. We are also seeing increased use within the anesthesiology community after the FDA’s approval of our sNDA to include administration via interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia for upper extremity procedures. In addition, we are advancing clinical and regulatory activities to support the approval of EXPAREL in the pediatric setting, as well as in new target markets.


• | Leveraging our proprietary DepoFoam platform for new clinical candidates: We are developing a pipeline based on our DepoFoam platform, our established safe and effective multivesicular liposomal drug delivery technology. DepoFoam consists of microscopic, spherical, lipid-based particles composed of a honeycomb of numerous, non-concentric, internal aqueous chambers containing the encapsulated drug. DepoFoam provides flexible delivery and can be designed to offer an immediate release dose followed by sustained delivery. We are defining a development program for the intrathecal delivery of a non-opioid analgesic for acute and chronic pain, and we are awaiting readouts from animal and other feasibility studies for additional DepoFoam-based clinical candidates. 


• | Pursuing innovative acquisition targets that align with our strategy: We believe EXPAREL and the DepoFoam platform offer a strong foundation to address the opioid epidemic. Building on these company assets, we are also pursuing innovative acquisition targets ranging from devices, therapeutics, cell therapies, and regenerative medicines. Our goal is to build a portfolio of customer-focused non-opioid solutions to improve patients’ journeys along the neural pain pathway.

EXPAREL
Opioid addiction in the U.S. has reached epidemic proportions, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that 91 people die every day from an opioid overdose. Overreliance on opioids in the postsurgical setting has caused a rapid deluge of opioid misuse, abuse and addiction. In 2018, new research showed that patients received nearly 100 to 200 opioid pills to help manage pain from four common procedures ranging from rotator cuff repair and hip replacement to knee replacement and sleeve gastrectomy. Further, one-quarter of orthopedic surgery patients were prescribed a daily dose of opioids equal to 90 milligrams of morphine or more, which are doses so potent that the CDC says they put patients at high risk for overdose. The report shows that across the seven orthopedic and soft tissue surgical procedures examined, patients were prescribed an average of 82 opioid pills each to help manage postsurgical pain. The research indicates that close to nine percent of surgical patients became newly persistent users in 2017, continuing to take these opioids at least three to six months after their procedure. Among patients having knee replacement surgery or a colectomy, newly persistent opioid users climbed as high as 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Further, women were 40 percent more likely to become persistent opioid users than men; and among persistent users, females were prescribed 15 percent more opioids than their male counterparts. These findings come from the report, Exposing a Silent Gateway to Persistent Opioid Use - A Choices Matter Status Report, based on an analysis of 2017 adjudicated medical and pharmacy claims data conducted by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science and a nationwide survey of surgical patients and surgeons fielded in 2018 by Wakefield Research.
Based on our clinical data, EXPAREL provides continuous and extended postsurgical analgesia and reduces the consumption of opioid medications. We believe EXPAREL simplifies postsurgical pain management, minimizes breakthrough episodes of pain and has the potential to result in improved patient care and outcomes, as well as enhanced hospital economics.
Our EXPAREL growth strategy is summarized below:

• | First, expanding the use of EXPAREL in key surgical settings. In April 2018, the FDA approved our sNDA to broaden the use of EXPAREL to include administration via interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve blocks. With this approval, EXPAREL is the first long-acting, single-dose nerve block available for patients undergoing upper extremity surgeries, such as total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair. We have published positive results from a Phase 4 multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, and we recently reported positive topline results from our Phase 4 study of EXPAREL in patients undergoing C-section procedures. Our Phase 4 plan also includes a

4

follow-on study in C-section procedures, which will include an opioid-free arm, as well as studies in hip fracture and spine surgeries. We are also seeing EXPAREL incorporated into an increasing number of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, or ERAS, protocols from major academic centers for a wide range of procedures. In addition, we are advancing clinical and regulatory activities to support the future expansion of EXPAREL to the pediatric setting, as well as new global markets, such as Europe, Canada and China.

• | Second, expanding access to EXPAREL and driving education and awareness around the need for opioid-sparing strategies. We continue to advance our Choices Matter national educational campaign, aimed at empowering patients to proactively discuss postsurgical pain management, including non-opioid options, with their doctors. We also have a focused team in the field consisting of outpatient account managers who are working with ambulatory centers and commercial payers to facilitate EXPAREL reimbursement and support the transition of procedures commonly thought of as inpatient to the ambulatory setting. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is now providing Medicare reimbursement for EXPAREL when administered in Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) through the product-specific Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code of C9290, which became effective January 1, 2019 (also known as a C-code). We believe having a product-specific reimbursement code for EXPAREL will support a more efficient reimbursement process as commercial payers standardize around Medicare rates and practices. In addition, a Current Dental Terminology (CDT) code became effective on January 1, 2019 (also known as a D-code) to report infiltration of a sustained-release therapeutic drug in oral surgery procedures. We believe the D-code will meaningfully enhance the use of non-opioid options in oral surgery procedures, where young adult patients are often exposed to an opioid for the first time.


• | Third, partnering with those who share our commitment to innovative opioid-sparing procedural solutions. We have a growing network of strategic collaborations to expand education on the importance of non-opioid multimodal alternatives for post-surgical pain management and broaden our commercial reach. These include agreements with industry partners, as well as healthcare providers and hospital systems to support their implementation of opioid-sparing enhanced recovery protocols. In January 2017, we formed a partnership with DePuy Synthes Sales Inc., or DePuy Synthes, part of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies, to support the promotion, education and training of EXPAREL in orthopedics. Our growing coalition of collaborators also includes Aetna, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, or AAOMS, the American College of Surgeons, the American Society for Enhanced Recovery, Cancer Treatment Centers of America, the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative, MEDNAX, WellStar Health System and Shatterproof.org.

EXPAREL Clinical Benefits
We believe EXPAREL can replace the use of bupivacaine via elastomeric pumps as the foundation of a multimodal regimen for long-acting postsurgical pain management. Based on our clinical data, EXPAREL:    

• | provides long-lasting local or regional analgesia;


• | is a ready-to-use formulation;


• | expands easily with saline or lactated Ringer’s to reach a desired volume;


• | leverages existing interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, field block and infiltration administration techniques; and


• | facilitates treatment of both small and large surgical sites.

We believe EXPAREL can become the foundation of a long-acting postsurgical pain management regimen to reduce the need for opioids. Based on the clinical data from our Phase 3 hemorrhoidectomy trial, our Phase 3 interscalene brachial plexus nerve block trial, our Phase 4 TKA trial, as well as our retrospective health outcomes studies data, EXPAREL significantly reduces opioid usage while improving postsurgical pain management.
In our Phase 3 hemorrhoidectomy trial, EXPAREL:

• | delayed the median time to rescue analgesic use (opioids) to 15 hours for patients treated with EXPAREL versus one hour for patients treated with placebo;

5


• | significantly increased the percentage of patients requiring no opioid rescue medication through 72 hours post-surgery to 28%, compared to 10% for placebo;


• | resulted in 45% less opioid usage through 72 hours post-surgery compared to placebo; and


• | increased the percentage of patients who were pain free at 24 hours post-surgery compared to placebo.

In our Phase 3 trial as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block for upper extremity surgeries, EXPAREL:

• | decreased total opioid consumption by 78 percent (p<0.0001) from zero to 48 hours after surgery;


• | reduced pain scores by 46 percent versus placebo (P<0.0001); and


• | 13 percent of patients who received EXPAREL did not require any opioids for 48 hours after surgery (p<0.01).

In our Phase 4 trial of EXPAREL versus bupivacaine HCl in TKA, EXPAREL:

• | decreased total opioid consumption by 78 percent (p=0.0048) from zero to 48 hours after surgery;


• | reduced pain scores by 14 percent (p=0.0381) from 12 to 48 hours after surgery; and


• | 10 percent of patients in the EXPAREL arm remained opioid-free through 48 and 72 hours (compared to zero patients in the bupivacaine arm; p<0.01).

EXPAREL can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes. We believe EXPAREL:

• | provides effective pain control without the need for expensive and difficult-to-use delivery technologies that extend the duration of action for bupivacaine, such as elastomeric bags, or opioids administered through patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, when used as part of a multimodal postsurgical pain regimen;


• | reduces the need for patients to be constrained by elastomeric bags and PCA systems, which are barriers to earlier ambulation and may introduce catheter-related issues, including infection; and


• | promotes maintenance of early postsurgical pain management, which may reduce the time spent in the intensive care unit.

EXPAREL Health Economic Benefits
In addition to being efficacious and safe, we believe that EXPAREL provides health economic benefits that play an important role in formulary decision-making that are often overlooked. Several members of our management team have extensive experience applying health economic outcomes research to support commercial success. Our strategy is to work directly with the senior leadership of our hospital customers, integrated health networks, quality improvement organizations, key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in the field of postsurgical pain management and leading influencer hospitals to provide them with retrospective and prospective studies to demonstrate the economic benefits of EXPAREL.
Our national, regional and local analyses assessing retrospective health economic outcomes, conducted in conjunction with hospital customer groups utilizing their own hospital databases, revealed that the use of opioids for postsurgical pain control is a significant driver of hospital resource consumption, including higher hospitalization costs, longer length of stay, or LOS, and the potential for opioid-related adverse events.
In November 2018, new data was published by the Journal of Medical Economics on the use of EXPAREL to manage postsurgical pain following TKA. The study showed that patients receiving EXPAREL had a significant reduction in opioid use, hospital LOS and total hospitalization costs compared to TKA patients who did not receive EXPAREL. Patients receiving EXPAREL also had an increased likelihood to be discharged home rather than to a skilled nursing facility.
This retrospective analysis utilized hospital chargemaster data from the Premier Healthcare Database from January 2011 through April 2017 for the 10 hospitals in the U.S. with the highest number of primary TKA procedures using EXPAREL. Patients undergoing TKA who received EXPAREL were matched in a one-to-one ratio to a control group of patients whose pain 
6

management strategy did not include EXPAREL. The study population included 20,907 Medicare-insured TKA patients and 12,505 TKA patients with commercial insurance.
Results showed that patients undergoing TKA who received EXPAREL demonstrated a significant:

• | Decrease in opioid consumption, expressed in oral morphine equivalent dosing (MED), when controlled for LOS in both the Medicare and commercial insurance groups (69 mg MED and 64 MED reductions, respectively; P<0.0001);

•Decrease in average hospital LOS by 0.6 days in both the Medicare and commercial insurance groups (P<0.0001);

• | Decrease in total hospitalization costs in both the Medicare and commercial insurance groups (-$616 and -$775, respectively; P<0.0001); and


• | An increase in likelihood to be discharged home in both the Medicare and commercial insurance groups (1.58 times more likely and 1.63 times more likely, respectively; P<0.0001).

Approximately 700,000 TKA procedures were performed in the United States in 2012, making it one of the most common hospital-based surgical procedures in the country. The number of annual TKA procedures is estimated to reach 3.5 million by 2030. Additionally, total Medicare hospital reimbursement for inpatient TKA and total hip arthroplasty (collectively known as total joint arthroplasty, or TJA) was $6.6 billion in 2013 and is likely to continue rising with the projected increases in TJA procedures.
Third Molar Procedures
In September 2017, we announced a collaboration with Aetna, one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits companies, with the support of AAOMS. This national program aims to reduce the number of opioid tablets dispensed to patients undergoing impacted third molar (wisdom tooth) extractions by at least 50 percent through the utilization of EXPAREL to provide prolonged non-opioid postsurgical pain control. Aetna now includes the cost of EXPAREL as a covered expense for impacted third molar extractions performed by surgeons who have completed training on use of the product.
According to a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) study, more than two-thirds of patients who underwent surgical tooth extractions reported unused prescription opioids, with the majority also indicating that these medications are neither safely stored nor disposed of. These facts suggest that there is a dangerous accumulation of opioids in the home, which are available for potential diversion or misuse.
EXPAREL Dosing, Volume Expansion and Admixing with Bupivacaine HCl
EXPAREL is available as a 266 mg/20 mL single-use vial and a 133 mg/10 mL single-use vial. The recommended dose of EXPAREL is based on (i) the size of the surgical site; (ii) the volume needed to cover the width and depth of the surgical site and (iii) patient-specific factors that could impact safety of an amide-type local anesthetic. The maximum dose should not exceed 266 mg.
EXPAREL can be expanded in volume to optimize results. Physicians consider the size of the surgical site and neuroanatomy to determine dosing and volume expansion. The 266 mg (20 mL) EXPAREL vial can be expanded with up to 280 mL of normal (0.9%) saline or lactated Ringer’s solution for a total volume of 300 mL (a 1:14 ratio). For smaller surgical sites where 20 mL is too much volume, the 133 mg (10 mL) vial should be considered.
To ensure early analgesic activity, EXPAREL can be admixed with bupivacaine HCl so long as the ratio does not exceed 1:2. For example, the 266 mg/20mL vial may be administered with up to 30 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine HCl or up to 60 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine HCl. Bupivacaine HCl may be administered immediately before EXPAREL or admixed in the same syringe.
EXPAREL Label Expansion—Pediatrics
The Pediatric Research Equity Act requires pharmaceutical companies to study their products in children for the same use for which they are approved in adults. There is no long-lasting local anesthetic approved for use in children under the age of 12, meaning that pediatric patients currently have no approved alternatives to opioids for the management of severe postsurgical pain and need additional pain control options.
7

We have completed our first pharmacokinetic and safety study in children aged 12 to 17 undergoing corrective spine surgery. In addition, we have secured FDA approval of our protocol for an extended pharmacokinetic and safety study for local analgesia in children aged 6 to 17 undergoing cardiovascular or spine surgeries and site activation for this study is underway. For Pediatrics, we are seeking a broad infiltration approval, similar to that of adults under the existing EXPAREL label. We are also working with the FDA to define a program to study the administration of EXPAREL as a nerve block in the pediatric setting.
EXPAREL Global Expansion
We have defined a global expansion strategy for EXPAREL that we believe provides us with the opportunity to increase our revenue and leverage our fixed cost infrastructure. We have prioritized the European, Canadian and Chinese markets. In the E.U., we have secured a positive opinion for our Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) and we plan to submit our Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) around the middle of 2019. In Canada, which is a concentrated market driven by four provinces, we are also planning a New Drug Submission around the middle of 2019. In both the European and Canadian markets, we do not intend to pursue a commercial partnership to commercialize EXPAREL. In China, we have received feedback from the National Medical Products Administration regarding the regulatory requirements for securing approval of EXPAREL. We believe we have the clarity we need and we are in the process of finalizing our regulatory path forward. We have an agreement with Nuance Biotech Co. Ltd., a China-based specialty pharmaceutical company, for the development and commercialization of EXPAREL in China.
DepoFoam—Our Proprietary Drug Delivery Technology
Our current product development activities utilize our proprietary DepoFoam drug delivery technology. DepoFoam consists of microscopic spherical particles composed of a honeycomb-like structure of numerous internal aqueous chambers containing an active drug ingredient. Each chamber is separated from adjacent chambers by lipid membranes. Following injection, the DepoFoam particles release drug over an extended period by erosion and/or reorganization of the particles’ lipid membranes. Release rates are determined by the choice and relative amounts of lipids in the formulation.
We believe the DepoFoam formulation provides several technical, regulatory and commercial advantages over competitive technologies, including:

• | Convenience. Our DepoFoam products are ready to use, do not require reconstitution or mixing with another solution, and can be used with patient-friendly narrow gauge needles and pen systems;


• | Multiple regulatory precedents. Our current and past DepoFoam products have been approved in the U.S. and Europe, making regulatory authorities familiar with our DepoFoam technology;


• | Extensive safety history. Our DepoFoam products have nearly 20 years of safety data;


• | Proven manufacturing capabilities. We make EXPAREL, a DepoFoam-based product, in our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, facilities;


• | Flexible time release. Encapsulated drug releases over a desired period, from 1 to 30 days;


• | Favorable pharmacokinetics. Decrease in adverse events associated with high peak blood levels, thereby improving the utility of the product;


• | Shortened development timeline. Does not alter the native molecule, potentially enabling the filing of a 505(b)(2) application; and 


• | Aseptic manufacturing and filling. Enables use with proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, vaccines and small molecules.

Given the safety profile and flexibility of our DepoFoam platform, we are advancing a development plan for intrathecal delivery of a non-opioid analgesic for acute and chronic pain. This program is underway with EXPAREL, as well as other local anesthetic and novel active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) products. We also have several DepoFoam-based products in preclinical development. Following data readouts from animal and other feasibility studies for these candidates, we will determine the best programs to advance into the clinic.

Sales and Marketing
We have built our marketing and sales organization to commercialize EXPAREL and potential future commercial products. The primary target audience for EXPAREL is healthcare practitioners who influence pain management decisions including surgeons, anesthesiologists, pharmacists and nurses.
Our field team, consisting of sales representatives, outpatient account managers and scientific and medical affairs professionals, executes on a full range of activities for EXPAREL, including:

• | providing publications and abstracts showing the EXPAREL clinical program efficacy and safety, health outcomes program and review articles on pain management;


• | working in tandem with hospital staff, such as registered nurses, surgeons, heads of quality, pharmacists and executives, to provide access and resources for drug utilization or medication use evaluations and health outcomes studies, which provide retrospective and prospective analyses for our hospital customers using their own hospital data to demonstrate the true cost of opioid-based postsurgical pain control;


• | working with KOLs and advisory boards to address topics of best practice techniques as well as guidelines and protocols for the use of EXPAREL, meeting the educational and training needs of our physician, surgeon, anesthesiologist, pharmacist and registered nurse customers;


• | undertaking education initiatives such as center of excellence programs; preceptorship programs; pain protocols and predictive models for enhanced patient care; interactive discussion forums; patient education platforms leveraging public relations, advocacy partnerships and public affairs efforts where appropriate; web-based training and virtual launch programs;


• | collaborating with surgeons towards improving the knowledge and management of pain in surgical patients with a focus on opioid risk and non-opioid alternatives and engaging our field-based medical teams in system-wide partnerships to address the national opioid epidemic, with a goal of studying alternative postsurgical pain management options that focus on optimization and opioid alternative strategies; and


• | expanding our field team to include outpatient account managers to facilitate EXPAREL reimbursement and the shift of procedures to ambulatory surgery centers.

DePuy Synthes Sales Inc.
In January 2017, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with DePuy Synthes, part of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies, to market and promote the use of EXPAREL for orthopedic procedures in the U.S. market. Through this collaboration, we believe we can accelerate the EXPAREL growth strategy by quickly leveraging the broad reach of DePuy Synthes and their established relationships and scale within hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.
DePuy Synthes field representatives, specializing in joint reconstruction, spine, sports medicine and trauma, collaborate with, and supplement, our field teams by expanding the reach and frequency of EXPAREL education in the hospital surgical suite and ambulatory surgery center settings. DePuy Synthes is also including EXPAREL in their Orthopedic Episode of Care Approach for health systems and surgeons, and is including EXPAREL in all of their professional education programs. In addition to supporting orthopedic specialties, we are focusing on soft tissue surgeons in key specialties and anesthesiologists and we continue to act as the overall EXPAREL account manager. 
We will also work with DePuy Synthes to develop ERAS protocols to improve procedure-specific patient care and to then rapidly communicate opportunities to utilize EXPAREL-based multimodal pain strategies to minimize opioids and improve patient satisfaction and hospital economics. 
DePuy Synthes receives commissions on sales of EXPAREL under the agreement, subject to conditions, limitations and adjustments. The initial term of the agreement began on January 24, 2017 and ends on December 31, 2021, with the option to extend the agreement in 12-month increments upon the parties’ mutual agreement, subject to certain conditions.
We and DePuy Synthes have mutual termination rights under the agreement, subject to certain terms, conditions, and notice; provided that neither party may terminate the agreement, without cause, within three years of the effective date of the agreement. We also have additional unilateral termination rights under certain circumstances. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and confidentiality provisions, and mutual indemnification obligations. DePuy

Synthes is also subject to certain obligations and restrictions, including required compliance with certain laws and regulations and our policies, in connection with fulfilling their obligations under the agreement.
Other Agreements
TELA Bio, Inc.
In October 2017, we made an investment of $15.0 million in TELA Bio, Inc., a privately-held surgical reconstruction company that markets its proprietary OviTexTM portfolio of products for ventral hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction. OviTex Reinforced BioScaffolds (RBSs) are intended for use as a surgical mesh to reinforce and/or repair soft tissue where weakness exists.
SkyePharma Holdings, Inc. (Now a Subsidiary of Vectura Group plc)
In connection with the stock purchase agreement related to the Skyepharma Acquisition, we agreed to certain earn-out and milestone payments. Milestone payments are based on net sales of DepoBupivacaine products collected, including EXPAREL, and certain other yet-to-be-developed products. For purposes of meeting future potential milestone payments, annual net sales are measured on a rolling quarterly basis. The milestones are as follows:

• | $10.0 million upon first commercial sale in the U.S. (met April 2012);


• | $4.0 million upon first commercial sale in a major E.U. country (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain);


• | $8.0 million when annual net sales collected reach $100.0 million (met September 2014);


• | $8.0 million when annual net sales collected reach $250.0 million (met June 2016); and


• | $32.0 million when annual net sales collected reach $500.0 million.

 The earn-out payments were based on a percentage of net sales of DepoBupivacaine products collected, including EXPAREL, for the term during which such sales were covered by a valid claim in certain patent rights. The last patents during which a valid claim existed expired on September 18, 2018, and thus, the only remaining obligations to Skyepharma are the above-referenced unmet milestone payments totaling $36.0 million.
See Note 7, Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further information related to the Skyepharma agreement.

Pursuant to an agreement with the Research Development Foundation, or RDF, we are required to pay RDF a low single-digit royalty on the collection of revenues from our DepoFoam-based products for as long as certain patents assigned to us under the agreement remain valid. RDF has the right to terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by us, in connection with our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we directly or indirectly oppose or dispute the validity of the assigned patent rights.
DepoCyt(e) 
DepoCyt(e) was a sustained-release liposomal formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine that utilized our DepoFoam technology. DepoCyt(e) was indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, a life-threatening complication of lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. In June 2017, we discontinued production of DepoCyt® (U.S. and Canada) and DepoCyte® (E.U.) due to persistent technical issues specific to the DepoCyt(e) manufacturing process.
Mundipharma International Holdings Limited
In June 2003, we entered into an agreement granting Mundipharma International Holdings Limited, or Mundipharma, exclusive marketing and distribution rights to DepoCyte in the E.U. and certain other European countries. In April 2014, we amended the agreements to extend the term of the agreements by an additional 15 years to June 2033 and we expanded Mundipharma’s exclusive territory to include all countries other than the U.S., Canada and Japan. In connection with the amendments, in May 2014, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $8.0 million. Since the production of DepoCyte was discontinued in June 2017, we no longer have the ability to supply DepoCyte to Mundipharma in the future. In April 2018, we received formal notice of the termination of the supply and distribution agreements (and all related agreements) from Mundipharma and its affiliates. We may be required to make additional payments or incur additional costs relating to the DepoCyte discontinuation which could be material to our results of operations and/or cash flows in a given period.

Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.
In December 2012, we entered into an Exclusive License, Development and Commercialization Agreement and related Supply Agreement with Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., or Aratana. Under the agreements, we granted Aratana an exclusive royalty-bearing license, including the limited right to grant sublicenses, for the development and commercialization of our bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product for use in animals. In August 2016, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine approved NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) as a local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs. Aratana began purchasing bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product in 2016.
In connection with its entry into the license agreement, we received a one-time payment of $1.0 million. In December 2013, we received a $0.5 million milestone payment under the agreement. In June 2016, we recorded $1.0 million in milestone revenue for Aratana’s filing of an FDA Administrative New Animal Drug Application, or ANADA, and in August 2016 recorded $1.0 million related to the FDA’s approval of the ANADA. We are eligible to receive up to an additional aggregate $40.0 million upon the achievement of commercial milestones. Aratana is required to pay us a tiered double-digit royalty on net sales made in the U.S. If the product is approved by foreign regulatory agencies for sale outside of the U.S., Aratana will be required to pay us a tiered double-digit royalty on such net sales. Royalty rates will be reduced by a certain percentage upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications into a jurisdiction or if Aratana must pay royalties to third parties under certain circumstances.
Either party has the right to terminate the license agreement in connection with (i) an insolvency event involving the other party that is not discharged in a specified period of time; (ii) a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a specified cure period or (iii) the failure to achieve a minimum annual revenue as set forth in the agreement, all on specified notice. We may terminate the agreement in connection with (i) Aratana’s failure to pay any amounts due under the agreement; (ii) Aratana’s failure to achieve regulatory approval in a particular jurisdiction with respect to such jurisdiction or (iii) Aratana’s failure to achieve its first commercial sale within a certain amount of time on a country by country basis after receiving regulatory approval, all on specified notice. Aratana may terminate the license agreement (i) upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications on a country by country basis or (ii) at any time on a country by country basis except with respect to the U.S. and any country in the E.U., all on specified notice. The parties may also terminate the license agreement by mutual consent. The license agreement will terminate automatically if we terminate the supply agreement. In the event that the license agreement is terminated, all rights to the product (on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis) will be terminated and returned to us.
Unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the license agreement is effective until December 5, 2027, after which Aratana has the option to extend the agreement for an additional five (5) year term, subject to certain requirements.
NOCITA® is a registered trademark of Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.
Nuance Biotech Co. Ltd.
In June 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Nuance Biotech Co. Ltd., or Nuance, a China-based specialty pharmaceutical company, to advance the development and commercialization of EXPAREL in China. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to be the sole supplier of EXPAREL to Nuance and has granted Nuance the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize EXPAREL in China. The Company received an upfront payment of $3.0 million in July 2018 and is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $60.0 million that are triggered by filing for and securing regulatory approval(s) and annual sales in China exceeding certain levels. The Company is also entitled to tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales.
Significant Customers
We had three wholesalers each comprising 10% or more of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018: Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Drug Company and AmerisourceBergen Health Corporation, which accounted for 34%, 30% and 26% of our revenues, respectively. These wholesalers process orders for EXPAREL under a drop-ship program. EXPAREL is delivered directly to end-users without the wholesalers ever taking physical possession of the product.
Manufacturing and Research Facilities
Internal Facilities
We manufacture EXPAREL at our facility in San Diego, California. This facility is designated as Building 1. We also have a research and development facility, Building 2, which sits adjacent to Building 1, and a warehouse, Building 7, located within 
11

five miles of our manufacturing facilities. We refer to these three buildings as the Science Center Campus, and together these three buildings consist of approximately 150,000 square feet. Our manufacturing facilities are inspected regularly and approved for pharmaceutical manufacturing by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also have a lease for our former DepoCyt(e) production facility in San Diego which is currently idle and expires in August 2020.
We purchase raw materials and components from third-party suppliers to manufacture EXPAREL. In most instances, alternative sources of supply are available, although switching to an alternative source would, in some instances, take time and could lead to delays in manufacturing our drug candidates. While we have not experienced shortages of our raw materials in the past, such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to us at the times that we need them or on commercially reasonable terms and we do not have direct control over the availability of these raw materials from our suppliers.
All manufacturing of products, initial product release and stability testing are conducted by us in accordance with cGMP.
Building 1 is an approximately 84,000 square foot concrete structure located on a five acre site. It was custom built as a pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing facility in 1995. Activities in this facility include the manufacture of EXPAREL bulk product on dedicated production lines and its fill/finish into vials, microbiological and quality control testing, product storage, development of analytical methods and manufacturing of development products. We are expanding our EXPAREL manufacturing capacity directly and through agreements with a third-party, Thermo Fisher, as demand for EXPAREL increases, as explained below.
Building 2 is an approximately 45,000 square foot research and development lab and office building located adjacent to Building 1, built in 2003. This building houses our Science Center related general and administrative functions. The other half of the building is being used for research and development activities as it includes both laboratories and the building infrastructure necessary to support the formulation, analytical testing, clinical and process development activities for additional commercial product indications and new pipeline products. Our pilot plant suite for early-stage clinical product production is located in this building.
Building 7 is an approximately 21,000 square foot building built in 1988 that serves as the main cGMP warehouse for our San Diego operations, primarily being used for the storage of production materials. It contains ambient as well as cold temperature cGMP warehouse storage and also features a quality control clean room for sampling incoming materials.
Distribution of our DepoFoam products, including EXPAREL, requires cold-chain distribution, whereby a product must be maintained between specified temperatures. We have validated processes for continuous monitoring of temperature from manufacturing through delivery to the end-user.
Co-Production Facilities
 In April 2014, we and Thermo Fisher entered into a Strategic Co-Production Agreement, Technical Transfer and Service Agreement and Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “Thermo Fisher Agreements”) to collaborate in the manufacture of EXPAREL. Thermo Fisher undertook certain technical transfer activities and construction services needed to prepare Thermo Fisher’s Swindon, England facility for the manufacture of EXPAREL in two dedicated manufacturing suites. We provided Thermo Fisher with the equipment necessary to manufacture EXPAREL and pay fees to Thermo Fisher based on Thermo Fisher’s achievement of certain technical transfer and construction milestones. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for certain nominal expenses and additional services. In February 2019, we announced that commercial production of EXPAREL is underway at the first Thermo Fisher suite, and that we are developing a second dedicated suite that is expected to enable another doubling of EXPAREL manufacturing capacity in approximately two years.
The initial term of the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement is 10 years from the date of FDA approval of the initial manufacturing suite, which was received in May 2018. We pay fees to Thermo Fisher for their operation of the manufacturing suites and the amount of EXPAREL produced by Thermo Fisher. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for purchases made on our behalf, certain nominal expenses and additional services. We may terminate this agreement upon one month’s notice if a regulatory authority causes the withdrawal of EXPAREL from the U.S. or any other market that represents 80% of our overall sales, or at any time for convenience by providing between 18 and 36 months notice (depending on the number of years after the FDA approval date). Either party may terminate the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement in the event of the breach or bankruptcy of the other party.

Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
We seek to protect our product candidates and our technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, regulatory exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure.
Patents and Patent Applications
We seek to protect the proprietary position of our product candidates by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of December 31, 2018, there are over nine families of patents and patent applications relating to various aspects of the DepoFoam delivery technology. Patents have been issued in numerous countries, with an emphasis on the North American, European and Japanese markets. These patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of the non-provisional filing unless referring to an earlier filed application. Some of our expired U.S. patents had a term of 17 years from the grant date. Our issued patents expire at various dates in the future, as discussed below, with the last currently issued patent expiring in 2033.
We received an issue notification from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, stating that a patent relating to product-by-process and process in connection with the production of multivesicular liposomes was issued on March 7, 2017. This patent is listed on the Orange Book for EXPAREL, and includes a patent term adjustment that equates to an expiration date of December 24, 2021.
Issued patents for EXPAREL in the U.S. relating to methods for modifying the rate of drug release of the product candidate and the composition of the product candidate expired in January 2017 and September 2018, respectively. Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 156, an application for patent term extension was filed with the USPTO in October 2016 in connection with the regulatory approval of Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.’s NOCITA®. That application was subsequently withdrawn after the product-by-process patent, referenced above, was issued on March 7, 2017. In the U.S., a patent relating to the composition of the product was issued in September 2014 and expired in September 2018. A patent relating to the method of treatment using EXPAREL was issued in December 2015 and expired in September 2018. In Europe, granted patent(s) related to the composition of EXPAREL expired in September 2018. A patent relating to methods of modifying the rate of drug release of the product candidate expired in January 2018. In addition, a patent relating to the process for making the product candidate expired in November 2018.
In April 2010, a provisional patent was filed relating to a new process to manufacture EXPAREL and other DepoFoam-based products. The process offers many advantages to the current process, including larger scale production and lower manufacturing costs. In April 2011, we filed an international patent application providing the basis for several national phase patent applications, for example in Europe, China, Japan, Israel and India which, if granted, could potentially prevent others from using this process until at least 2031. In the U.S., we also filed a series of patent applications directed to the new manufacturing process. Seven of the patent applications were issued as patents as of December 2018. Patents that claim the process and apparatus will expire at the latest in November 2033. One of the patents claims a product made by the process and expires in April 2031. As of December 31, 2018, we have four granted patents in China, one granted patent in Japan and one granted patent in Israel, protecting various aspects of the new process, including the methods of using the apparatus and the apparatus itself. Furthermore, a non-exclusively licensed patent of ours relating to EXPAREL was allowed in Europe with an expiration date in October 2021 and the patent term was extended in the U.S. until October 2023.
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
Trade secrets play an important role in protecting DepoFoam-based products and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. The scale-up and commercial manufacture of DepoFoam products involves processes, custom equipment and in-process and release analytical techniques that we believe are unique to us. The expertise and knowledge required to understand the critical aspects of DepoFoam manufacturing steps requires knowledge of both traditional and non-traditional emulsion processing and traditional pharmaceutical production, overlaid with all of the challenges presented by aseptic manufacturing. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our 
13

consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than EXPAREL or any other products that we are currently selling through partners or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
EXPAREL competes with well-established products with similar indications. Competing products available for postsurgical pain management include opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, each of which is available generically from several manufacturers, and several of which are available as proprietary products using novel delivery systems. Ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, is also available generically in the U.S. from several manufacturers, and Caldolor (ibuprofen for injection), an NSAID, has been approved by the FDA for pain management and fever in adults. EXPAREL also competes with currently-marketed non-opioid products such as bupivacaine, marcaine, ropivacaine and other anesthetics/analgesics, all of which are also used in the treatment of postsurgical pain and are available as either oral tablets, injectable dosage forms or administered using novel delivery systems. Additional products may be developed for the treatment of acute pain, including new injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of currently available opioids and NSAIDs, long-acting local anesthetics and new chemical entities as well as alternative delivery forms of various opioids and NSAIDs. Currently EXPAREL also competes with elastomeric pump/catheter devices intended to provide bupivacaine over several days. I-FLOW Corporation (acquired by Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 2009 and spun off into Halyard Health, Inc. in 2014) has marketed these medical devices in the U.S. since 2004.
Government Regulation 
In the U.S., prescription drug products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, safety, efficacy, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Outside the U.S., prescription drug products are regulated by comparable agencies, laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the U.S. or elsewhere may result in, among other things, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, debarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
United States Regulatory Environment
Generally, the FDA must approve any new drug, including a new use of a previously approved drug, before marketing of the drug occurs in the U.S. This process generally involves:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations (21 CFR 58);


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin for unapproved use in the U.S.;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;

14


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;


• | completion of process validation, quality product release and stability;


• | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the product’s manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, quality and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and


• | review and approval by the FDA of the NDA.

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that the FDA will grant approvals for any of our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the trial on a clinical hold because of, among other things, concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial or about exposure of human research subjects to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Thus, submission of an IND does not by itself automatically result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. In addition, the FDA requires us to amend an existing IND for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an IRB covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial along with informed consent information for subjects before the clinical trial commences at that center. The IRB also must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time, on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register at the NIH-maintained website www.clinicaltrials.gov and report key findings and parameters. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, typically, the conduct of human clinical trials occurs in the following three pre-market sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: Sponsors initially conduct clinical trials in a limited population, either patients or healthy volunteers, to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the cases of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing often is conducted only on patients having the specific disease.


• | Phase 2: Sponsors conduct clinical trials generally in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Sponsors may conduct multiple Phase 2 clinical trials to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3: These include expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials, including pivotal clinical trials. When Phase 2 evaluations suggest the effectiveness of a dose range of the product and acceptability of such product’s safety profile, sponsors undertake Phase 3 clinical trials in larger patient populations to obtain additional information needed to evaluate the overall benefit and risk balance of the drug and to provide an adequate basis to develop labeling.

Some clinical trials may be overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move 
15

forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is likely to take a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If an application is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will review and approve the NDA. In addition, sponsors may elect to conduct, or be required by the FDA to, conduct post-approval clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after NDA approval, generate new data and best-practice administration techniques. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, sponsors submit the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In addition, 505(b)(2) applications must contain a patent certification for each patent listed in FDA’s “Orange Book” that covers the drug referenced in the application and upon which the third-party studies were conducted. For some drugs, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe the drug or where it may be dispensed or administered. Upon receipt of an NDA, the FDA has 60 days to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to initiate a substantive review. If the FDA identifies deficiencies that would preclude substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the NDA (“refuse to file”) and will inform the sponsor of the deficiencies that must be corrected prior to resubmission. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. If the FDA accepts the submission for substantive review, the FDA typically reviews the NDA in accordance with established timeframes. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA establishes goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system: Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that address an unmet medical need by offering major advances in treatment or providing a treatment where no adequate therapy currently exists. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Reviews of NDAs within 12 months of submission (ten months after the Day 60 filing date) and Priority Reviews within eight months of submission (six months after the Day 60 filing date). Review processes may sometimes extend beyond these target completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding REMS or FDA workload issues, but in general under PDUFA the FDA is supposed to complete its reviews within the target timeframes despite these factors. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to the application’s approval. The recommendations of an advisory committee do not bind the FDA, but the FDA generally follows such recommendations.
Under PDUFA, NDA applicants must pay significant NDA user fees upon submission. In addition, manufacturers of approved prescription drug products must pay annual program fees.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to ensure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. The FDA could also require a REMS plan which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may approve an NDA contingent on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials and the correction of identified manufacturing deficiencies, including the development of adequate controls and specifications. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
As an alternate path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, and permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from preclinical and/or clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA to permit the applicant to rely upon the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any change from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Applications under Section 505(b)(2) are subject to any non-patent exclusivity period applicable to the referenced product, which may delay approval of the 505(b)(2) application even if FDA has completed its substantive review and determined the drug should be approved. In addition, 505(b)(2) applications must include patent certifications to any patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book as covering the referenced product. If the 505(b)(2) applicant seeks to obtain approval before the expiration of an applicable listed patent, the 505(b)(2) applicant must provide notice to the patent owner and NDA holder of the referenced product. If the patent owner or NDA holder brings a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of such notice, the 505(b)(2) application cannot be approved for 30 months or until the 505(b)(2) applicant prevails, whichever is sooner. If the 505(b)(2) applicant loses the patent infringement suit, FDA may not approve the 505(b)(2) application until the patent expires, plus any period of pediatric exclusivity.
In the NDA submissions for our product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize the commercial opportunities for these product candidates.
Post-Approval Requirements
After approval, the NDA sponsor must comply with comprehensive requirements governing, among other things, drug listing, recordkeeping, manufacturing, marketing activities, product sampling and distribution, annual reporting and adverse event reporting.
If new safety issues are identified following approval, the FDA can require the NDA sponsor to revise the approved labeling to reflect the new safety information; conduct post-market studies or clinical trials to assess the new safety information and implement a REMS program to mitigate newly-identified risks. The FDA may also require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the FDA-approved label. Further, if we modify a drug, including any changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the FDA may require us to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
If after approval the FDA determines that the product does not meet applicable regulatory requirements or poses unacceptable safety risks, the FDA may take other regulatory actions, including initiating suspension or withdrawal of the NDA approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:    

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;

17


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs.
In December 2015, we announced that we achieved an amicable resolution with the U.S. in our lawsuit filed in September 2015 against the FDA and other governmental defendants. The resolution confirmed that EXPAREL is, and has been since its approval in 2011, broadly indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. In April 2018, the FDA approved an expansion of the label for EXPAREL to include interscalene brachial plexus nerve block. The new indication statement in the label for EXPAREL now reads: “EXPAREL is indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy has not been established in other nerve blocks.”
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
For example, in Europe, there are several tracks for marketing approval, for product approval and post-approval regulatory processes, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission, or EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.
In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has (i) a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; (ii) a decentralized procedure whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval and (iii) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and the other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holder. 
As with FDA approval, we may not be able to secure regulatory approvals in Europe in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, as in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing or distribution would apply to any product that is approved in Europe, and failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize any product.

In addition to regulations in Europe and the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of EXPAREL and any future products.
Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our products and product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers at the federal, state and private levels. Government payer programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy is not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The United States Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment that could impact our ability to sell our products at a price level high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment, which would materially impact our results of operations.
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates owed to states by pharmaceutical manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act also established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which drug manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand name drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. There have been proposed in Congress a number of legislative initiatives regarding healthcare, including possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the Affordable Care Act. The full impact that the Affordable Care and other new laws will have on our business is uncertain. However, such laws appear likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products.
The marketability of our products may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Some third-party payers require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies, or place limits on the amount of reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party payer reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers or that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available so that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Marketing/Data Exclusivity
The FDA may grant three or five years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for the approval of new or supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the application. Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. is available under Section 505A of the FDCA if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or non-patent exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. Based on our clinical trial program for EXPAREL, the FDA granted three years of marketing exclusivity to EXPAREL, which expired on October 28, 2014.

Manufacturing Requirements
We must comply with the FDA’s cGMP requirements and comparable regulations in other countries. The cGMP provisions include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA and other authorities pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers we engage or with which we partner are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with these and other statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product or product complaints must be reported and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
Regulations Pertaining to Sales and Marketing
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or “sunshine” provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.
In April 2015, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, requiring the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to marketing and promotional practices related to EXPAREL. We are cooperating with the government’s inquiry. We can make no assurances as to the time or resources that will need to be devoted to this inquiry or its final outcome, or the impact, if any, of this inquiry or any proceedings on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and 
20

protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, the new law makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Environmental Matters
Our research and development processes and our manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and produce waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines and/or sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 518 employees. All of our employees are located in the U.S. except for eight located in England. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
