ITEM 1. Business
Merger of Celladon Corporation and Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.
 On March 22, 2016, Celladon Corporation, or Celladon, and privately-held Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., or Private Eiger, completed a business combination in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2015, by and among Celladon, Celladon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celladon, or Merger Sub, and Private Eiger, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Eiger, with Private Eiger surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celladon. This transaction is referred to herein as “the Merger.” Immediately following the Merger, Celladon changed its name to “Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.” In connection with the closing of the Merger, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol “EIGR” on March 23, 2016.
Overview
 Eiger is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of well-characterized drugs for life-threatening, rare and ultra-rare diseases with high unmet medical needs and no approved therapies. Eiger has reported positive proof-of-concept clinical results in four programs: lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir, peginterferon, lambda, avexitide, and lonafarnib monotherapy, all with first-in-class drugs, now advancing into submission for regulatory approvals or Phase 3 clinical development. 
 Eiger’s lead program is in Phase 3, developing lonafarnib, a first-in-class prenylation inhibitor for the treatment of Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) infection. The company is also preparing an NDA and MAA with plans to submit in 2019 for lonafarnib in the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS or Progeria) and Progeroid Laminopathies. In addition, we recently announced positive Phase 2 data with peginterferon lambda for HDV infection and avexitide for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). 
 Our programs have several aspects in common: the disease targets represent conditions of high unmet medical need with no approved therapies; the therapeutic approaches are supported by an understanding of disease biology and mechanism as elucidated by our academic research relationships; prior clinical experience with the product candidates guides an understanding of safety; and the development paths leverage the experience and capabilities of our experienced, commercially-focused management team.

Our pipeline overview is illustrated below. As discussed above, prior clinical experience by our licensors with the product candidates has supported and guided our understanding of safety in advancing these products in our clinical development programs. Specifically, we in-licensed lonafarnib from Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, or Merck, in 2010 and licensed peginterferon lambda from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, in April 2016. We have relied upon Merck’s and BMS’ prior Phase 1/2/3 clinical data, manufacturing and experience with these two molecules to proceed directly into Phase 2 clinical trials following authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and will rely on that data and information to support potentially pivotal clinical trials and any filings for regulatory approvals. 



Note: All dates represent our current expectations. Actual timing may vary.
 Our product candidate pipeline includes four programs, all advancing toward Phase 3 or regulatory submissions for approval:
  
1. | Lonafarnib (LNF) in Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV)
---+------------------------------------------------

 Lonafarnib, or LNF, is a well-characterized, orally bioavailable, first-in-class farnesylation inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trials for HDV infection and is our most advanced program. HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis for which there is currently no approved therapy. Chronic HDV infection can lead to a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, a greater likelihood of developing liver cancer, and has the highest fatality rate of all the chronic hepatitis infections.
 We in-licensed LNF from Merck in 2010. LNF is a small molecule that blocks the production of HDV virus particles by inhibiting a key step, called farnesylation, in the virus life cycle. We have completed Phase 2 studies in 129 HDV-infected patients dosed with LNF across five international clinical trials. LNF has demonstrated dose-related activity in reducing HDV viral load both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Phase 2 studies have identified two lonafarnib-based regimens that can achieve clinically meaningful composite endpoints of HDV RNA decline ≥ 2 logs from baseline and normalized alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, a key liver enzyme, at Week 24: all-oral regimen of LNF 50 mg boosted with ritonavir (RTV) twice daily and combination regimen of LNF boosted with RTV combined with PEG IFN-alfa-2a. Predominantly grade 1 gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were observed in Phase 2 amongst per-protocol treated patients. Forty-eight-week dosing will be explored in Phase 3 and is expected to improve outcomes.
 3


Our Phase 3 study is a single, pivotal, international trial called D-LIVR that is designed to support U.S. regulatory approval. D-LIVR has the potential to generate data for two lonafarnib-based ritonavir-boosted regimens for approval.  An all-oral arm of LNF boosted with RTV and a combination arm of LNF boosted with RTV combined with PEG IFN-alfa-2a will each be compared to placebo in the Phase 3 D-LIVR study. The first site was initiated in December 2018, and we plan to complete enrollment (n=400) in 2019.
 LNF for the treatment of HDV infection has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation by FDA and PRIME designation by EMA. The potential market for HDV therapies in the United States and Western Europe is growing due to increased migration from regions where the disease is endemic, primarily from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
  
2. | Peginterferon Lambda (Lambda) in HDV
---+-------------------------------------

 Peginterferon lambda, or Lambda, is our second program treating HDV. Lambda is a well-characterized, late-stage, first in class, type III interferon, or IFN, that stimulates immune responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections. Lambda targets type III IFN receptors which are distinct from the type I IFN, receptors targeted by IFN-alfa. These type III receptors are highly expressed on hepatocytes with limited expression on hematopoietic and central nervous system cells, which has been demonstrated to reduce the off-target effects associated with other IFNs and improve the tolerability of Lambda. Although Lambda does not use the IFN-alfa receptor, signaling through either the IFN-lambda or IFN-alfa receptor complexes results in the activation of the same Jak-STAT signal transduction cascade.
 We licensed worldwide rights to Lambda from BMS in April 2016. Lambda has been administered in clinical trials involving over 3,000 patients infected with the Hepatitis B Virus, or HBV, or Hepatitis C Virus, or HCV. Lambda has not been approved for any indication. We plan to develop Lambda as a monotherapy and /or in a combination therapy with LNF + RTV. We completed a Phase 2 Lambda monotherapy study in 33 HDV-infected patients at four international sites and reported end of treatment data in October 2018. End of study data will be reported in April 2019. In August 2018, we initiated enrollment of a Phase 2 Lambda combination study with LNF boosted with RTV at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) (n=26). End of treatment data is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 In July 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for Lambda as a potential treatment for HDV infection, and in September 2017, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for Lambda for the treatment of HDV infection.
  
3. | Lonafarnib (LNF) in Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies (PL)
---+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We are also developing lonafarnib for treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathies, with plans to submit an NDA and MAA in 2019. Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), is an ultra-rare and rapidly fatal genetic condition of accelerated aging in children. Progeria is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene, encoding the lamin A protein, yielding the farnesylated aberrant protein, progerin. Lamin A protein is part of the structural scaffolding that holds the nucleus together. Researchers now believe that progerin may make the nucleus unstable, and that cellular instability may lead to the process of premature aging in Progeria. Children with Progeria die of the same heart disease that affects millions of normally aging adults (arteriosclerosis), but at an average age of 14.5 years. Disease manifestations include severe failure to thrive, scleroderma-like skin, global lipodystrophy, alopecia, joint contractures, skeletal dysplasia, global accelerated atherosclerosis with cardiovascular decline, and debilitating strokes. 
It is estimated that 400 children worldwide have Progeria.
 Progeroid laminopathies are genetic conditions of accelerated aging caused by a constellation of mutations in the lamin A and/or Zmpste24 genes yielding farnesylated proteins that are distinct from progerin. While non-progerin producing, these genetic mutations result in disease manifestations with phenotypes that have overlap with, but are distinct from Progeria. Collectively, worldwide prevalence of progeroid laminopathies is likely greater than Progeria.
 In May 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. which provides for expansion of the existing exclusively licensed field of use under the license agreement with Merck to include all uses of lonafarnib related to the treatment of Progeria and progeroid laminopathies.

In August 2018, Eiger and the FDA engaged in a collaborative discussion regarding the survival data that was published in April 2018 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) as potential support for submission of an NDA submission. This clinical study, which compared children with Progeria who received lonafarnib monotherapy with matched untreated children with Progeria, reported a primary outcome of significantly improved mortality. The study found that children taking lonafarnib monotherapy (n=63) experienced a 77 percent reduction in the risk of mortality compared to a natural history, matched-control cohort of untreated children (n=63) after two years of study. Eiger plans to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA and MAA based on this published study in 2019.
 Lonafarnib has been granted Orphan Drug designation for Progeria by the FDA and EMA. In October 2018, lonafarnib was granted Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) and Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for both Progeria and progeroid laminopathies.
  
4. | Avexitide in Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)
---+-----------------------------------------------

 Avexitide (formerly known as exendin 9-39) is a well-characterized peptide that we are developing as a treatment for PBH. PBH is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition for which there is currently no approved therapy. This disorder occurs often in a subset of bariatric surgeries called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or RYGB, where affected patients experience frequent symptomatic hypoglycemia, with blood glucose concentrations often low enough to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness and even death. Gastric bypass procedures are widely performed and are increasing in frequency for medically complicated obesity.
 We have completed four clinical studies demonstrating clinical proof of concept in 54 patients suffering from severe, refractory PBH indicating that avexitide can prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia in affected patients. Avexitide is a glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor antagonist that competes with endogenous GLP-1 and prevents the excessive post-prandial insulin release that characterizes this disorder. These Phase 2 data were generated using both intravenous and subcutaneous, or SC, formulation delivery. Pharmacokinetics from these Phase 2 SC studies indicate that the SC formulation could enable once or twice a day pre-prandial dosing. We developed a proprietary SC liquid formulation and completed a Phase 1 dose-ranging pharmacokinetics trial in healthy humans. In October 2018, we reported positive topline data from PREVENT, a multi-center, placebo-controlled study investigating the safety and durability of effect of 28-day dosing of SC avexitide in post-bariatric surgical patients. The primary efficacy endpoint of improved postprandial glucose nadir during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT) was achieved with statistical significance with fewer participants requiring glycemic rescue during each of the active dosing regimens than during placebo dosing. The secondary endpoint of reduced postprandial insulin peak during MMTT was also statistically significant.
 Avexitide for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and for the treatment of non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS) by the EMA. NIPHS describes a spectrum of acquired metabolic disorders characterized by inappropriately high insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia) and low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia), which includes PBH.  
  
5. | Ubenimex
---+---------

 Ubenimex is a well-characterized, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of leukotriene A4 hydrolase, or LTA4H, the enzyme responsible for converting the inflammatory mediator leukotriene A4, or LTA4, to leukotriene B4, or LTB4.
 In October 2018, topline results for the Phase 2 ULTRA study results in primary and secondary lymphedema were announced. No improvement of ubenimex over placebo in the primary endpoint of skin thickness and secondary endpoints of limb volume and bioimpedance was observed. No safety signals attributed to ubenimex were identified.  Eiger has discontinued development of ubenimex in lymphedema based on these results.
 In January 2018, Phase 2 LIBERTY study results in PAH demonstrated no improvement overall or in key subgroups for both the primary efficacy endpoint of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and the secondary endpoint of 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). No safety signals attributed to ubenimex were identified in the preliminary analysis. Eiger has discontinued development of ubenimex in PAH based on these results.

Business Model and Management Team
 We believe that our approach to clinical development enables achievement of early clinical signals of efficacy and safety in our Phase 2 programs and potentially reduces clinical risks and costs inherent in the drug discovery and development process. We have a highly experienced management team whose members have, in the course of their prior employment, participated in bringing more than 20 product candidates through regulatory approval and into commercialization. We plan to leverage our management team’s breadth and depth of experience in clinical and regulatory drug development as well as market development and commercialization to identify potentially promising product candidates to address unmet medical needs.
 Our current product candidate pipeline has been obtained by in-licensing from pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. With our focus on rare and ultra-rare diseases, our strategy is to acquire and retain some or all commercialization rights to our products in significant territories to diversify risk, identify a rapid regulatory pathway to approval and minimize the development investment in order to maximize long-term value for our stockholders. Over time, depending upon the data and potential market opportunity, we expect to establish a commercial organization, which we believe can be targeted and cost effective for selected, promising orphan disease designated programs. We plan to balance these interests with opportunities to out-license assets from our portfolio enhance stockholder value through partnerships and other strategic relationships.
 We plan to continue evaluating in-licensing opportunities in order to enhance our pipeline and leverage our business development, clinical development, regulatory and commercial expertise. We believe our management team has the capability and experience to continue to execute this model. Our management team has worked in other private and public biotechnology companies such as Prestwick Pharmaceuticals, New River Pharmaceuticals, Clinical Data Inc., CoTherix and InterMune, each of which was acquired by a larger pharmaceutical industry company. Our management also has previous work experience, in some cases working together, at pharmaceutical companies, including The Upjohn Company, Glaxo, Glaxo Wellcome, Glaxo Smith Kline, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Halozyme, Clinical Data Inc., New River Pharmaceuticals, Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Schering-Plough, Globe-Immune, Amylin, Zeneca, Aimmune Therapeutics, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Onyx and Amgen.
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to identify, develop, and, directly or through collaborations, bring to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases or conditions. We currently have a diverse portfolio of well-characterized product candidates with the potential to address life-threatening diseases for which the unmet medical need is high and, for which there is no approved therapy. Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious unmet medical needs in rare and ultra-rare diseases. Our focus to achieve this goal will be to utilize our experience and capabilities to:

• | Advance our existing product candidates through late-stage clinical trials, generating meaningful clinical results;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Work with U.S. and international regulatory authorities for expeditious, efficient development pathways toward registration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepare for commercialization of each program;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Use our industry relationships and experience to source, evaluate and in-license well-characterized product candidates to continue pipeline development; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify potential commercial or distribution partners for our products in relevant territories.

Our Product Candidates
 Lonafarnib (LNF) in HDV
 Lonafarnib, or LNF, is a well-characterized, late-stage, first in class, farnesylation inhibitor that we in-licensed from Merck in 2010 for the treatment of HDV infection. LNF is a well-characterized, orally active, small molecule inhibitor of farnesyl transferase, an enzyme involved in modification of proteins through a process called farnesylation. HDV uses this farnesylation process inside host liver cells to complete a key step in its life cycle. LNF inhibits the farnesylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the virus life cycle at the stage of assembly. Since farnesylation carried out by a host enzyme, there is a higher barrier to develop viral resistance mutations to LNF therapy. 
 We are in Phase 3 with a single, pivotal, international trial called D-LIVR. D-LIVR has the potential to generate data for two LNF-based RTV-boosted regimens for approval. An all-oral arm of LNF boosted with RTV and a combination arm of LNF boosted with RTV combined with PEG IFN-alfa-2a will each be compared to placebo in the D-LIVR study. First site was initiated in December 2018, and we plan to complete enrollment (n=400) in 2019.  
 Peginterferon Lambda (Lambda) in HDV
 Peginterferon Lambda (Lambda) is a well-characterized, late-stage, first in class, type III interferon, or IFN, that we in-licensed from BMS in April 2016 for the treatment of HDV infection. Lambda stimulates immune responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections. Lambda targets type III IFN receptors which are distinct from the type I IFN receptors targeted by IFN-alfa. These type III receptors are highly expressed on hepatocytes with limited expression on hematopoietic and central nervous system cells, which in BMS’s clinical trials reduced the off-target effects associated with other IFNs and improved the tolerability of Lambda. Although Lambda does not use the IFN-alfa receptor, signaling through either the lambda or IFN-alfa receptor complexes results in the activation of the same Jak-STAT signal transduction cascade. Lambda has not been approved for any indication. 
 We are developing Lambda as both a monotherapy and a combination therapy with lonafarnib. We have completed dosing in the Phase 2 LIMT Lambda monotherapy study (n=33) and reported topline data in November 2018 demonstrating comparable antiviral activity to peginterferon alfa with better tolerability. End of follow-up data will be reported at EASL 2019 where a 36% durable virologic response was demonstrated. We have also initiated enrollment of the Phase 2 LIFT combo study of Lambda in combination with LNF boosted with RTV at the NIH (n=26). Topline data from this 24-week dosing trial is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Hepatitis Delta Virus Overview
 About Hepatitis Delta Virus
 Hepatitis delta infection is caused by HDV, a small circular ribonucleic acid, or RNA, that expresses only one protein, the hepatitis delta antigen, or HDAg. There are two forms of HDAg; small and large. Together, these two forms of HDAg and the single-stranded RNA genome are surrounded by a lipid envelope, which is embedded with Hepatitis B Virus, or HBV surface antigen, or HBsAg, proteins. HDV does not encode its own envelope proteins and must acquire them from HBV during the final steps of replication. Hence, natural HDV infections always occur in the presence of a co-existing HBV infection. HBsAg is the only element of HBV relied upon by HDV. HDV replication can occur independently of HBV replication.
 HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis. HDV can be acquired either by co-infection (a simultaneous co-infection with HDV and HBV) or by super-infection (HDV infection of someone already harboring a chronic HBV infection). Both co-infection and super-infection with HDV result in more severe complications compared to infection with HBV alone. These complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, with an increased chance of developing liver cancer in chronic infections. HDV has the highest fatality rate of all the hepatitis infections at up to 20%. Although HDV/HBV simultaneous co-infection in adults usually resolves completely, in some cases it can become fulminant hepatitis, which carries a very high mortality rate. In the case of super-infections, the predominant form of HDV, HDV super-infection leads to a more severe form of disease than chronic HBV mono-infection. In a study published in 1987 in 
 7


the Journal of Infectious Diseases (Fattovich, G. et al. “Influence of Hepatitis Delta Virus Infection on Progression to Cirrhosis in Chronic Hepatitis Type B,” J Infect Dis, 1987; 155:931), histological liver deterioration was observed in 77% of HBV patients co-infected with HDV over a 15-year follow-up period, versus 30% of patients infected with HBV alone (p<0.01). In a 2013 study of chronic HBV patients published in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Gish, R. et al. “Coinfection with hepatitis B and D: epidemiology, prevalence and disease in patients in Northern California,” J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2013; 28(9):1521), cirrhosis was present in 73% of HBV patients co-infected with HDV, compared to only 22% of those infected with HBV alone. Patients co-infected with HDV are more than twice-as-likely to develop liver-related complications, cirrhosis, or require liver transplants than matched patients infected with HBV alone.
 HDV is generally spread through exchange of body fluids either sexually or through contact with infected blood. Globally, it is estimated that between 4.3% and 5.7% of the 240 million worldwide chronic HBV population, or 15 to 20 million people, are infected with HDV. The prevalence of HDV in patients infected with chronic HBV is even higher in certain regions, including certain parts of Mongolia, China, Russia, Central Asia, Pakistan, Turkey, Africa and South America, with an HDV prevalence as high as 60% being reported in HBV-infected patients in Mongolia and Pakistan. The prevalence of HDV has recently begun to increase in Western Europe and the United States due to migration from countries with high infection rates.
 The Role of HDV Screening in Identifying Patients Who May Benefit from LNF and/or Lambda
 There are diagnostic tests in use today in clinical laboratories to detect anti-HDV antibodies in serum. These tests are currently able to detect acute HDV infections after four weeks, but they are poor tests for active HDV infections. Active HDV infections are best detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, assays for genomic RNA. These assays yield a quantitative assessment of the number of viral particles, or viral load, in serum. A commercial assay for quantitative HDV RNA has been available in Europe (Robogene®) since 2015. Quest Diagnostics and ARUP Laboratories offer commercial assays for quantitative HDV RNA testing in the United States. Both of these assays are calibrated using the World Health Organization HDV standard provided by the Paul Erhlich Institute in Germany.
 Our initial discussions with payors have indicated that they would be willing to reimburse healthcare providers for HDV RNA quantitative assays that are carried out following a positive HBsAg test for HBV. A commercially available assay will increase the number of assays performed and increase the number of identified patients who can potentially benefit from an HDV therapy such as LNF.
 Current Therapy for HDV
 Currently, there is no approved therapy for hepatitis delta virus infection. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, or the AASLD, guidelines suggest treatment of chronic hepatitis delta infections with IFN-alfa. In clinical trials of IFN-alfa or PEG IFN-alfa, between 25% and 33% of HDV infected patients were able to achieve PCR HDV RNA negativity after a minimum of 48 weeks of therapy, with some requiring two years of therapy. However, long-term therapy with IFN-alfa is known to be associated with numerous adverse events and tolerability is a significant problem for some of these patients. In addition, rebound of HDV RNA occurs in greater than 50% of patients. HBV nucleoside analogs that suppress HBV DNA are ineffective against HDV since they are ineffective in suppressing the expression HBsAg. Current development programs targeting HBV functional cures are not expected to eliminate extra-hepatic reservoirs of HBsAg. Given that HDV only requires small amounts of HBsAg for viron assembly, functional cures, if achieved, will not eradicate HDV. 
 HDV Replication and Farnesylation
 After HDV enters a target cell hepatocyte, the genome is translocated to the nucleus where genome replication occurs and the two forms of HDAg small delta antigen, or SHDAg, and large delta antigen, or LHDAg, are produced. The newly formed HDV genome and the small and large delta antigen must acquire a lipid envelope from HBV to complete the assembly process. An important interaction between HDV and HBV proteins has been shown to depend on the presence of the last four amino acids of the large delta antigen, comprising a CXXX box motif, where C represents cysteine and X denotes any other amino acid. This amino acid sequence is required for LHDAg to be farnesylated by a host enzyme which covalently attaches a 15-carbon prenyl lipid (farnesyl-moiety) to the 
 8


cysteine of the CXXX box. Farnesylation of the large delta antigen renders it more lipophilic, promotes its association with HBsAg and is essential for initiating the HDV particle formation process. Our approach involves targeting this host process called farnesylation, or protein farnesylation, which has been shown to be essential for the last steps in HDV replication, the assembly and release of new virus progeny.
 In the 1980s farnesyltransferase inhibitors were developed by multiple pharmaceutical companies for oncology indications. Addition of a farnesyl or prenyl lipid group to the Ras protein, or Ras, a well-known and important regulator of cellular proliferation, allows for membrane association. Once membrane bound, Ras may then be activated. The importance of activated Ras in tumor development was demonstrated by sequence analyses of tumors from patients where up to 30% have mutations involving Ras. Several farnesylation inhibitors were developed in oncology and taken into the clinic and in some cases through late-stage clinical development. However, these programs did not lead to approvals, due to a lack of compelling efficacy. The class-related, dose-limiting toxicity has been gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss.
 Published studies demonstrate that farnesyltransferase inhibitors block HDV viral production both in cellular experiments and in HDV transgenic mice. Targeting farnesylation or farnesyl transferase, a host target, significantly reduces the likelihood of HDV developing resistance to escape effects of antiviral therapy. Viruses mutate quickly and there is a higher rate of mutations in viral replication compared to mammalian cell division. However, no matter how much HDV may mutate, these changes are unlikely to alter the host process of farnesylation which HDV requires to complete packaging. Thus, targeting a host farnesylation process provides what we believe to be a higher barrier to resistance. Identification of clinic-ready farnesylation inhibitors has allowed us to move rapidly into proof-of-concept studies in humans.
 Our Lead HDV Opportunity: LNF 
 LNF is a well-characterized, orally active inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. LNF inhibits the farnesylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the ability of the virus to multiply. Since farnesylation is a host process, not under control of HDV, and LNF inhibits farnesylation, we believe that there is also a potentially higher barrier to resistance with LNF therapy. LNF for the treatment of HDV infection has been granted Orphan Drug designation in Europe and the United States, and LNF in combination with RTV has been granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation from FDA for the treatment of chronic HDV infections. In the United States, we have an issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,076,512, entitled “Treatment of Hepatitis Delta Virus Infection.” The issued claims cover a broad range of RTV-boosted LNF doses and durations. The European Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office have also both issued decisions to grant patents with claims covering a broad range of lonafarnib boosted with RTV dosing regimens for the treatment of HDV infection. With the grant of these new European and Japanese patents, LNF boosted with RTV has now obtained patent protection with claims covering treatment with LNF boosted with RTV in key major pharmaceutical markets including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. We are in Phase 3 with a single, pivotal, international trial called D-LIVR, with first site initiated in December 2018. This is a 48-week study with planned enrollment of 400 patients across 20 countries and over 100 sites. LNF has never been approved or commercialized for any indication.
 LNF Phase 2 Clinical Data
 We in-licensed LNF from Merck in 2010, and have relied upon Merck’s prior Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical experience with LNF in over 2000 patients to understand safety and pharmacokinetics.
 We have completed five Phase 2 trials (POC, LOWR-1, LOWR-2, LOWR-3, LOWR-4) with LNF in 129 HDV-infected patients. The Phase 2 LOWR HDV (Lonafarnib With Ritonavir in HDV) Program identified dose(s) and regimen(s) for registration.

The Phase 2 NIH proof-of-concept study demonstrated statistically significant decreases in HDV RNA viral load with two LNF active groups versus placebo for 28-days. A statistically significant correlation between increasing LNF serum levels and decreasing HDV RNA viral loads was also observed, demonstrating that higher serum levels resulted in greater decline in HDV RNA.
 
The Phase 2 LOWR studies demonstrated benefits of twice daily RTV-boosting of LNF for up to 24 weeks of dosing. RTV is a pharmacokinetic, or PK, enhancer known to inhibit the metabolism of LNF, allowing lower doses of LNF to be administered, while resulting in higher systemic concentrations of LNF. The Phase 2 LOWR HDV studies identified two LNF-based regimens that can achieve clinically meaningful composite endpoints of HDV RNA decline ≥ 2 logs from baseline and normalized ALT at Week 24:  All-oral regimen of LNF 50 mg BID boosted with RTV twice daily and combination regimen of LNF 50 or 25 mg BID boosted with RTV combined with PEG IFN-alfa-2a (see figures below). These dosing regimens were associated with predominantly grade 1 GI AEs amongst per-protocol treated patient.

Phase 3 D-LIVR Study
 D-LIVR (Delta Liver Improvement and Virologic Response in HDV) is an international, multi-center, Phase 3 study of approximately 300 LNF-treated patients (total N=400 patients including controls) to evaluate an all-oral arm of LNF boosted with RTV and a combination arm of LNF boosted with RTV combined with pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (PEG IFN-alfa-2a), with each arm to be compared to a placebo arm (background HBV nucleos(t)ide only), in HDV-infected patients. A PEG IFN-alfa-2a alone arm will be dosed to demonstrate contribution of effect only. The LNF containing arms will not be required to demonstrate superiority over PEG IFN-alfa-2a alone. A combined primary endpoint of ≥ 2 log10 decline in HDV RNA and ALT normalization at end of 48 weeks of treatment will be used to assess activity of LNF-based regimens versus placebo in the D-LIVR study.
 First D-LIVR site initiated in December 2018. This is a 48-week study has planned enrollment of 400 patients across 20 countries and over 100 sites. 
 

Our Second HDV Therapeutic Approach: Lambda for HDV
 Lambda is a well-characterized, late-stage, first in class, type III interferon, or IFN, that we in-licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb in April 2016 for the treatment of HDV infection. Lambda stimulates immune responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections. Lambda targets type III IFN receptors which are distinct from the type I IFN receptors targeted by IFN-alfa. These type III receptors are highly expressed on hepatocytes with limited expression on hematopoietic and central nervous system cells, which has been demonstrated to reduce the off-target effects associated with other IFNs and improve the tolerability of Lambda (Chan 2016). Although Lambda does not use the IFN-alfa receptor, signaling through either the IFN-lambda or IFN-alfa receptor complexes results in the activation of the same Jak-STAT signal transduction cascade. 
 In clinical trials of IFN-alfa or PEG IFN-alfa-2a, between 25% and 33% of HDV-infected patients were able to clear their infections, or SVR24, after a minimum of 48 weeks of therapy, with some requiring two years of therapy. However, long-term therapy with IFN-alfa is known to be associated with numerous adverse events and tolerability is a significant problem for some of these patients. We believe Lambda will be a safer and better tolerated pegylated interferon compared to PEG IFN-alfa-2a. We plan to develop Lambda as a monotherapy and in a combination therapy with LNF. We completed the Phase 2 LIMT monotherapy study using Lambda to treat HDV in 33 patients at four international sites and reported end of treatment data in October 2018. 24 week follow-up data will be

reported in April 2019 at EASL where 36% durable virologic response was observed at 24 weeks post-treatment. In August 2018, we initiated enrollment of the Phase 2 LIFT combination study of Lambda combined with LNF boosted with RTV at the NIH (n=26). End of treatment data is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. Lambda has never been approved or commercialized for any indication.
 Lambda Clinical Data
 LIMT HDV Monotherapy Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 The LIMT HDV was a 1:1 randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of Lambda 120 or 180 microgram subcutaneous injections administered weekly for 48 weeks in 33 patients with chronic HDV. End of treatment will be followed by a treatment-free 24-week observation period. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment with two dose levels of Lambda monotherapy in patients with chronic HDV infection. All patients were administered an anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analog throughout the study. The trial is being conducted at four international sites in New Zealand, Israel and Pakistan. 
 End of treatment Week 48 data was presented during AASLD 2018 in San Francisco. At Week 48, patients in the 180 μg Lambda treated group experienced a -2.4 log10 mean decline in HDV-RNA, with 6 of 10 (60%) experiencing ≥ 2 log10 decline, 4 of 10 (40%) patients were HDV-RNA negative at end of treatment.  At Week 48, patients in the 120 μg Lambda treated group experienced a -1.5 log10 mean decline in HDV RNA, with 6 of 14 (42.9%) experiencing ≥ 2 log10 decline, 2 of 14 (14.3%) patients were HDV-RNA negative at end of treatment. The most commonly reported AEs were moderate headache, pyrexia, fatigue, and myalgia.  ALT flares are due to vigorous antiviral immunological response to treatment, not due to direct hepatotoxicity. End of 24-week follow-up demonstrated a 36% durable virologic response which will be presented at EASL 2019. Lambda is a promising agent for mono or combination treatment (i.e. with lonafarnib) development in the treatment of HDV. 
LIFT HDV Combotherapy Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 LIFT (Lambda Interferon combo-Therapy) is an open-label, Phase 2 study evaluating Lambda + Lonafarnib + Ritonavir in 26 HDV-infected patients. Patients will be dosed for 24 weeks + undergo follow up for 24 weeks.  Primary endpoint will be ≥ 2 log decline in HDV RNA at end of treatment. Secondary endpoints will include histology (> 2 point improvement in histological activity index and no progression in fibrosis) at end of treatment.  LIFT is being conducted within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). LIFT plans to complete enrollment with 26 patients in the first quarter of 2019, and end of treatment data is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Potential for Registration in HDV for LNF and Lambda
 Our current goal in developing LNF and Lambda is to suppress the virus and reduce liver inflammation. Therefore, we have defined a primary endpoint for D-LIVR as a 2 log reduction in HDV RNA and ALT normalization. Our long term goal in developing LNF and Lambda is to reduce viral load in such a manner as to achieve durable suppression of the virus to below the level of quantification (<LLOQ), the point where, upon withdrawal of the therapy, the infection does not return to quantifiable levels. Evidence that academic investigators have gathered suggests that combinations of LNF and Lambda with other antiviral agents may hold promise for longer duration treatment and sustained, long-term reduction of viral load. 
 We also believe that treatment with LNF and Lambda in combination with other anti-HDV investigational agents may contribute to long-term benefit for patients, which may represent an alternative path to regulatory approval. In a study published in Plos One in 2014 (Romeo, R. et al. “High Serum Levels of HDV RNA Are Predictors of Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis Delta,” Plos One, 2014; 9:1), high serum levels of HDV were found to be a predictor of cirrhosis and liver cancer development. In a study published in Gastroenterology in 2004 (Farci, P. et al. “Long-Term Benefit of Interferon Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis D: Regression of Advanced Hepatic Fibrosis,” Gastroenterol, 2004; 126:1740), researchers demonstrated that lower frequencies of clinical events, leading to improvements in overall liver health and reductions in the rates of developing hepatic complications, could be achieved in HDV infected patients who were treated with high dose IFN-alfa and who experienced biochemical response and sometimes as little as 2 log declines in viral load. A 2014 
 12


Hepatology study by Heidrich suggests that transient suppression of HDV replication in patients treated with PEG IFN-alfa-2a improves the clinical long-term outcome, as not a single patient in their study with a post-treatment Week 24 HDV RNA response experienced a clinical event, including those patients who experienced viral rebound. We believe that these studies suggest that eradication of HDV RNA may not be necessary in patients treated with IFNs to achieve a substantial clinical benefit and improve long-term outcomes.
 Avexitide for Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia
 Avexitide is the third product candidate in our pipeline. Avexitide is a glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor antagonist. GLP-1 is a gut-derived incretin hormone released by intestinal “L” cells after meals. Incretin hormones, such as GLP-1, enhance the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner, thereby lowering blood glucose levels after meals. Avexitide blocks GLP-1 from binding to the GLP-1 receptor, inhibiting the GLP-1-mediated incretin effect. We are developing avexitide as a treatment for PBH, which is characterized by an exaggerated incretin response, with patients exhibiting low levels of glucose and excessively high levels of insulin in the blood after meals. This form of hypoglycemia is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition. Gastric bypass procedures are widely performed and are increasing in frequency for medically complicated obesity. There is no approved therapy for PBH, and the unmet medical need is high.
 We have demonstrated clinical proof of concept in 54 patients suffering from PBH that avexitide can prevent an exaggerated fall in blood sugar following a meal, or post-prandial hypoglycemia, in affected patients. Data has been generated using both intravenous delivery and SC delivery. Pharmacokinetics indicate that the SC delivery could enable once or twice a day pre-prandial dosing. We have developed a novel liquid formulation for SC injection and have completed a Phase 1 PK study with this new formulation of avexitide in healthy volunteers in mid-2017. We completed a Phase 2 multiple ascending dosing trial (up to 3 days) in affected patients with our avexitide SC novel liquid formulation in 2017, and have completed a Phase 2, 28 day study (PREVENT) in affected patients using of the new SC formulation in the third quarter of 2018. 
 Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia Overview
 As the use of bariatric surgical procedures has increased worldwide, a new post-surgical complication, hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, has been increasingly diagnosed and reported in the procedures that involve reducing the size of the stomach with a vertical sleeve gastrectomy or by resecting and re-routing the small intestine to a small stomach pouch (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). This disorder leads to frequent symptomatic hypoglycemia, often resulting in glucose concentrations low enough to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, cognitive dysfunction, disability and death. Quality of life can be severely diminished, and many patients cannot care for themselves or others, work, drive, or be left alone. There is no approved treatment for this condition. Severe cases have historically been surgically managed with near-total to total pancreatectomy, which results in insulin dependent diabetes and is associated with a greater than 6% surgical mortality risk.
 Research suggests that elevated GLP-1 may play an important role in mediating the glucose-lowering effect associated with bariatric surgery. Surgically-altered nutrient transit, such as a Roux-en-Y procedure, causes early nutrient sensing by the intestinal “L” cells, resulting in enhanced secretion of GLP-1 leading to elevated insulin secretion. This effect may play a primary role in the early resolution of Type 2 diabetes after surgery. A number of synthetic analogs of GLP-1, or agonists, have been approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes including Byetta™ (exenatide), Victoza™ (liraglutide), and Trulicity™ (dulaglutide). These drugs, all agonists, bind to the GLP-1 receptor and enhance the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with PBH, excessive secretion of GLP-1 and/or exaggerated sensitivity to GLP-1 results in dysfunctional insulin release, leading to severe, debilitating hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor antagonists compete with endogenous GLP-1 and has the potential to prevent dysfunctional insulin release and resultant symptomatic hypoglycemia.
 Approximately 200,000 bariatric surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States, and another 100,000 are performed each year in Europe. Approximately 30% of these bariatric surgeries are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures.

Our Next Product Candidate: Avexitide to Treat Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia 
 Avexitide (formerly exendin 9-39) has recently been adopted by the United States Adopted Name (USAN) Council and will be the International Nonproprietary Name (INN), which is used to identify pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients. Each INN is a unique name that is globally recognized. Eiger plans to seek approval for a proprietary name or brand name during Phase 3 development.
 Avexitide is a well-characterized, competitive antagonist of GLP-1 at its receptor. Avexitide is a 31 amino acid fragment of exenatide, a commercially available GLP-1 agonist, brand named Byetta™ used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Avexitide blocks the GLP-1 receptor and leads to reduced post-prandial levels of insulin secreted by the pancreas. While exenatide has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, avexitide is a new molecular entity and has never been approved nor commercialized for any indication.
 Clinical Data to Date
 We have demonstrated in four clinical studies with avexitide that pharmacologic blockade of the GLP-1 receptor can prevent hypoglycemia in affected patients and mitigate symptoms of hypoglycemia. We believe that avexitide may represent the first targeted medical treatment for patients with PBH. In the four completed studies, there were no significant adverse drug reactions attributed to avexitide.
 The first avexitide study was a Phase 1, double-blinded crossover study wherein eight patients with PBH were randomly assigned to receive IV infusion of avexitide or placebo during an oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT (Craig et al, Diabetologia 2016). The trial assessed patient blood glucose and insulin levels and the presence and severity of symptoms of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia was defined as glucose levels falling to or below 50 mg/dL. 
 In this trial, IV infusion of avexitide raised the postprandial glucose nadir by over 70% and lowered the area under the curve insulin by 57%, normalizing both parameters relative to healthy nonsurgical controls, and preventing hypoglycemia in all eight participants. In contrast, during placebo infusion every patient became hypoglycemic, requiring investigator intervention with administration of IV dextrose when patient plasma glucose fell to a level of 50 mg/dL or less. 
 To assess for the presence and severity of symptoms of hypoglycemia during IV infusion of avexitide versus placebo, patients completed severity-grade questionnaires every 30 minutes during each 180-minute OGTT period. The severity-grade questionnaires showed that, on average patients experienced fewer and less severe hypoglycemic symptoms during IV infusion of avexitide as compared to during IV infusion of placebo (p<0.001). While symptoms reported by subjects during the glucose rise (from T=0 to peak glucose) were unchanged by avexitide infusion, both autonomic (p=0.002) and neuroglycopenic (p=0.001) symptoms reported during the glucose fall period (from peak to nadir glucose) were reduced.
 The second clinical proof of concept study, a Phase 2 clinical trial, was a single ascending dose, or SAD, and avexitide was administered subcutaneously in eight patients with PBH. This was the first investigation involving the SC administration of avexitide in human subjects and was designed to examine the PK, PD, and local tolerability of SC avexitide in patients with PBH. After metabolic and symptomatic responses to a baseline 75 g OGTT were evaluated, patients returned for a repeat OGTT with administration of a single avexitide dose, ranging from approximately 10–30 mg (0.13–0.38 mg/kg).
 14


In all eight patients undergoing the OGTT, avexitide administration prevented hypoglycemia and reduced symptoms of hypoglycemia. The baseline OGTT resulted in a high peak in plasma glucose concentration for all eight patients, followed by a rapid, steep decline, with all patients requiring rescue with IV dextrose at a plasma glucose concentration of 50 mg/dL. In contrast, prevention of hypoglycemia occurred at all dose levels of SC avexitide tested, with all patients completing the 180-minute OGTT without requiring intervention with IV dextrose. While early glycemic responses (fasting plasma glucose, peak postprandial glucose, time to peak glucose, and AUC glucose from 0–60 minutes postmeal) were unchanged by administration of SC avexitide, late glycemic responses (nadir glucose, time to nadir glucose, AUC glucose from 0–180 minutes) were significantly improved. The average nadir glucose was increased by 61%, as shown in the figure below.

Symptoms of PBH were assessed using the Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Symptom Scale, which was completed by patients every 30 minutes during each 180-minute OGTT. Patients used the scale to report the presence and severity of autonomic or neuroglycopenic symptoms or symptoms of malaise. SC avexitide reduced symptoms of PBH overall and during the glucose fall period without altering symptoms during the glucose rise period. While symptoms associated with PBH were observed during this study, no adverse reactions attributed to avexitide were identified, and no injection site reactions were reported in any patients in this study.

A third study with avexitide completed in June 2017. This was a Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, and PK profile of multiple ascending doses of subcutaneously administered avexitide in patients with PBH. A liquid and a lyophilized formulation of SC avexitide were evaluated in the MAD study. 
 
Key findings from this study demonstrated that both SC avexitide liquid and lyophilized formulations reduced postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, reduced hypoglycemic symptoms and were well tolerated with no related adverse events. In addition, SC avexitide liquid formulation improved postprandial metabolic and clinical parameters with comparable or greater activity versus the lyophilized formulation. The liquid formulation produced a pharmacokinetic profile which may confer a longer duration of action versus the lyophilized formulation.

The PREVENT study is the fourth Phase 2 study with avexitide completed in October 2018. The PREVENT study was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study to assess the efficacy and safety of 28-day dosing of avexitide in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). A total of 18 patients were enrolled and treated with two dosing regimens (once daily and twice daily) of avexitide for 28 days. All patients participated in three 14-day treatment periods, involving placebo subcutaneous (SC) injections, once-daily avexitide SC injections, and twice-daily avexitide SC injections. Patients self-administered injections in an outpatient setting.  Participants underwent in-clinic mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) provocations with concomitant blood draws and symptom assessments following each treatment period. Metabolic and clinical improvements were monitored during each patients’ daily routines in the outpatient setting and assessed by electronic diary and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Outcomes include improvement in plasma glucose nadir levels, reduction in peak insulin concentrations, and the requirement for rescue during MMTT provocation.
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of improved postprandial glucose nadir during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT) was achieved with statistical significance with avexitide 30 mg BID (57.1 vs 47.1 mg/dL; p = 0.001) and 60 mg QD (59.2 vs 47.1 mg/dL; p = 0.0002), with fewer participants requiring glycemic rescue during each of the active dosing regimens than during placebo dosing. The secondary endpoint of reduced postprandial insulin peak during MMTT was also statistically significant with avexitide 30 mg BID (349.5 vs 454.5 mIU/mL; p < 0.03) and 60 mg QD (357.2 vs 454.5 mIU/mL; p = 0.04). 
 
Metabolic and clinical improvements were also monitored during each patients’ daily routine in the outpatient setting and assessed by electronic diary and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Patients experienced fewer episodes of hypoglycemia (hypoglycemia symptoms confirmed by self-blood glucose monitor (SBGM) concentrations of <70 mg/dL) and severe hypoglycemia (neuroglycopenic symptoms confirmed by SBGM concentrations <55 mg/dL) during both dosing regimens of avexitide as compared to placebo. These results were corroborated by CGM data.  
 Avexitide was well-tolerated. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events and no participant withdrawals. Adverse events were typically mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were injection site bruising, nausea, and headache, all of which occurred with lower frequency during avexitide dosing periods than during the placebo dosing period.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical studies and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical trial quantities of our product candidates and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contracted manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing our CMOs.
 To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for the product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands but have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical material. We plan to identify commercial contract manufacturers as we move our product candidates to Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe there are alternate sources of manufacturing that could be identified and enabled to satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, however, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources can be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates.
 Commercial contract manufacturers for Lonafarnib and Interferon Lambda have been identified and plan to proceed with qualifications.
 18


Lonafarnib (LNF)
 The drug product for completed LNF Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of HDV was manufactured by Merck. We have successfully completed the technology transfer for manufacture of the LNF drug substance and the LNF drug product to our third-party manufacturers. All future clinical trials will be conducted with product manufactured by these CMOs. 
 Peginterferon Lambda (Lambda)
 We are completing the technology transfer from BMS for our Peginterferon Lambda program. As part of the license agreement, sufficient inventory of drug substance and drug product was obtained to complete our Phase 2 and initiate our Phase 3 clinical trials. We have completed the first cGMP drug product manufacturing campaign in 2017 at a new Eiger designated manufacturing facility. The drug substance CMO remains the same CMO contracted by BMS and is currently under evaluation to update for the drug substance manufacturing process.
 Both Lonafarnib and Lambda are GMP products from all CMOs.
 Avexitide
 The drug product for avexitide for the treatment of PBH for Phase 2 clinical studies is manufactured by a third-party CMO.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect those proprietary technologies we believe are important to our business. We seek and maintain, where available, patent protection for our product candidates including: composition of matter, method(s) of use, and process patents covering manufacture and/or formulation. We have also licensed patents and patent applications that cover certain of our product candidates and/or their manufacture, use, or formulation.
 We also rely, or plan to rely, on regulatory exclusivity, including Orphan Drug designation and New Chemical Entity, or NCE, and Biologic License Application, or BLA, exclusivities, as well as trade secrets and carefully monitor our proprietary information to protect all aspects of our business.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications on new dosage forms, methods of treatment, and compositions of matter for our product candidates. We file and prosecute patent applications in the United States and Europe and, when appropriate, additional countries, including Japan, Korea and China.
 Our success will depend significantly upon our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain patents and other exclusivity protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; (ii) prosecute our patent applications to issue as patents and defend and enforce our patents; (iii) maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by others; (iv) preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and (v) operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of others. In addition to maintaining our existing proprietary assets, we seek to strengthen our proprietary positions when economically reasonable to do so. Our ability to augment our proprietary position relies on its: (i) know-how; (ii) ability to access technological innovations, and (iii) ability to in-license technology when appropriate.
 The patent positions of pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. In addition, the scope claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced during the patent prosecution process before any patent issues. After issuance of a patent, if the issued patent is challenged, then the courts or a patent office can redefine the scope of the patent, including by invalidating some or all of the patent claims, or rendering the patent unenforceable in its entirety. Consequently, we do not know with certainty whether patents will issue in each country in which we or our licensors file patent applications, or if those patent applications, if ever issued, will issue with claims that cover our product candidates, or, even if they do issue, whether the patent or its relevant claims will remain enforceable upon challenge. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as 
 19


patents in a particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from potential competitors to make any of our products commercially successful. Any of our patents, including already issued in-licensed patents or any patents that may issue to us or our licensors in the future, could be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Newly filed patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and certain other patent offices are maintained in secrecy for a minimum of 18 months, and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag far behind the actual discoveries themselves. For these reasons, we cannot be certain that inventions claimed in pending patent applications were not invented by another party prior to our invention or disclosed or claimed in a patent application filed before the effective filing date of our applications, in either of which case the claims may not be patentable to us. For certain applications with an effective filing date prior to March 13, 2013, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Also, while we are not currently participating in any interferences or post-grant challenge proceedings, such as patent oppositions, post-grant reexamination proceedings, inter parties review proceedings and patent litigation, that seek to invalidate claims of pending patent applications or issued patents, we may have to participate in such proceedings in the future. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries where they are issued. In most countries, the standard patent term for inventions relating to human drugs and their formulation and use is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional patent or international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970, or the PCT.
 The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a single PCT application can be converted into a patent application in any of the more than 145 PCT contracting states, providing a cost-effective means for seeking patent protection in numerous regions or countries. Conversion of a PCT application into an application in any of the contracting states typically occurs about 30 months after a priority application is filed, or about 18 months after the PCT application filing date. An applicant must undertake prosecution within the allotted time in the patent offices of any, or a combination, of the contracting states or in a regional patent office it determines to undertake patent issuance in protection in such country or territory. 
 Patent Protection of Our Product Candidates
 Our product candidates and/or their uses in one or more indications of interest to us are covered by in-licensed patents and patent applications and by our own patent applications.
 Lonafarnib (LNF). We have in-licensed from Merck a portfolio of patents covering the compound, formulations of the compound, and synthesis, but these expire before the anticipated launch date of the LNF product candidate. 
 In the United States, we have obtained patent protection for the use of LNF in combination with RTV for the treatment of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection. On September 18, 2018, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U.S. Patent No. 10,076,512 to Eiger. This patent entitled, “Treatment of Hepatitis Delta Virus Infection,” includes claims covering broad range of RTV-boosted LNF doses and durations.  The patent has a term that extends to 2035. Additional claims are being pursued in a continuation application. The European Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office have also both issued decisions to grant patents with claims covering a broad range of LNF boosted with RTV dosing regimens for the treatment of HDV infection. These patents will have a term that extends to 2035. In Europe, additional claims are being pursued in a divisional application. With the grant of these new European and Japanese patents, we have now obtained patent protection with claims covering treatment with LNF boosted with RTV in key major pharmaceutical markets including the U.S., Europe, and Japan.
 Corresponding patent applications claiming the use of lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir are pending in China and Korea.
 Additionally, a PCT application claiming particular dosage regimens for ritonavir-boosted lonafarnib for the treatment of HDV infections was filed and has now matured into national phase applications in Europe, China, Japan and Korea. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2036. In addition, LNF has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and the EMA in this indication, which respectively provide seven and ten years of regulatory exclusivity. 
 20


We have also filed a PCT application for LNF/RTV combination drug products useful for treating HDV. This PCT application matured into currently pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2036.
 Peginterferon-Lambda (Lambda). We have in-licensed from BMS a portfolio of patents relating to the manufacture, use, and compositions of interferon Lambda modified by polyethylene glycol derivatization, or Lambda. The key United States composition of matter patent in this portfolio expires in 2025, but we expect to be eligible for the full five years of patent term extension for that patent. In addition, we expect Lambda to be filed under a BLA and so Lambda would be eligible for 12 years reference product exclusivity (4 years in filing exclusivity; 12 years for data), as well as orphan drug exclusivity in this indication. 
 We also filed a PCT application relating to the use of Lambda in HDV, which matured into patent applications in the United States, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2036.
 Avexitide. We have in-licensed from Stanford two PCT applications that claim the use of avexitide and other agents in the treatment of hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, including in PBH. The PCT applications have matured into patent applications in the United States, the European Patent Office (EPO), Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Chile. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2036 without extension and up to five years of patent term extension will be available in the United States. Additionally, avexitide has been granted Orphan Drug designation in this indication by the FDA and the EMA, which provides seven years and ten years of regulatory exclusivity in the United States and Europe, respectively. 
 We also filed a PCT application for formulations of avexitide and the use of these formulations in the treatment of hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery. This application is still pending. Any patents that issue from this application will expire in 2037.
 Patent Term
 In the United States, the patent term for an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension, or a PTE. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The length of the PTE is based on the length of time it takes for the drug to complete the pre-market regulatory approval requirements. The time required for approval of an NDA or BLA and 50% of the time spent in testing phase, reduced by any periods of lack of diligence, are credited up to a maximum five-year extension. The PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent per approved drug may be extended and a patent can only be extended once; thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product.
 Similar provisions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug may be available in certain other foreign jurisdictions. For example, in Europe, a supplementary protection certificate (commonly referred to as a SPC), if granted, may extend certain patent rights for up to five years. In addition, in Europe, marketing approval obtained through the EMA may provide a period of ten years of regulatory data exclusivity from the time of approval. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of NDAs and BLAs for our products, we expect to apply for patent term extension for patents covering certain product candidates and their methods of use both in the United States and any foreign jurisdiction where available. There is no guarantee, however, that the applicable authorities will agree to grant extensions, and if granted, what the length of those extensions will be.
 Other Proprietary Rights and Processes
 We also rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business, scientific, development or

 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Given the significant unmet medical need for novel therapies to treat chronic hepatitis delta infection, post-bariatric surgery-induced hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery and lymphedema, these conditions are where various treatments from many companies are used and where many public and private universities and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of product candidates. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive resources invested in the discovery and development of new products to treat these unmet medical needs. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
 In addition, there are numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same indications as our product candidates. Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have or will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in developing or marketing products and technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly. Additionally, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly and may achieve more widespread market acceptance. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 Our potential competitors and the related stage of development of their product candidates in target indications is as follows:
  
• | Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV): Myr (Phase 3), Replicor, Inc. (Phase 2)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies: none
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH): Xeris Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are other therapies that are used or may be used for our targeted indications, and these other products in clinical development or marketed for other indications may be used in competition with our product candidates if we are able to identify potential market opportunities of interest. For example, HDV has not been generally identified as a target for development compared to hepatitis B or hepatitis C, and products on the market or in development for those indications may potentially be tested in HDV as the understanding of the potential medical need for therapies in this indication become more widely understood.
 22


We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, cost-effectiveness, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from the government and other third-parties. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated for any of our products if our competitors have products that are approved earlier than our product candidates or are superior compared to our product candidates or if our product candidates do not result in an improvement in condition compared to those other products.
 License and Asset Purchase Agreements
 License Agreement with Merck
 In September 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Schering Corporation, subsequently acquired by Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, which provides us with the exclusive right to develop and commercialize lonafarnib. As consideration for such exclusive right, we issued Private Eiger convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $0.5 million when the agreement was executed in September 2010. This preferred stock was converted to 27,350 shares of common stock upon the Merger. In addition, we are obligated to pay Merck up to an aggregate of $27.0 million in development milestones and will be required to pay tiered royalties based on aggregate annual net sales of all licensed products ranging from mid-single to low double-digit royalties on net sales. Our obligation to pay royalties to Merck expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent assigned to us under the agreement, which is estimated to be in the first half of 2018; or on the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product. In May 2015, the first regulatory milestone was achieved, and we paid the related milestone payment of $1.0 million to Merck. No additional milestone payments were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Merck License will continue for so long as we owe royalty payments to Merck under the agreement. Each party has the right to terminate the Merck License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. Merck also has the right to terminate the agreement if we discontinue development and commercialization of LNF for a specified period of time. In addition, we have the right to terminate the agreement, with notice, for any reason.
 On May 15, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the exclusive license agreement with Merck, which provides for expansion of the existing exclusively licensed field of use under the license agreement with Merck to include all uses of lonafarnib related to the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome in humans at no cost to us. We have the sole responsibility and the continuing obligation for the manufacture and supply of lonafarnib to The Progeria Research Foundation. Merck will not receive milestone payments in relation to lonafarnib for the treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathies or any royalty payments for sales of a specified quantity of lonafarnib to treat the currently estimated progeria and progeroid laminopathies patient population worldwide.
 Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiger Group International, Inc.
 In December 2010, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiger Group International, Inc., or EGI, dated December 8, 2010, or the EGI APA. Dr. Jeffrey Glenn is the sole owner of EGI.
 Under the EGI APA, we purchased all the assets including intellectual property rights related to the use of farnesyl transferase inhibitors as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infection with those inhibitors. We also purchased all assets including intellectual property rights related to the use of inhibitors of prenylation, prenyl cysteine methyltransferase, and a specified protease as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infection with those inhibitors. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products in major markets.
 Under the EGI APA, we paid EGI an upfront payment of $0.4 million. Additionally, we are obligated to pay EGI a low single-digit royalty based on aggregate annual net sales of products developed using the intellectual property. Within the first ten years after commercialization, we may make a one-time payment of $0.5 million for each contract for the three types of product related to such intellectual property that would reduce the payment term for the three products to the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale. The obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of either when the product is no longer sold in any country or the earliest of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product.
 23


The term of the EGI APA extends until expiration of all payment obligations, and we may terminate the agreement upon notice to EGI. EGI may terminate the EGI APA if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. In addition, each party may terminate the EGI APA for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. In the event of any termination, other than termination by us for EGI’s breach, we will assign the purchased assets back to EGI.
 In November 2012, we entered into an agreement with EGI whereby we sold all of the assets related to the compound clemizole, including any related intellectual property. EGI is obligated to pay to us a high single-digit royalty on future aggregate annual net sales, subject to certain reductions and exceptions. EGI’s obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of either expiration of the last to expire patent sold to EGI under the agreement or the earliest of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product.
 License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV
 In December 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary EB Pharma, LLC, or EBP, entered a License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, dated December 19, 2014, or the Janssen License Agreement.
 Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen granted us an exclusive, worldwide, license to develop, manufacture, and sell products containing the compound tipifarnib for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in humans, including any such uses for human virology diseases, but excluding oncology diseases.
 We are responsible for the development of at least one product in a major market country and for commercialization of products in all countries where necessary authorization is obtained, both at our cost and expense. We may manufacture, develop, and commercialize the products itself or we may grant one or more sublicenses for such purposes. However, for a period of time following completion of the proof of concept trial, Janssen has a first right of negotiation for an exclusive license back from us to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in any country in the world.
 Under the Janssen License Agreement, we are obligated to make development milestone payments in aggregate of up to $38.0 million, sales milestone payments in aggregate of up to $65.8 million, and pay a tiered royalty, ranging from the mid-single to low double digits, based on aggregate annual net sales of all licensed products. If we grant a sublicense, we are obligated to pay Janssen a portion of the sublicensing income received. As of December 31, 2018, the product has not reached commercialization and no milestones have been paid.
 The Janssen License Agreement will continue for so long as we owe royalty payments to Janssen under the agreement or for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the agreement, whichever is longer. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach of the agreement or for the other party’s bankruptcy. Janssen also has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to meet certain specified diligence obligations. In addition, we have the right to terminate the agreement without cause at any time. 
 Asset Purchase Agreement with Tracey McLaughlin and Colleen Craig
 In September 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with two individuals, Dr. Tracey McLaughlin and Dr. Colleen Craig, or the Sellers, dated September 25, 2015, or the Exendin APA. We also entered into a consulting agreement with the Sellers as part of the agreement.
 Under the Exendin APA, we purchased all the assets and the intellectual property rights related to the compound avexitide from the Sellers, including an assignment of a license agreement with Stanford which covered exclusive rights with respect to the compound avexitide. Under the assigned Stanford exclusive license agreement, we are obligated to pay Stanford a low, single-digit royalty on net sales after the first commercial sale of any product developed based on avexitide.
 24


Under the Exendin APA, we are obligated to pay development milestone payments in aggregate up to $1.0 million to each of the Sellers and a low, single-digit royalty based on aggregate annual net sales of all products developed based on avexitide subject to certain reductions and exceptions. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on the expiration of the last to expire patent assigned to us under the agreement. We also agreed to retain each of the Sellers as consultants pursuant to consulting agreements, each with a term of one year, subject to annual renewal. The consulting agreement with Dr. Tracey McLaughlin was extended to go through December 31, 2017. The consulting agreement with Dr. Colleen Craig expired in the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, upon the successful completion of the Phase 2 trials, the development milestone was achieved, and we paid the related milestone payment of $0.1 million to each of the Sellers.
 License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
 In April 2016, we entered into a License Agreement and a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, together BMS, the BMS Purchase Agreement and the BMS License Agreement.
 Under the BMS License Agreement, BMS granted us an exclusive, worldwide, license to research, develop, manufacture, and sell products containing the proprietary BMS molecule known as PEG-interferon Lambda-1a, or the Licensed Product, for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in humans and animals. 
 We are responsible for the development and commercialization of the Licensed Product at our sole cost and expense. In April 2016, under the BMS License Agreement we paid an upfront payment of $2.0 million in cash and issued 157,587 shares of our common stock to BMS with an aggregate fair value of $3.2 million. The BMS Purchase Agreement grants BMS certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock delivered, and BMS has agreed to certain trading and other restrictions with respect to the shares purchased.
 Under the BMS License Agreement, we are obligated to make development and regulatory milestone payments totaling $61.0 million and commercial sales milestones of up to $128.0 million after the achievement of specified milestones. We are also obligated to pay BMS annual net sales royalties in the range of mid-single to mid-teens, depending on net sales levels. If we grant a sublicense, we are obligated to pay BMS a portion of the sublicensing income received. As of December 31, 2018, the product has not reached commercialization and no milestones have been paid.
 Government Regulations and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and it’s implementing regulations. Our Lambda product candidate is additionally subject to regulation as a biologic under the Public Health Service Act. The FDA subjects drugs and biologics to extensive pre and post market regulation. Failure to comply with the FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties.
 25


FDA approval is required before any new biologic, drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States is long, expensive, and inherently uncertain. Drug development in the United States typically involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests, submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated, performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced, and FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product, disease or indication.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to characterize and assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations. These preclinical results are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical studies including reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity may be initiated or continue after the IND is submitted.
 An IND must become effective before United States clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND automatically becomes effective and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA does raise any concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, a submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials; and (ii) with protocols that detail, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to and approved by an IRB at each study site before the study commences at that site and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, or the IRB may impose other conditions. The study sponsor or the FDA may also suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 26


Clinical trials to support an NDA or BLA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although there is leeway to overlap or combine these phases.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition, and is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological activity, and, when possible, to ascertain evidence of efficacy. The drug candidate may also be tested in patients with severe or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The trials are conducted using a limited patient population for the purposes of preliminarily determining the effectiveness of the drug in that particular indication, ascertaining dosage tolerance, discerning the optimal dosage, and identifying possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. If a compound demonstrates evidence of efficacy and has an acceptable safety profile in the Phase 2 clinical trials, then Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information from an expanded and diverse patient population, at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in randomized controlled studies often with a double-blind design to maximize the reproducibility of the study results. Typically, a minimum of two positive Phase 3 clinical trials are submitted to support the product’s marketing application. These Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to provide sufficient data demonstrating evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug such that the FDA can evaluate the overall benefit-risk of the drug and provide adequate information for the labeling and package insert for the drug. Trials conducted outside of the United States under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to FDA in support of product approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational drugs must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most Phase 3 clinical trials of FDA-regulated products.
 In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications. FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with other detailed information including compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The application must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to both a substantial application user fee and annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
 27


The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of applications. Standard applications are generally reviewed within ten months of filing, or twelve months from submission. Although FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, the FDA can extend these timelines if necessary, and FDA review may not occur on a timely basis. The FDA usually refers applications for novel drugs, or drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—a panel of independent experts, typically including clinicians and other scientific experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of the advisory committee, but it generally follows its recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one, or more, clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it verifies that compliance with cGMP requirements is satisfactory and that the manufacturing processes and facilities are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA will not approve a product unless the application contains data showing substantial evidence that it is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the application and conducts its inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies contained in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application, including potentially significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of additional information requested. FDA approval is never guaranteed. The FDA may refuse to approve an application if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a drug may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product’s package insert, or labeling.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guidelines, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing-including dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a drug can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. The FDA may also condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or development of adequate controls and specifications.
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 28


505(b)(2) NDA Pathway
 As an alternative path to FDA approval, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant an Orphan Drug designation to products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting the NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the FDA publicly discloses the drug’s identity and its intended orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first active moiety to be approved to treat a disease with FDA’s Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, regardless of patent status, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different chemical/biological entity for the same disease or condition. An orphan drug designation also does not preclude the same drug from being developed for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research expenses and a waiver of the application user fee.
 
Rare Pediatric Disease, or RPD, designation by FDA enables priority review voucher, or PRV, eligibility upon U.S. market approval of a designated drug for rare pediatric diseases. The RPD-PRV program is intended to encourage development of therapies to prevent and treat rare pediatric diseases. The voucher, which is awarded upon NDA or BLA approval to the sponsor of a designated RPD can be sold or transferred to another entity and used by the holder to receive priority review for a future NDA or BLA submission, which reduces the FDA review time of such future submission from ten to six months.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. PRIME designation by the EMA confers comparable benefits on qualifying drug product candidates.
 29


Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). 
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Advertising and Promotion
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity as well as significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct any deviations from the FDA’s standards. The FDA may also impose a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and the company may face federal and/or state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
 Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new application or supplement before the change can be implemented. A supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs. Obtaining new indication is an important part of managing the life cycle of the drug.
 Adverse Event Reporting and cGMP Compliance
 Recordkeeping, adverse event reporting and the submission of periodic reports are required following the FDA’s approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing or Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug. In addition, the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Furthermore, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. Regulatory authorities may also withdraw product approvals, request product recalls, or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals upon discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA. These other agencies include, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Such agencies enforce a variety of laws, including without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and physician payment transparency laws.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated.
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
 We may be subject to data privacy and information security laws and regulations, including both foreign and domestic, in the locations in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its respective implementing regulations imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and requires the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $0.2 million per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of the drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approve may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Further, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to additional foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 International data protection laws, including, without limitation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and European Union (“EU”) member state data protection legislation, also apply to health-related and other personal data that we process, including, without limitation, personal data relating to clinical trial participants in the EU. The GDPR imposes, significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including, among other things, standards relating to the privacy and security of personal data, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. These laws may also include, without limitation, requirements for establishing an appropriate legal basis for processing personal data, transparency requirements related to communications with data subjects regarding the processing of their personal data, notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, an individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data, increased requirements pertaining to health data, requirements related to obtaining consent for processing personal information, and rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes obligations and required contractual provisions to be included in contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and that process personal data on behalf of such companies. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant regulatory fines and penalties.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In the United States and other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations.

The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
