History
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 16, 2011 as Load Guard Transportation, Inc., and subsequently changed its name to Load Guard Logistics, Inc. in 2012. 
 
On October 31, 2014, the Company closed a reverse merger transaction (the “Merger”) pursuant to which Nemus, a California corporation (“Nemus Sub”), became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and we assumed the operations of Nemus Sub. Nemus Sub was incorporated in the State of California on July 17, 2012. On November 3, 2014, the Company changed its name to Nemus Bioscience, Inc. by merging with Nemus Sub.
 
On October 31, 2014, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with LGT, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company transferred all of its assets and liabilities to LGT.
 
On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement with LGT, Yosbani Mendez and Francisco Mendez, pursuant to which the Company repurchased 5,431,460 shares of its common stock from Yosbani Mendez and Francisco Mendez for a repurchase price of all of the issued and outstanding shares of LGT. Upon the repurchase, the Company cancelled all of such repurchased shares.
 
Prior to the Merger, we were a transportation and logistics company engaged primarily in hauling truckload shipments of general commodities in both interstate and intrastate commerce. Following the Merger, we became a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based therapeutics. 
 
In January 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Emerald Health Sciences Inc. (“Emerald”), pursuant to which Emerald purchased a majority of the outstanding equity in the Company, resulting in a change in control of the Company. As part of the transaction, the members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), with the exception of Dr. Brian Murphy, the Company’s CEO and CMO, tendered their resignation, and Emerald appointed two nominees to the Board. In October 2018, the Board appointed Dr. Avtar Dhillon, the Chairman, CEO and President of Emerald, as the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to securing product licenses, carrying out research and development activities, building infrastructure and raising capital. We have not yet realized revenue from our planned principal operations. 
 
Business Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company targeting the discovery, development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based therapeutics through a number of license agreements with the University of Mississippi, or (“UM”). UM holds the only contract to cultivate cannabis for research purposes on behalf of the Federal Government of the United States since 1968, and it has significant expertise in cannabis cultivation and the extraction, separation, processing and manufacture of cannabis extracts as well as the chemistry and physiology of cannabinoid molecules. Nemus was established and continues to be, a development and commercialization partner of UM, working to bring the University’s proprietary cannabinoid molecules through the development process.

Our Strategic Partnership
 
In July 2013, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, with UM to engage in joint research of extracting, manipulating, and studying cannabinoids in certain forms to develop intellectual property with the intention of creating and commercializing therapeutic medicines. The MOU provided that we own all intellectual property developed solely by our employees and will jointly own all intellectual property developed jointly between Nemus and UM employees. The term of the MOU was five years and the parties agreed to enter into separate research agreements upon the identification of patentable technologies. This MOU resulted in the Company entering into several licenses and research agreements with UM related to a prodrug of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and an analog of cannabidiol (CBD). The term of the MOU agreement expired in 2018 and was not renewed because the Company and UM had entered into a number of licenses for the aforementioned compounds.
 
UM 5050 Pro-Drug Agreements
 
On September 29, 2014, the Company executed three license agreements with UM pursuant to which UM granted the Company exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licenses, including the right to sublicense, to intellectual property related to UM 5050, a pro drug of THC, for products administered through each of ocular, oral or rectal delivery. We paid UM upfront license fees for each of these licenses. 
 
In July 2018, Nemus decided to initially focus UM 5050 product development on developing ocular medicines for the treatment of ophthalmic-related diseases of the eye and the Company notified UM that it will renew the license for UM5050 related to ocular delivery of the prodrug of THC. 
 
Under the ocular delivery license agreement, we are also responsible for annual maintenance fees that will be credited against royalties in the current fiscal year, contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones, and royalties on net sales of licensed products sold for commercial use. The aggregate milestone payments due under the license agreement, if all the milestones are achieved, is $700,000 and the royalty percentage due on net sales is in the mid-single digits. We must also pay to UM a percentage of all licensing fees we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis, and end upon the later of the date that no valid claim of a licensed patent covers a licensed product in a given country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
 
The license agreement continues, unless terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or patent applications within the licensed technology or expiration of our payment obligations under the license. UM may terminate the license agreement, effective with the giving of notice, if: (a) we fail to pay any material amount payable to UM under the license agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (b) we materially breach any covenant, representation or warranty in the license agreement and do not cure such breach within 60 days after UM notifies us of such breach, (c) we fail to comply in any material respect with the terms of the license agreement and do not cure such noncompliance within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (d) we are subject to a bankruptcy event, (e) we dissolve or cease operations or (f) if after the first commercial sale of a product during the term of the license agreement, we materially fail to make reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one product or fail to keep at least one product on the market after the first commercial sale for a continuous period of one year, other than for reasons outside our control. We may terminate the license agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to UM.
 
On October 15, 2014, the Company signed a renewable option agreement for the rights to explore other routes of delivery of UM 5050 not yet agreed upon and/or in combination with other cannabinoids or other compatible compounds. The Company has been working with UM to establish new licenses derived from this option agreement and let the other routes of administration option expire. 
 
UM 8930 Pro-Drug Agreements
 
On December 14, 2015, the Company executed two license agreements with UM pursuant to which UM granted the Company exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licenses, including the right to sublicense, to intellectual property related to UM 8930, an analog of CBD, for products administered through each of ocular or rectal delivery. We paid UM upfront license fees for each of these licenses. In July 2018, the Company and UM renewed the ocular delivery license. 
 
Under the ocular delivery license agreement, we are also responsible for annual maintenance fees that will be credited against royalties in the current fiscal year, contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones, and royalties on net sales of licensed products sold for commercial use. The aggregate milestone payments due under the license agreement if all of the milestones are achieved is $700,000 and the royalty percentage due on net sales is in the mid-single digits. We must also pay to UM a portion of all licensing fees we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis, and end upon the later of the date that no valid claim of a licensed patent covers a licensed product in a given country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.

The license agreement continues, unless terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or patent applications within the licensed technology or expiration of our payment obligations under the license. UM may terminate the license agreement, effective with the giving of notice, if: (a) we fail to pay any material amount payable to UM under the license agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (b) we materially breach any covenant, representation or warranty in the license agreement and do not cure such breach within 60 days after UM notifies us of such breach, (c) we fail to comply in any material respect with the terms of the license agreement and do not cure such noncompliance within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (d) we are subject to a bankruptcy event, € we dissolve or cease operations or (f) if after the first commercial sale of a product during the term of the license agreement, we materially fail to make reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one product or fail to keep at least one product on the market after the first commercial sale for a continuous period of 1 year, other than for reasons outside our control. We may terminate the license agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to UM.
 
On December 14, 2015, the Company signed a renewable option agreement for the rights to explore other routes of delivery of UM8930 not yet agreed upon and/or in combination with other cannabinoids or other compatible compounds. The Company has been working with UM to establish new licenses derived from this option agreement and let the other routes of administration option expire. 
 
UM 5070 License Agreement
 
In January 2017, we entered into a license agreement with UM pursuant to which UM granted us an exclusive, perpetual license, including the right to sublicense, to intellectual property related to a platform of cannabinoid-based molecules (“UM 5070”), to research, develop and commercialize products for the treatment of infectious diseases. The license agreement culminates roughly one year of screening and target molecule identification studies especially focused on therapy-resistant infectious organisms like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”). 
 
We paid UM an upfront license fee under the license agreement. Under the license agreement, we are also responsible for annual maintenance fees that will be credited against royalties in the current fiscal year, contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones, and royalties on net sales of licensed products sold for commercial use. The aggregate milestone payments due under the license agreement if all of the milestones are achieved is $700,000 and the royalty percentage due on net sales is in the mid-single digits. We must also pay to UM a percentage of all licensing fees we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis, and end upon the later of the date that no valid claim of a licensed patent covers a licensed product in a given country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
 
The license agreement continues, unless terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or patent applications within the licensed technology or expiration of our payment obligations under the license. UM may terminate the license agreement, effective with the giving of notice, if: (a) we fail to pay any material amount payable to UM under the license agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (b) we materially breach any covenant, representation or warranty in the license agreement and do not cure such breach within 60 days after UM notifies us of such breach, (c) we fail to comply in any material respect with the terms of the license and do not cure such noncompliance within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (d) we are subject to a bankruptcy event, (e) we dissolve or cease operations or (f) if after the first commercial sale of a product during the term of the license agreement, we materially fail to make reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one product or fail to keep at least one product on the market after the first commercial sale for a continuous period of 1 year, other than for reasons outside our control. We may terminate the license agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to UM.
 
UM Research Agreement 
 
In August 2018, we entered into a research agreement with UM to conduct an animal study in normotensive animals to assess the use of NB1111, the prodrug of THC, THC-valine-hemisuccinate (“THCVHS”), using nanoemulsion delivery of the Company’s proprietary molecule when compared to a prostaglandin standard of care. Safety data will also be collected. The original term of the Research Agreement was through January 31, 2019. In February 2019 the term of the research agreement was extended through May 31, 2019. The agreement may be terminated for convenience or cause by either party at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of payments due by the Company under the contract for services rendered by UM is up to $155,156. Upon cancellation, the Company is responsible for paying any amounts incurred by UM in connection with the services through the termination date.
Our Product Candidates 
 
Cannabinoids are a class of chemically diverse compounds that are mainly found in extracts from the cannabis plant. These compounds express their physiological response by binding to specific cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), which are found throughout the body. Some cannabinoids have been observed to exert multiple effects on the human body, including, but not limited to: impacting the immune response, nervous system function and repair, gastrointestinal maintenance and motility, motor function in muscles, pancreatic functionality, modulating inflammation and tissue repair, blood sugar regulation, and integrity of function in the eye (including the optic nerve). Cannabis and specific cannabinoids have been studied widely, with limited published data suggesting the potential for these compounds to be used in treating many disorders or alleviating disease-associated symptoms.

We are focused on the development of early stage cannabinoid product candidates. The following table summarizes certain information regarding our cannabinoid product candidates:
 


Product Candidate | Indication | Development Status
------------------+-------------------------+-------------------
NB1111 | Glaucoma | Preclinical 
NB2222 | Multiple Ocular Targets | Preclinical 
NB3111 | MRSA | Research 

 
 NB1111
  Glaucoma is an ocular neuropathy associated with the initiation of programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, of the retinal ganglion cells, or (“RGCs”), of the optic nerve, resulting in progressive and irreversible loss of vision. Intraocular pressure, (“IOP”), has been identified as an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. Elevated IOP can lead to damage of RGC axons through vascular ischemia by compromising blood flow to the cells, and physical crush injury as the elevated ocular pressure compresses these delicate cells. Cannabinoid receptors are highly concentrated in the eye, especially in organs of the anterior compartment that help regulate IOP, and the posterior compartment in the area of the retina and optic nerve. Stimulation of cannabinoid receptors by THC has been previously shown to lower IOP in both animal and human studies.
 
Our lead ocular compound is NB1111, a prodrug of THC. The molecule has been formulated to make the usually lipophilic THC more hydrophilic to allow for improved transport across membranes. In 2013 and 2014, UM conducted studies of the formulation in the rabbit ocular model which showed that the molecule was able to penetrate all chambers of the eye which could potentially broaden the proposed therapeutic indications of interest to diseases of the eye that affect the retina and optic nerve, such as macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. These studies also revealed that the formulation was able to achieve potentially therapeutic concentrations in the anterior compartment, vitreous humor, and posterior compartment of the normal rabbit eye, which is very similar to the human eye in anatomy and physiology. The rabbit ocular model is an accepted animal model for regulatory agencies when considering a candidate drug for human testing and this data will be submitted as part of the investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA. 
 
Additional studies using an alpha-chymotrypsin induced glaucoma model in rabbits were performed by UM in 2013 and 2014 under a grant from the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH. Those studies showed that NB1111 was able to reduce IOP by 45% to 50%. Reduction in IOP was successful in an almost linear dose-responsive manner, with greater decline in IOP associated with higher dosage concentration. The decline in IOP observed in the rabbit model correlated to historical human data when patients were exposed to systemically administered THC via inhalational methods. The human studies were conducted by the NIH and the U.S. Army in the 1970’s where glaucoma patients for the NIH study and normal volunteers for the U.S. Army study were exposed to THC by smoking marijuana. Patients tested by the NIH exhibited a decline in IOP ranging from 35% to as high as 65%, correlated to the amount of THC in the plasma. Normal volunteers in the U.S. Army study also showed a decrease in IOP of approximately 10% to 20% in a setting of normotension. While THC from smoking marijuana was able to reduce IOP in humans, the effect was short lived given the short half-life of the THC molecule. The half-life of the pro-drug used in the rabbit glaucoma model was longer, but still pointed to the need to formulate the pro-drug in a way to lengthen the half-life that would be consistent with once-daily dosing of a marketed product.

We examined the compound in further testing using a nanoparticle delivery system to prolong the drug’s biologic half-life in late 2015 and 2016. The studies were conducted by UM and placed NB1111 into a solid lipid-nanoparticle system (“SLN”) to deliver the drug to the eye using topical drop administration. The SLN delivery of NB1111 was administered to rabbits that underwent elevated IOP inducement using the alpha-chymotrypsin model. Data from that experiment confirmed previous studies that showed administration of NB1111 resulted in a 45% reduction in IOP from baseline with a half-life consistent with five to six-times per day dosing. When NB1111 was administered via SLN delivery, the lower concentration of NB1111 (0.4% equivalent THC) exhibited a decrease in IOP of approximately 20% while the higher concentration of NB1111 (0.6% equivalent THC) lowered IOP by a maximum of 38%. The use of SLN technology lengthened the physiologic half-life of NB1111 equivalent to dosing the drug two to three times a day.
 
Further animal experimentation conducted in 2016-2017 examined both the penetration and concentration of NB1111 in key organs of the eye. The data revealed that IOP declined in a concentration-time dependent manner and could be correlated to the concentration of THC in organs regulating IOP, such as the trabecular meshwork in the anterior compartment and the retina-choroid in the posterior compartment. The data was important for demonstrating a direct causal relationship between the penetration and concentration of THC with IOP-lowering capability and the presence of THC in multiple compartments of the eye. Additionally, neither free-THC nor 11-hydroxy-THC (the main active metabolite of THC) was detected in the peripheral circulation of the test animals, indicating that the topical dosage of the test compound remained restricted to the eye.
 
Moving forward, if an IND is submitted to the FDA and becomes effective, we plan to undertake human testing in patients with underlying glaucoma. We anticipate proposing to the FDA that the first-in-human studies be conducted in patients with glaucoma (Phase 1b-2a) in a traditional dose-ranging study that will also collect safety data and assess which dosages best balance efficacy and safety. Initially, we plan to conduct single-ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple-ascending dose (“MAD”) studies to establish physiological activity in humans to define a dosing therapeutic window and to validate an ocular formulation for larger follow-on studies. Subsequently, Phase 2 studies will be advanced provided initial human clinical data point to IOP lowering activity balanced by safety parameters. Phase 2 studies in glaucoma are expected to be conducted over 7 to 28 days and patients place the test compound in one eye and the reference comparator in the other eye, thereby acting as their own controls. Given that IOP data is objectively measured, we will decide whether to conduct a subsequent Phase 2b study or go directly to a larger Phase 3 clinical trial based on the quality of the data collected in the Phase 2a study and the advice provided by the FDA or other regulatory bodies.
 
 NB2222
  NB2222 is a prototype ocular formulation of the proprietary Nemus CBD analog. We have embarked on studies with UM exploring the utility of our drug candidate NB2222 as an eye drop emulsion for the potential treatment and management of several eye diseases, including uveitis, dry eye syndrome, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Data presented at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) meeting held in November 2017 revealed that this early formulation of the CBD analog was able to penetrate multiple compartments of the eye, including reaching the retina and the optic nerve. Further testing will need to be conducted to assess biomarkers for the possible utility of this compound as a therapeutic agent. In 2019, Nemus expects to continue to work with UM to evaluate the neuroprotective activity of NB2222.

 NB3111
  MRSA was first described in 1961 after the introduction of the antibiotic, methicillin, and since that time, the prevalence of the organism has increased globally in both community and healthcare settings. The prevalence of MRSA in intensive care units in the United States has been estimated to be 60% (Am J Infect Control 2004; 32:470) with more than 90,000 invasive MRSA infections occurring annually in the United States resulting in more than 18,000 deaths (JAMA 2007; 298: 1763-71). Annual costs for treating MRSA in the United States are projected to exceed $4 billion, accounting for a collective eight million extra hospital days annually (ISPOR; 10th Annual Meeting, Wash D.C., May, 2005; Pew Foundation Research Brief, April, 2012).
 
MRSA is classically resistant to conventional antibiotics to treat staph infections such as fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and macrolides. Most patients who develop MRSA infections are usually colonized with either a community acquired strain (CA-MRSA) or healthcare-associated strain (HA-MRSA). Therefore, antibiotic development against MRSA can take three approaches: (a) decolonization, (b) treatment of localized soft tissue infections, or (c) systemic antibiotic for generalized sepsis.
 
Cannabinoid molecules have been shown in in vitro studies conducted by third parties to possess anti-infective activity against a variety of MRSA strains. We entered into a research agreement with UM to explore this area in 2015 and continue to test a variety of cannabinoids in various strengths, combinations, and delivery systems against a variety of MRSA species found in community, healthcare, and institutional settings such as nursing homes, correctional facilities, and military quarters. As discussed above in “Our Strategic Partnership – UM 5070 License Agreement,” in January 2017, we entered into a license agreement with UM pursuant to which UM granted us an exclusive, perpetual license, including the right to sublicense, to intellectual property related to UM 5070, a platform of cannabinoid-based molecules to research, develop and commercialize products for the treatment of infectious diseases.
 
Other Potential Products
 
The Company continues to plan to work with UM to explore other potential indications and associated routes of administration to expand the UM5050 and UM 8930 licenses. The Company’s decision to advance a potential therapeutic candidate will be influenced by a number of criteria, including but not limited to pre-clinical data, synthesis and formulation capability as well as prevailing market conditions.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Cannabis is subject to strict regulation in the United States. Cannabis and cannabis extracts are classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, as a Schedule I substance, which means that, under federal law, it has no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. In addition, the United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which imposes certain requirements and restrictions on member parties with respect to the cultivation and wholesale trade in cannabis. Since 1968, UM has held the only contract with the Federal Government to cultivate cannabis on its behalf for research purposes and holds the requisite DEA registrations authorizing it to engage in that activity. The contract, which is open for competitive bidding at periodic intervals, is administered by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, an agency within the NIH. UM’s current contract was awarded in 2015 and runs for a base year of one year with four one-year options. Although in August 2016 the DEA announced that it would consider granting registrations for the cultivation of cannabis for research and development purposes outside of the NIDA contract process, we are not aware of any entity that has received such a registration under this process. As the sole contract holder since 1968, UM has developed significant expertise in the extraction, separation, processing and manufacture of cannabinoids. UM has also engaged in the cultivation of cannabis and the extraction of cannabinoids for purposes of developing drug product candidates apart from its role as NIDA contractor. We have entered into several research and license agreements with UM and view this collaborative association as a significant strategic advantage in the marketplace.
 
The only cannabinoid products that are currently approved as drugs in the United States and, to our knowledge, all cannabinoid products in late-stage development, are predominantly orally-delivered products. Cannabinoids, when ingested orally, are subject to significant first pass metabolism by the liver and potential drug-drug interactions, resulting in very high inter-patient and intra-patient variation in bioavailability which can potentially compromise both efficacy and safety. This has been published in the literature and in product labeling by regulatory agencies worldwide. These independent assessments correlate with highly variable response rates and safety profiles which, in some cases, have been deemed to have marginal clinical utility.
 
We have licensed from UM the rights to a pro-drug formulation of THC. Data from UM supports the delivery of the pro-drug through absorptive routes other than the gastrointestinal tract, which we believe has the potential to mitigate the issue of first-pass metabolism by the liver, potentially enhancing drug bioavailability and predictive pharmacokinetics. 
 
We are also working with UM and other parties on methods to formulate and deliver a variety of other pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoids to better manage symptoms and/or treat diseases.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a premier developer of prescriptive cannabinoid-based medicines for global markets with significant unmet medical needs. Our current operating strategy includes:
 

· | selection of potential clinical targets based on internal and external published data, access to appropriate cannabinoids, and the impact of both developmental and market conditions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | prioritization of product candidates based on the potential clinical utility of associated target indications; 
· | utilization, where feasible, of naturally-derived drug prototypes leading to synthetically produced cannabinoid derivatives optimized for development and commercialization; 


9


· | development and execution of an intellectual property strategy; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | development and advancement of our current product pipeline; 
· | outsourcing services, such as use of Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturers for the API, where possible and appropriate;
· | obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other appropriate regulatory agencies for product candidates; 
· | research and development of additional target indications for cannabinoid product candidates; and 
· | partnering, out-licensing, or selling approved products, if any, to optimize Company efficiencies to bring state-of-the-art therapeutics to patients. 

Sales and Marketing
 
We have not established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead product candidates are still in research, discovery or preclinical development stages. If and when we obtain approval to market any of our product candidates, we will evaluate what we believe to be the optimal commercialization path for the Company, the respective product candidate, and patients. Commercialization paths may include licensing, selling, or partnering with other commercial partners. We may also choose to build a commercial sales and marketing team for some or all of our product candidates.
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for final manufacture. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize.
 
We entered into agreements with AMRI in February 2016 and July 2018 for the development and manufacture of our proprietary cannabinoid-based APIs. In late 2016, we finalized a commitment with Teewinot Life Sciences, working in conjunction with AMRI, to manufacture biosynthetically produced cannabinoids to be used in clinical trials. It is anticipated that the biosynthetically generated API will eventually form the basis of our drug candidates NB1111 in development for glaucoma and NB2222 for ocular diseases. In February 2019, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with Noramco to develop scale-up synthesis methods and to manufacture the analog derivative, CBD-valine-hemisuccinate (“CBDVHS”). 
 
For all of our future product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the API and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The success of most of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
 

· | obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | prosecute our patent applications and defend any issued patents we obtain; 
· | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and 
· | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 


10

 
We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for certain of our product candidates, drug delivery systems, molecular modifications, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected global territories. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for medical uses, processes for isolation and preparation, processes for delivery and formulations.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have licensed from UM two U.S. patents as well as foreign counterparts in the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and Australia. The patents that we license cover composition of matter and preparation of delta-9 THC amino acid esters and their methods of use. These patents are expected to expire in 2034. Under our license agreements, UM retains ownership over the licensed patents and control over the maintenance and prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we do, and greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing product candidates, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for indications we pursue that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely-prescribed or accepted, more useful and less costly, and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. We also face competition from third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials and in identifying and acquiring or in-licensing new products and product candidates.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations or prevail in any enforcement action or litigation related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
 
Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabinoids
 
DEA Regulation
 
Cannabis, cannabis extracts and some cannabinoids are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, or the CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.

The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Cannabis, cannabis extracts and some cannabinoids are listed by the DEA as Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. The registered entity must maintain records for the handling of all controlled substances and must make periodic reports to the DEA. These include, for example, distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. The registered entity must also report thefts or losses of any controlled substance and obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. In the event of non-compliance, the DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
State Regulation
 
The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961
 
Many countries, including the United States, are parties to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, or the Single Convention, which is an international treaty that governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis and cannabis extracts. The Single Convention requires all parties to take measures to limit the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, and use and possession of cannabis exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. In particular, the Single Convention requires member countries to establish a government agency to oversee the cultivation of marijuana and establish a monopoly on the wholesale trade of marijuana, and it provides that this role must be filled by a single government agency if the member country’s constitution so permits.
 
Party members, including the United States, may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that restricts our ability to develop and obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in accordance with our current plans and partnership with UM. 
 


12

NIDA
 
Pursuant to the Single Convention, NIDA oversees the cultivation of research-grade cannabis for medicinal research on behalf of the United States Government. NIDA has historically fulfilled this obligation through a contract that it administers with UM. UM has been the sole NIDA contractor to grow cannabis for research purposes since 1968. The contract is open for competitive bidding at periodic intervals. Since 1999, the term of the contract has been five years. UM engaged in a competitive bidding process for the next contract interval and was awarded the contract in 2015. Under the NIDA contract, UM grows, harvests, stores, ships and analyzes cannabis of different varieties, as NIDA requires. In August 2016 the DEA announced that it would consider granting registrations for the cultivation of cannabis for research and development purposes outside of the NIDA contract process. We are not aware of any entity that has received such a registration under this process to date.
 
UM has represented that it also grows cannabis for purposes of researching cannabis extracts, and has in the past grown cannabis, purified cannabis extracts, and distributed extracts for purposes of developing product candidates, separate and apart from its contract with NIDA. UM has indicated that it conducted these activities pursuant to separate registrations from the DEA and that it plans to seek the necessary additional DEA registrations to conduct the contemplated activities in connection with our partnership, in compliance with applicable law and the United States’ obligations under the Single Convention. However, there is a risk that regulatory authorities may disagree and decline to authorize UM to engage in these activities.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication; 
· | submission of a NDA to the FDA; 
· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
· | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 


13

Preclinical Studies
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
· | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Marketing Approval
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes at least twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. However, if issues arise during the review, the FDA may request additional information and the review period may be extended to permit the applicant to provide and the FDA to review that information, which may significantly extend this time period.

14

 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to a NDA must contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information requested. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews a NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving a NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 
The testing and approval process for a NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
 
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, such as our product candidates, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 


15

 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.
 
Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 
Hatch Waxman Act
 
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
Hatch Waxman Patent Exclusivity
 
In seeking approval for a drug through a NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

· | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the listed patent has expired; 
· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

 
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 


17

Hatch Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity
 
In addition to patent issues, market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug.
 
This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other versions of a drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 


18

 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 
Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law on March 2010, created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 


19

 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products, if approved, could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. By way of example, in the United States, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
 
We expect that the Trump administration will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the ACA and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the burdensome provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. As such, we cannot predict what effect the ACA or other healthcare reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future will have on our business. 
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. While our management and many of our consultants are familiar with and have been responsible for gaining marketing approval in many countries, we have not reviewed the specific regulations in countries outside of the United States, as it pertains to cannabinoids.

Additional Regulation
 
We are a reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and, therefore, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, our financial reporting is subject to United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and U.S. GAAP is subject to change over time.
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations applied to businesses generally. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions.
 
Our Scientific Advisory Board 
 
We have a scientific advisory board (the “Advisory Board”) that includes experts in cannabinoids, drug discovery and medicine. The composition of the Advisory Board will change over time to meet the research and development demands of the Company and our drug candidate pipeline. The current Advisory Board consists of two international experts in their fields, Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly and Dr. Donald Abrams. 
 
Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly works in close collaboration with our team to identify new research directions and accelerate our target validation and drug discovery programs. At UM, Dr. ElSohly serves as the Director of the NIDA Marijuana Project where he carries out a wide range of activities dealing with the chemistry, analysis and product development aspects.
 
Donald I. Abrams, M.D., Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of California San Francisco and Chief of the Hematology-Oncology Division at San Francisco General Hospital, joined the company’s Scientific Advisory Board in January 2016. He provides consultative services relating to the use of cannabinoids in palliative care in cancer-associated conditions.
 
Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our scientific advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. 
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have a total of three full-time employees, one of whom has a M.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We anticipate that we will need to hire approximately four additional employees or independent contractors for our continued development efforts. We also intend to utilize independent contractors and outsourced services, such as CRO’s, and third-party manufacturers, where possible and appropriate.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not descriptions of historical facts are forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. If such risks or uncertainties materialize or such assumptions prove incorrect, our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially and negatively affected. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology including “anticipates,” “believes,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “should,” “will,” “would” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated include those set forth in the section below titled “Risk Factors,” including, without limitation, risks relating to:

· | the results of our research and development activities, including uncertainties relating to the discovery of potential product candidates and the preclinical and clinical testing of our product candidates; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the early stage of our product candidates presently under development; 
· | our need for substantial additional funds in order to continue our operations, and the uncertainty of whether we will be able to obtain the funding we need; 
· | our ability to obtain and, if obtained, maintain regulatory approval of our current product candidates, and any of our other future product candidates, and any related restrictions, limitations, and/or warnings in the label of any approved product candidate;
· | our ability to retain or hire key scientific or management personnel; 
· | our ability to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business, including patent and other intellectual property rights; 
· | our dependence on UM, third-party manufacturers, suppliers, research organizations, testing laboratories and other potential collaborators; 
· | our ability to develop successful sales and marketing capabilities in the future as needed; 
· | the size and growth of the potential markets for any of our approved product candidates, and the rate and degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates; 
· | competition in our industry; and 
· | regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries. 

 
We operate in a rapidly-changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. As a result, it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.
