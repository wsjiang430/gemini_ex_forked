Item 1. Business
Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.
General
Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. ("ELS"), a Maryland corporation, together with MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") and its other consolidated subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries"), are referred to herein as "we," "us," and "our." We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1993.
We are a fully integrated owner and operator of lifestyle-oriented properties ("Properties") consisting primarily of manufactured home ("MH") and recreational vehicle ("RV") communities. We were formed in December 1992 to continue the property operations, business objectives and acquisition strategies of an entity that had owned and operated Properties since 1969. 
We have a unique business model where we own the land upon which we provide our customers the opportunity to place factory-built homes, cottages or RVs either on a long-term or short-term basis. Our customers may lease individual developed areas ("Sites") or enter right-to-use contracts, which provide them access to specific Properties for limited stays. Compared to other types of real estate companies, our business model is characterized by low maintenance costs and low customer turnover costs. Our portfolio is geographically diversified across highly desirable locations with a focus on both retirement and vacation destinations. Our properties attract retirees, vacationing families and second homeowners, while providing a lower cost home ownership alternative. We have more than 90 Properties with lake, river or ocean frontage and more than 120 Properties within 10 miles of the coastal United States.
We are one of the nation's largest real estate networks with a portfolio, as of December 31, 2018, of 414 Properties (including joint venture Properties) consisting of 155,447 Sites located throughout the United States and Canada. These Properties are located in 33 states and British Columbia.

1. | Above map excludes five properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.

Our Properties are designed and improved for home options of various sizes and designs that are produced off-site by third-party manufacturers, installed and set on designated Sites ("Site Set") within the Properties. These homes and cottages can range from approximately 400 to over 2,000 square feet. Properties may also have Sites that can accommodate a variety of RVs. Properties generally contain centralized entrances, internal road systems and designated Sites. In addition, Properties often provide a clubhouse for social activities and recreation and other amenities, which may include swimming pools, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, pickleball courts, golf courses, lawn bowling, restaurants, laundry facilities, cable television and internet service. Some Properties provide utilities, including water and sewer service, through municipal or regulated utilities, while others provide these services to customers from on-site facilities. 
Employees and Organizational Structure
We have an annual average of approximately 4,100 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees dedicated to carrying out our operating philosophy while focusing on delivering an exceptional customer experience for our residents and guests. Our Property operations are managed internally by wholly-owned affiliates of the Operating Partnership and are coordinated by an on-site team of employees that typically includes a manager, clerical staff and maintenance workers, each of whom works to provide maintenance and care to the Properties. The on-site team at each Property also provides customer service and coordinates lifestyle-oriented activities for customers. Direct supervision of on-site management is the responsibility of our regional vice presidents and regional and district managers, who have substantial experience addressing the needs of customers and creating innovative approaches to maximize value for both customers and the Company through focused and effective property management. Complementing the field management staff are approximately 400 full-time corporate and regional employees who assist in all functions related to the management of our Properties.
Our Formation
Our Properties are primarily owned by our Operating Partnership and managed internally by affiliates of our Operating Partnership. We contributed the proceeds from our initial public offering in 1993 and subsequent offerings to our Operating Partnership for partnership interests. The financial results of our Operating Partnership and our Subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements, which can be found beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. In addition, since certain activities, if performed by us, may not be qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), we have formed taxable REIT Subsidiaries, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities.
Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI") is our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary engaged in the business of purchasing and selling or leasing factory-built homes that are located in Properties owned and managed by us. RSI also offers home sale brokerage services to residents at such Properties who choose to move from a Property without relocating their homes. Subsidiaries of RSI also operate ancillary activities at certain Properties, such as golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants. Several Properties are also wholly owned by our taxable REIT Subsidiaries.
Business Objectives and Operating Strategies
Our primary business objective is to create value for stockholders through effective management of Properties. Our operating strategy is to own and operate the highest quality Properties in sought-after locations near retirement and vacation destinations and urban areas across the United States. Through management of desirable Properties that provide an exceptional customer experience, we create communities valued by residents and guests while delivering value for stockholders.
We focus on Properties that have strong cash flow and plan to hold such Properties for long-term investment and capital appreciation. In determining cash flow potential, we evaluate our ability to attract high quality customers to our Properties and retain these customers who take pride in the Property and in their homes. Our operating, investment and financing strategies include:

• | Consistently providing high levels of services and amenities in attractive surroundings to foster a strong sense of community and pride of home ownership;


• | Efficiently managing the Properties to add value, grow occupancy, maintain competitive market rents and control expenses;


• | Achieving growth and increasing property values through strategic expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties;


• | Utilizing technology to evaluate potential acquisitions, identify and track competing properties and monitor existing and prospective customer satisfaction;


• | Selectively acquiring properties that offer opportunities for us to add value and enhance or create property concentrations in and around retirement or vacation destinations and major metropolitan areas to capitalize on operating synergies and incremental efficiencies;


• | Selecting joint venture partners that share business objectives, growth initiatives, and risk profiles similar to ours;

2


• | Managing our debt balances in order to maintain financial flexibility, minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations and maintain an appropriate degree of leverage to maximize return on capital; and


• | Developing and maintaining relationships with various capital providers.

These business objectives and their implementation are consistent with business strategies determined by our Board of Directors and may be subject to change or amendment at any time.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
We invest in Properties in sought-after locations near retirement and vacation destinations and urban areas across the United States with a focus on delivering value for both customers and stockholders. Over the last decade we have continued to increase the number of Properties in our portfolio (including joint venture Properties), from approximately 309 Properties with over 112,000 Sites to 414 Properties with over 155,400 Sites as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired eight Properties (four MH and four RV communities) with approximately 3,700 Sites. We continually review the Properties in our portfolio to ensure we are delivering on our business and customer service objectives.
We believe that opportunities for property acquisitions are still available. Based on industry reports, we estimate there are approximately 50,000 manufactured home properties and approximately 8,000 RV properties (excluding government owned properties) in North America. Most of these properties are not operated by large owner/operators, and approximately 3,600 of the MH properties and 1,100 of the RV properties contain 200 Sites or more. We believe this relatively high degree of fragmentation provides us the opportunity to purchase additional properties. We also believe we have a competitive advantage in the acquisition of additional properties due to our experienced management, significant presence in major real estate markets and access to capital resources. We are actively seeking to acquire and are engaged at any time in various stages of negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of additional properties, which may include outstanding contracts to acquire properties that are subject to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence review.
We anticipate that new acquisitions will generally be located in the United States, although we may consider other geographic locations provided they meet our acquisition criteria. We utilize market information systems to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, including the use of a market database to review the primary economic indicators of the various locations in which we expect to expand our operations. 
Acquisitions will be financed from the most efficient available sources of capital, which may include undistributed funds from operations, issuance of additional equity securities, sales of investments, collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities. In addition, we have acquired and expect to acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in our Operating Partnership ("OP Units") as consideration for the acquired properties. We believe that an ownership structure that includes our Operating Partnership has permitted and will permit us to acquire additional properties in transactions that may defer all or a portion of the sellers' tax consequences.
When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider, among others, the following factors:

• | Current and projected cash flow of the property;


• | Geographic area and the type of property;


• | Replacement cost of the property, including land values, entitlements and zoning;


• | Location, construction quality, condition and design of the property;


• | Potential for capital appreciation of the property;


• | Terms of tenant leases or usage rights;


• | Opportunity to enhance the customer experience and add value through management expertise;


• | Potential for economies of scale through property concentrations;


• | Potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;


• | Potential for expansion, including increasing the number of Sites;


• | Occupancy and demand by customers for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;


• | Prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;


• | Competition from existing properties and the potential for the construction of new properties in the area; and


• | Working capital demands.

When evaluating potential dispositions, we consider, among others, the following factors:

• | Whether the Property meets our current investment criteria;


• | Our desire to exit certain non-core markets and reallocate the capital into core markets; and


• | Our ability to sell the Property at a price that we believe will provide an appropriate return for our stockholders.

3

When investing capital, we consider all potential uses of the capital, including returning capital to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews the conditions under which we may repurchase our stock. These conditions include, but are not limited to, market price, balance sheet flexibility, other opportunities and capital requirements.
Property Expansions
Development - Current Portfolio. Integral to our growth and investment strategy, each Property is evaluated for expansion opportunities. Investment evaluation consists of: reviewing local market conditions, demographic trends, zoning and entitlements, infrastructure requirements, financial feasibility and projected performance and conducting an operational review. When justified, development of land available for expansion ("Expansion Sites") allows us to leverage existing facilities and amenities. We believe our ability to increase density translates to greater value creation and cash flow through operational efficiencies. Overall, approximately 110 of our Properties have potential Expansion Sites, offering approximately 5,200 available acres. Refer to Item 2. Properties, which includes detail regarding the developable acres available at each property.
Acquisition - Expanding Portfolio. In selecting acquisition targets, we pursue properties with existing operations in place and contiguous Expansion Sites. Underwriting a project with these features allows us to access the previously untapped potential of such properties. For example, over the past three years, we have acquired 15 Properties and two vacant land parcels that contain approximately 231 acres for future expansion.
Leases or Usage Rights
At our Properties, a typical lease for the rental of a Site between us and the owner or renter of a home is month-to-month or for a one-year term, renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in some instances, as provided by statute. These leases are cancelable, depending on applicable law, for non-payment of rent, violation of Property rules and regulations or other specified defaults. Long-term leases are in effect at approximately 10,900 Sites in 17 of our Properties. Some of these leases are subject to rental rate increases based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), in some instances allowing for pass-throughs of certain items such as real estate taxes, utility expenses and capital expenditures. Generally, adjustments to our rental rates, if appropriate, are made on an annual basis.
In Florida, in connection with offering a Site in a MH community for rent, the MH community owner must deliver to the prospective resident a Prospectus required by Florida Statutes Chapter 723.001, et. seq., which must be approved by the applicable regulatory agency.  The Prospectus contains certain required disclosures regarding the community, the rights and obligations of the MH community owner and residents, and a copy of the lease agreement. A Prospectus may contain limitations on the rights of the MH community owner to increase rental rates. However, in the absence of such limitations, the MH community owner may increase rental rates to market, subject to certain advance notice requirements and a statutory requirement that the rental rates be reasonable. See further discussion below related to rent control legislation. 
At Properties zoned for RV use, we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, who typically enter into short-term rental agreements. Many customers also leave deposits to reserve a Site for the following year. Generally, these customers cannot live full time on these Properties for reasons including their seasonal nature.
At Properties operated under the Thousand Trails brand designated for use by customers, who have entered a right-to-use or membership contract, the contract generally grants the customer access to designated Properties on a continuous basis of up to 14 days in exchange for annual dues payments. The customer may make a non-refundable upfront payment to upgrade the contract which increases usage rights during the contract term. We may finance the non-refundable upfront payment. Most of the contracts provide for an annual dues increase, usually based on increases in the CPI. 
Regulations and Insurance
General. Our Properties are subject to a variety of laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas, regulations relating to providing utility services, such as electricity, and regulations relating to operating water and wastewater treatment facilities at certain of our Properties. We believe that each Property has all material permits and approvals necessary to operate. We renew these permits and approvals in the ordinary course of business. 
Insurance. Our Properties are insured against risks that may cause property damage and business interruption, including events such as fire, flood, earthquake, or windstorm. The relevant insurance policies contain deductible requirements, coverage limits and particular exclusions. Our current property and casualty insurance policies, which we plan to renew, expire on April 1, 2019. We have a $100.0 million loss limit per occurrence with respect to our all-risk property insurance program including named windstorms. This loss limit is subject to additional sub-limits as set forth in the policy form, including, among others, a $25 million aggregate loss limit for earthquakes in California. The deductibles for this policy primarily range from a $500,000 minimum to 
4

5.0% per unit of insurance for most catastrophic events. For most catastrophic events, there is an additional one-time $500,000 aggregate deductible. A deductible indicates our maximum exposure, subject to policy limits and sub-limits, in the event of a loss.
Rent Control Legislation. At certain of our Properties state and local rent control laws dictate the structure of rent increases and in some cases outline the ability to recover the costs of capital improvements. Enactment of such laws has been considered at various times in other jurisdictions. We presently expect to continue to maintain Properties, and may purchase additional properties, in markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent related legislation exists or may be enacted. For example, Florida law requires that rental increases be reasonable, and Delaware law requires rental increases greater than the change in the CPI to be justified. Also, certain jurisdictions in California in which we own Properties limit rent increases to changes in the CPI or some percentage of CPI. As part of our effort to realize the value of Properties subject to restrictive regulation, we have initiated lawsuits at various times against various municipalities imposing such regulations in an attempt to balance the interests of our stockholders with the interests of our customers.
Membership Properties. Many states also have consumer protection laws regulating right-to-use or campground membership sales and the financing of such sales. Some states have laws requiring us to register with a state agency and obtain a permit to market (see Item 1A. Risk Factors). At certain of our Properties primarily used as membership campgrounds, state statutes limit our ability to close a Property unless a reasonable substitute Property is made available for members' use. 
Industry
We believe that demand from baby boomers for manufactured housing and RV communities will continue to outpace supply for several years. We also believe that our Properties and our business model provide an attractive destination for customers as they seek value in their housing and recreational options. Positive trends in categories such as customer demographics, the quality of MH construction and limited property supply, among others, fuel our belief that our Properties are well positioned for the future:

• | Barriers to Entry: We believe that the supply of new properties in locations we target will be constrained by barriers to entry. The most significant barrier has been the difficulty of securing zoning permits from local authorities. This has been the result of (i) the public's perception of manufactured housing, and (ii) the fact that MH and RV communities generate less tax revenue than conventional housing properties because the homes are treated as personal property (a benefit to the homeowner) rather than real property. Further, the length of time between investment in a property's development and the attainment of stabilized occupancy and the generation of revenues is significant. The initial development of the infrastructure may take up to two or three years and once a property is ready for occupancy, it may be difficult to attract customers to an empty property.


• | Customer Base: We believe that properties tend to achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following factors: (i) customers typically own their own homes, (ii) properties tend to foster a sense of community as a result of amenities, such as clubhouses and recreational and social activities, (iii) customers often sell their homes in-place (similar to site-built residential housing) resulting in no interruption of rental payments to us, and (iv) moving a Site Set home from one property to another involves substantial cost and effort.


• | Lifestyle Choice: According to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA"), in a survey conducted by the University of Michigan in 2011, approximately 8.9 million or 8.5% of U.S. vehicle-owning households owned an RV. The 77 million people born in the United States from 1946 to 1964, or "baby boomers", make up the largest and one of the fastest growing segments in this market. According to Pew Research Center in 2010, every day 10,000 Americans turn 65 years old. We believe that this population segment, seeking an active lifestyle, will provide opportunities for our future growth. As RV owners age and move beyond the more active RV lifestyle, they will often seek permanent retirement or vacation establishments. Site Set housing has become an increasingly popular housing alternative for retirement, second-home, and "empty-nest" living. According to 2018 U.S. Census Bureau National Population Projections figures, the population of people ages 55 and older is expected to grow 19% within the next 15 years.

We believe that the housing choices in our Properties are especially attractive to such individuals throughout this lifestyle cycle. Our Properties offer an appealing amenity package, close proximity to local services, social activities, low maintenance and a secure environment. In fact, many of our Properties allow for this cycle to occur within a single Property.

• | Construction Quality: The Department of Housing and Urban Development's ("HUD") standards for Site Set housing construction quality are the only federal standards governing housing quality of any type in the United States. Site Set homes produced since 1976 have received a "red and silver" government seal certifying that they were built in compliance with the federal code. The code regulates Site Set home design and construction, strength and durability, fire resistance and energy efficiency, and the installation and performance of heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. In newer homes, top grade lumber and dry wall materials are common. Also, manufacturers are required to follow the same fire codes as builders of site-built structures. In 1994, following the devastation left by Hurricane Andrew,

5

HUD introduced regulations that established different wind zones across the country. As a result, any homes set in place since 1994 must be able to withstand wind speeds of 70 miles per hour in Zone 1, 100 miles per hour in Zone 2 and 110 miles per hour in Zone 3. While most of the Unites States is designated wind Zone 1, areas most likely to be impacted by hurricanes are either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
Although construction of cottages, which are generally smaller homes, do not come under the same HUD regulations, they are built and certified in accordance with NFPA 1192-15 and ANSI A119.5 consensus standards for park model recreational vehicles and have many of the same quality features. RVIA operates a safety standards and inspection program that requires member manufacturers of all recreation vehicles, including park model RVs, to certify that each unit built complies with the requirements of the applicable standards. 

• | Comparability to Site-Built Homes: Since inception, the Site Set housing industry has experienced a trend toward multi-section homes. The average current Site Set homes are approximately 1,426 square feet. Many such homes have nine-foot ceilings or vaulted ceilings, fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms, and closely resemble single-family ranch-style site-built homes at a fraction of the price. At our Properties, there is an active resale or rental market for these larger homes. According to the 2017 U.S. Census American Community Survey, manufactured homes represent 9.1% of single-family housing units.


• | Second Home and Vacation Home Demographics: According to 2017 National Association of Realtors ("NAR") reports, sales of second homes in 2016 accounted for 31% of residential transactions, or 1.9 million second-home sales in 2016 and a typical vacation-home buyer earned $89,900 in 2016. According to 2014 NAR reports, there were approximately 8.0 million vacation homes in 2013 and a typical vacation-home buyer was 43 years old. According to the 2018 NAR reports, approximately 33% of vacation homes were purchased in resort areas. Of vacation buyers who purchased homes in 2018, 33% purchased in beach areas, 21% purchased on a lake front and 15% purchased in rural areas. According to the 2017 NAR reports, 18% of vacation home buyers plan to own their home for future retirement. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand from baby boomers. It is estimated that approximately 10,000 baby boomers will turn 65 daily through 2030. Additionally, the population of people age 55 in the U.S. and older is expected to grow 19% from 2019 to 2034. We believe these individuals will continue to drive the market for second-home sales as vacation properties, investment opportunities, or retirement retreats. We believe it is likely that over the next decade we will continue to see high levels of second-home sales and that homes and cottages in our Properties will continue to provide a viable second-home alternative to site-built homes. 

Notwithstanding our belief that the industry information highlighted above provides us with significant long-term growth opportunities, our short-term growth opportunities could be disrupted by the following:

• | Shipments: According to statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, MH shipments have increased each year from 2010 to 2018. Shipments in 2018 increased 3.98% to 96,600 units as compared to shipments in 2017 of 92,900 units. According to the RVIA, wholesale shipments of RVs decreased 4.2% in 2018 to approximately 483,700 units as compared to 2017, a small dip in the otherwise positive trend in RV shipments that started in late 2009.

• | Sales: Retail sales of RVs totaled approximately 436,440 in 2018, a 3.6% increase from 2017 RV sales of 421,436 and a 17.0% increase from 2016 RV sales of 373,032. We believe that consumers remain concerned about the current economy, and the potential for stagnant economic conditions in the future. However, the enduring appeal of the RV lifestyle has translated into continued strength in RV sales. RV sales could continue to benefit as aging baby-boomers continue to enter the age range in which RV ownership is highest. RV dealers typically have relationships with third party lenders who provide financing for the purchase of an RV.


• | Availability of financing: Although RV financing is readily available, the economic and legislative environment has generally made it difficult for purchasers of both manufactured homes and RVs to obtain financing. Legislation enacted in 2010 known as the Safe Mortgage Licensing (SAFE) Act requires community owners interested in providing financing for customer purchases of manufactured homes to register as mortgage loan originators in states where they engage in such financing. In comparison to financing available to purchasers of site-built homes, the few third party financing sources available to purchasers of manufactured homes offer financing with higher down payments, higher rates and shorter maturities, and loan approval is subject to more stringent underwriting criteria. In 2013, we entered into a joint venture, ECHO Financing, LLC, to buy and sell homes and purchase loans made by an unaffiliated lender to residents at our Properties. Please see our risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors and consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more detailed information.

In 2017, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA") published Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's Underserved Markets Plans for 2018-2020 (the "Plans") under the duty-to-serve provisions mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The FHFA mandate requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to serve three specific underserved markets, one of which is the manufactured housing sector. The Plans outline four duty-to-serve focus areas related to manufactured housing, including home purchase financing for customers placing manufactured homes in land lease communities. While this may have positive impact on our customers' ability to obtain chattel financing, the actual impact on us as well as the industry cannot be determined at this time.
