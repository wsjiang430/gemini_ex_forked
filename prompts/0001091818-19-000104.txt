ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
Corporate Background and General Business Overview

Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014 to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. We are a development stage company and also considered an Emerging Growth Company. Our fiscal year end is July 31st. We have an office located at Room 710A, 7/F, Ho King Commercial Centre, 2-16 Fa Yuen Street, Mong Kok, Kowloon, Hong Kong. On July 28, 2014 we purchased an office and small shop for US$8,000, located at: Jaunciema gatve 40, Ziemeļu rajons, Rīga, LV-1023, Latvia. Our primary activities will be carried out by our director residing in China, Qiuli Chen. She will be working from this location as her schedule permits, to process sales, oversee company operations in US, make sure our business plan in implemented as it should  including verifying that orders are fulfilled properly, regular office work (processing incoming mail, making phone calls to customers and suppliers, etc.) and working on our website content. Our President and CEO Riggs Cheung also oversees the implementation of the business strategy and is responsible for the development of new initiatives and future expansion of the Companys operations. 

We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute glass craft products, in forms including but not limited to glass crafts, novelties, knobs, trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays, plates. We currently have some operating history which includes revenues and cost of sales. Our plan of operations over the 12-month period is to continue to develop and grow our glass craft products distribution business and hire more salespeople (See Business of the Company and Plan of Operations). We are also actively looking to expand our business operations into the food and beverage industry, and other possible opportunities via our new subsidiary Real Capital Limited (a Hong Kong company) which was acquired on May 8, 2018.
 
From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities. We have generated some revenues and our principal business activities to date have consisted of creating a business plan and entering into a Supply Agreement, dated July 10, 2014, with three Chinese companies, Xiamen Ebei Import & Export Co., Ltd. (Xiamen Ebei), Yangzhou Kanglong Glass Arts Co., Ltd. (Yangzhou Kanglong), and Yancheng Sunrise Import & Export Co.,Ltd. (Yancheng Sunrise). Xiamen Ebei, Yangzhou Kanglong and Yancheng Sunrise are large and well-established suppliers and distributors of glass craft products in China. The terms and conditions of the Supply Agreement provide that, among other things, we have the right to purchase a variety of glass craft products (including crafts, novelties, knobs, trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays and plates) produced by each of the companies. The agreements also outline the following basic terms (see Agreements as filed in the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-1 for the full terms):

1.
 The term of each agreement began on August 1, 2014 and expires August 1, 2018. 
 2.
 Summit will give the Supplier (Seller) 60 days notice regarding the quantity requested for delivery. Supplier will arrange delivery through a carrier chosen by the Supplier, the cost of which shall be F.O.B.
 3.
 The agreement between Summit and the Supplier is non-exclusive.
 4.
 The prices to be paid by Summit under the Supply Agreements are fixed by agreement between Summit and the Supplier. Prices are exclusive of all taxes, insurance and shipping and handling charges which are Summits responsibility.
 5.
 Summit (and its customers) has the right to inspect the goods upon receipt and notify the Supplier of any claim for damages. If any defect or damages is identified the Supplier will replace or repair the goods or refunds the purchase price at the Suppliers option.

While we have entered into supply agreements with these three suppliers, we can make no assurance that we will be able to maintain these third-party relationships or establish additional relationships as necessary to support growth and profitability of our business on economically viable terms. As independent companies, these glass craft products suppliers make their own business decisions. Such suppliers may choose not to do business with us for a variety of reasons, including competition, brand identity, product standards and concerns regarding our economic viability. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they will produce and distribute the products we need for resale. In addition, their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer. 
 
We received the initial equity funding of $4,000 from our director (Sole Ex- chief executive) who purchased 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share. 
 
On January 29, 2015 the Company issued a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock to 30 independent investors for cash in the amount of $0.04 per share for a total of $40,000. 
 
On or about June 12, 2017, the shareholders of Summit Networks entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) with certain purchasers of such shares (Purchasers), which was approved by the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the SPA, the purchasers will purchase approximately 5,000,000 shares of the Summit Networks common stock (the "Purchase Transaction"). 
 
In connection with the purchase of the common stock the Purchasers and the Board of Directors has decided to reconstitute the Board of Directors and Executive Officers.
 
As of July 31, 2018 the Company had 6,104,999 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
 
Our financial statements from inception on July 8, 2014 through our fifth fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 reported $223,910 in revenues and a net loss of $136,266. Our financial statements from inception on July 8, 2014 through our fourth fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 reported $223,910 in revenues and a net loss of $41,449. 
 
Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern (see Financial Statements).
 
The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act). We intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As well, our election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they apply to private companies. Therefore, as a result of our election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Our Product
 
Brief History of Glass 
 
Glass is an inorganic solid material that is usually clear or translucent with different colors. It is hard, brittle, and stands up to the effects of wind, rain or sun.
 
Glass has been used for various kinds of bottles and utensils, mirrors, windows and more. It is thought to have been first created around 3000 BC, during the Bronze Age. Egyptian glass beads date back to about 2500 BC.
 
A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the "working period" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by George Ravenscroft in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. 
 
The mass production of glass was developed in 1887 by the firm Ashley in Castleford, Yorkshire. This semi-automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture
 
Our Products
 
Glass crafts unique designs in glass artwork and the superior products created from this magnificent glass have made it popular around the world. As well as traditional glass products, new, modern designs are developed by the factories and workshops to ensure glass craft products maintain their appeal. Handmade glass appears in many forms, including vases, wine and champagne glasses, plates, trays, baskets, fruit bowls and decanters. These beautiful items are perfect for wedding gifts, anniversary gifts or corporate gift or house décor item.
 
Glass craft products are known for their clarity, sparkle and transparency as well as for thin, shining, liquid-like quality and expert craftsmanship. Our mission is to bring our customers high quality glass craft products at a competitive price. Our suppliers, who represent the most advanced glass craft product manufacturers, agreed to supply us with many kinds of glass craft products. We transmit any orders received to our supplier for shipment. Our customers are responsible to cover the shipping costs. Shipping costs are added automatically to a customers final bill.
 
Potential customers
 
We currently sell our products to wholesale customers; we may in the future sell in the retail market. Our director, Ms. Qiuli Chen markets our products and negotiates agreements with potential customers in the USA. We use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to market our products and acquire potential customers. We plan to attend trade shows in our industry to showcase our product with a goal to find new customers. 
 
Competition
 
There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and retail sales companies selling glass craft products, such as HOBBY LOBBY (http://shop.hobbylobby.com/crafts-hobbies-and-fabric-crafts/glass-crafts/), JO ANN STORE (http://www.joann.com/crafts/basics/craft-supplies/glass-art/), D&L ART GLASS SUPPLY (http://www.dlartglass.com/), and DELPHI GLASS (http://www.delphiglass.com/more-crafts/), to name a few of the larger competitors.

We expect to face medium to high level of resistance in the market, where it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire new customers. Substantially all of our competitors have greater financial resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our competition varies by product line, customer classification and geographic market. The principal competitive factors in our industry are quality of product, pricing, service and delivery capabilities and availability of product. We compete with many local, regional and national glass craft products distributors and dealers. In addition, some glass craft products suppliers might sell and distribute their products directly to our customers, and the volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, distributors of products similar to those distributed by us, such as distributors of Chinese made glass craft products, may elect to sell and distribute to our customers in the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other distributors. 
 
Glass craft products are distributed by many companies as well as numerous stores and websites in the USA. To compete with other companies, we plan to use helpful customer service and offer a wide assortment of glass craft products at competitive prices. We will take significant efforts to promote our product using marketing and internet tools.
 
Website Marketing Strategy
 
To enhance our sales and to advertise our product we plan to keep improving and developing our website to make it as user friendly as possible. Our website will offer a large array of glass craft products and by becoming a one-stop shopping destination we believe this will significantly enhance the efficiency of the purchasing process, reducing the time and cost of finding reasonably priced glass craft products. Our online store will provide customers with an easy-to-use shopping alternative. The website will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week allowing customers to shop for our products directly from their homes or offices. We plan to provide a customer service department via email where consumers can resolve order and product questions.

Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We are required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
 
We do not believe that any existing or probable government regulation on our business, including any applicable export or import regulation or control imposed by China or USA in which we plan to distribute glass craft products will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. We intend to protect our website with copyright laws. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property.
Research and Development Activities and Costs
 
We have not incurred any research and development costs to date. We have plans to undertake certain research and development activities during the next 12 months related to the development of our website.
Facilities
 We currently own our physical property of our office and shop in Latvia.  Our current business address is Jaunciema gatve 40, Ziemeļu rajons, Rīga, LV-1023, Latvia. We also have an office at Room 710A, 7F, Ho King Commercial Centre, 2-16 Fa Yuen Street, Kowloon, Hong Kong. This office is provided for no charge by Dennis Cheung who is a related party of the Company. 
 Qiuli Chen (our director) and Riggs Cheung (our director, President and CEO), work on Company business from our office in Hong Kong.  This location serves as our primary office for planning and implementing our business plan.  Management believes the current premises arrangements are sufficient for its needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 
The primary activities at the Hong Kong location are carried out by our director Qiuli Chen . She is working from this location as her schedule permits, to process sales, oversee company operations in, make sure our business plan in implemented as it should  including verifying that orders are fulfilled properly, regular office work (processing incoming mail, making phone calls to customers and suppliers, etc.) and working on our website content. Mr. Cheung divides his time between the Hong Kong office and his residence in the U.S.A. 
 
We might use the Hong Kong shop later on to make some of our own brand assembly of glass craft products, but it will require more funds in the future. We first need to make our company successful by simply doing what we do best: the distribution of ready-made products from our suppliers.
 
Employees and Employment Agreements
 
We have no employees as of the date of this report.  Our director, Qiuli Chen, devotes as much time as the Board of Directors determines is necessary for him to manage the affairs of the Company.  As our business and operations increase, we will hire full time management and administrative support personnel.

Reports to Stockholders
 
We are required to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. You may obtain copies of these reports from the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. or on the SECs website, at www.sec.gov. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
 
We will also make these reports available on our website once our website is completed and launched.
 
Jobs Act
 
Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.
 We will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:
 
1. on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;
 
2. on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;
 
3. on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
 
4. the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.
 
A large accelerated filer is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:
 
1. it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter; 
 
2. It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and
 
3. It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act.

As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:
 
1. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;
 
2. Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
3. Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;
 
4. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and 
 
5. The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuers size.
 
Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY - THE JOBS ACT
 
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

 | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;


 | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


 | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements; and


 | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

 
We may take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies even if we no longer qualify as an "emerging growth company." 
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
 -10-
 

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
