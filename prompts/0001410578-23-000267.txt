Item 1.Business
Company Overview
We are a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic products that treat rare and orphan diseases for which there are currently no approved treatments or cures. Our initial focus is on the development of products, using our proprietary owned and in-licensed drug delivery technologies, that could help address rare skin diseases. Our first lead product is QRX003, a once daily, topical lotion comprised of a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, formulated with the proprietary in-licensed Invisicare® technology, is under development as a potential treatment fort Netherton Syndrome (“NS”), a rare hereditary genetic disease. QRX003 is currently being tested in two clinical studies in the United States (“U.S.”) under an open Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Dosing of patients has commenced for the first study, and we are preparing to commence enrollment into the second clinical study. We are also developing QRX004 as a potential treatment for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“RDEB”). In addition, we entered into Research Agreements with the Queensland University of Technology (“QUT”), under which we have obtained an option for global licenses to QRX007 for the potential treatment of NS and QRX008 for the potential treatment of scleroderma.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in 1986 under the name Montiger Ltd. Between 1986 and 2021, we underwent several name changes, including the name change to Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. (“Cellect”). On October 28, 2021, Cellect completed the business combination with Quoin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Quoin Inc.”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of March 24, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Cellect, Quoin Inc. and CellMSC, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Cellect (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Quoin Inc., with Quoin Inc. surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cellect (the “Merger”). Immediately after completion of the Merger, Cellect changed its name to “Quoin Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.” In addition, on October 28, 2021, Cellect sold the entire share capital of its subsidiary, Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., which retained all of Cellect’s then existing assets, to EnCellX Inc. (“EnCellX”), a newly formed U.S. privately held company.
Netherton Syndrome
NS is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a mutation in the SPINK5 gene and has an incidence of approximately 1/200,000 births. The SPINK5 gene encodes a protein, called lympho-epithelial kazal type related inhibitor (“LEKTI”) that serves as a brake system on the activity of certain proteases (enzymes that digest proteins) in the skin called Kallikreins. The absence of the LEKTI protein, as a result of the genetic defect that causes NS, leads to unregulated protease activity in the skin by the Kallikreins, resulting in too few layers of the outer skin (stratum corneum), thereby leading to a highly defective and compromised skin barrier. As a result, patients with NS suffer from a variety of medical issues including regular, severe infections, skin cancer, pruritis, asthma, and severe allergies among others.
Newborns with NS have reddened skin (erythroderma) and sometimes a thick parchment-like covering of skin (collodion membrane). The skin is red and scaly all over. Hair shafts are fragile and break easily due to trichorrhexis or “bamboo hair,” resulting in short sparse hair. In older children and adults the scaling may have a distinctive circular pattern (ichthyosis linearis circumflexa). Babies with NS may be born prematurely. Trouble gaining weight in infancy and childhood is common and can be severe. Infants may also have recurrent skin infections and septicemia. They may develop hypernatremia (elevated sodium levels in the blood) due to excessive loss of fluid from the skin surface. Because hairs may not be affected at birth, and then may be sparse in all babies in the first months of life, the characteristic hair defect that is diagnostic of NS may not be detected initially. Infants with NS may be misdiagnosed as having congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Atopic dermatitis (red, itchy patches of skin) may be present and a cradle cap-like scale and redness may appear on the face, scalp and eyebrows.
There are currently no approved therapies to treat NS. In the absence of an approved therapeutic product, patients can only obtain minor symptomatic relief, generally by the regular use of emollients and moisturizing creams and lotions. Other topical agents must be used with caution because the highly compromised skin in NS patients may allow ingredients from some topically applied medications to be excessively absorbed into the bloodstream, which may pose a danger to the patient. Use of topical keratolytic agents, such as urea or lactic acid derivatives, may be limited by skin irritation and is generally be reserved for older children or adults. Base line treatment may also include oral antihistamines, which can help to control the itchy, eczematous component, and topical or systemic antibiotics as needed. Oral and topical steroids and systemic biologics may be beneficial in reducing inflammation and the eczematous component of 

4



the disease. However, the well-documented side effects of long-term steroid use need to be carefully considered. There is a critical need for a new and effective treatment for NS.
Our Product Candidates
QRX003
QRX003 is a once-daily topical lotion being developed for the treatment of NS. The active ingredient in QRX003 is a competitive broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor whose mechanism of action is to target the kallikreins responsible for the process of skin shedding. As a result of the genetic mutation of the SPINK5 gene, that causes NS, these kallikreins go unregulated and become hyperactive resulting in the uncontrolled desquamation that leads to the highly defective skin barrier in NS patients. When applied daily to the skin, QRX003 is designed to perform the function of the missing LEKTI protein and down regulate, but not to completely stop, the activity of kallikreins, leading to a more normalized skin shedding process and the formation of a stronger and more effective skin barrier.
While several other companies are pursuing the development of products to treat NS, we believe, to date we are the only company that is conducting clinical trials in NS patients under an open IND with the FDA. In addition, we intend to pursue the clinical development of QRX003 in other rare dermatological diseases including Peeling Skin Syndrome, SAM Syndrome, and Palmoplantar Keratoderma. QRX003 was developed using Invisicare® polymer delivery technology licensed from Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Skinvisible”). See “—Intellectual Property—License Agreement with Skinvisible.” The Invisicare® polymer delivery technology moisturizes the skin whilst simultaneously providing a protective barrier against allergens, toxins and other environmental agents..
QRX004
QRX004 contains two active ingredients as a potential treatment for RDEB. One active ingredient induces a read-through of nonsense mutations and leads to creation of robust and sustained type VII collagen, which is designed to improve wound closure, reduce blistering and stronger skin. This product is being developed using Invisicare® delivery technology in-licensed from Skinvisible. See “—Intellectual Property—License Agreement with Skinvisible.”
QRX007 and QRX008
In November 2021, we entered into the Research Agreement with QUT, pursuant to which we have an option to in-license the QRX007 product. QRX007 is a bi-functional protein designed to be highly selective and potent inhibitor of the KLK5 and KLK7 kallikreins as a potential treatment for NS. QRX007 is in pre-clinical testing for NS. In May 2022, we entered into another Research Agreement with QUT, pursuant to which we have an option to in-license a small molecule VLA-4 inhibitor, the QRX008 product. QRX008 is a potential treatment for scleroderma, a rare autoimmune disease for which there is currently no approved treatment, and it is under early-stage development by QUT.
Regulatory Status of QRX003 for the Treatment of NS
On November 29, 2019, we submitted a pre-IND meeting request to the FDA regarding the proposed development of QRX003 as a potential treatment for NS. On January 30, 2020, we received feedback from the FDA, which we believe has provided us with a clear path forward for the development of QRX003 as a potential treatment for NS.
With regard to the proposed clinical program, the agency confirmed that in the case of a rare disease, findings from a single Phase 3 trial along with supportive data could be used to establish efficacy. In response to our query, the agency stated that QRX003 may be a candidate for one or more expedited regulatory approval pathways.
We submitted an IND in March 2022 to the FDA to initiate a clinical study of QRX003 in adult NS patients. We received a ‘Study May Proceed’ notification from the FDA on June 13, 2022, which cleared us to initiate clinical testing of QRX003 in NS patients. This study is fully up and running, and five of the projected six clinical sites in the U.S. have been opened. Patients are actively being screened and recruited into the study and dosing has commenced. This study is a randomized, double blinded assessment of two different doses of QRX003 versus a placebo vehicle in NS patients. The test materials are applied once daily, over a twelve-week period, to pre-selected areas of the patient’s body. Based on discussions with the FDA, a number of different clinical endpoints are being assessed in the study, including but not limited to, an Investigators Global Assessment (IGA), Patient’s Global Assessment (PaGA) and Pruritis. In its 

5



communication allowing our study to proceed, the FDA provided further feedback on our development program. The FDA provided advice on our initial study so that the study could better inform future studies.
In November 2022, we submitted a protocol for our second clinical study in NS patients to the FDA under our currently open IND. This study was cleared by the FDA to initiate in December 2022. We are currently enrolling patients into this study. This study will be conducted in ten NS patients who are currently receiving off-label systemic therapy, primarily systemic biologic therapy. This will be an open-label study with no placebo control.
Both of our NS clinical studies will run concurrently and utilize the same clinical trial sites and investigators. With regard to nonclinical studies to support further clinical development and an eventual NDA submission, the agency stated that the typical battery of toxicology studies would apply to this product candidate.
In March 2022, we submitted a briefing document to the EMA seeking guidance regarding the clinical and regulatory development of QRX003 for the European Union (“EU”), to which we received comprehensive and constructive feedback. We also intend to apply for Orphan Drug status in the U.S. and Europe as well as Rare Pediatric Disease designation in the U.S. for QRX003.
Commercial Strategy
QRX003 has the potential to become the first approved treatment for NS to reach the market both in the U.S. and Europe and may therefore likely be used in a large proportion of patients. We currently anticipate that QRX003, if approved, would be applied once daily to the diseased skin over the patient’s entire body. Because NS is a chronic disease and does not spontaneously resolve, we believe there is an opportunity for the product, should it be approved, for long-term chronic use.
We intend to self-commercialize QRX003, and other rare disease products the company may develop, if approved, in both the U.S. and Europe. Because of the very low number of patients and the fact that diagnosis and treatment are generally provided by a relatively small number of board-certified dermatologists in major urban areas, this concentration of care will enable us to market QRX003 with a small, dedicated salesforce to target patients and caregivers in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have currently established eight separate marketing partnerships for QRX003 that cover approximately 60 different countries including Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, Canada, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and some countries in Latin America.
Once the commercial infrastructure has been established for QRX003 for NS, the subsequent approval and addition of new rare disease indications or products will not result in a significant increase in the size of that infrastructure. In particular, it is highly likely that physicians who treat patients with NS would also treat patients with Peeling Skin Syndrome, SAM Syndrome, Palmoplantar Keratoderma and Epidermolysis Bullosa, enabling our sales personnel to discuss several products, once approved, with each treating physician.
A key element of our commercial strategy will be to add new products to our portfolio beyond those which we develop ourselves. This will be achieved through in-licensing, acquisition or the establishment of research partnerships with universities or other institutions. While it is intended that these products will treat rare and orphan diseases, we may widen our scope of interest beyond rare skin diseases as we believe this will not add significant incremental burden to an already established commercial infrastructure.
Pricing
We have not conducted a formal pricing analysis of QRX003 in NS. We anticipate that pricing at launch may be influenced by the product label negotiated with the FDA, pharmacoeconomic data developed to support pricing and the potential for greater sales under negotiated government contracts.
Competition
Currently, there are no approved products to treat NS. However, to our knowledge, there are a number of therapeutic products at various stages of development for the treatment of NS, including candidates from LifeMax Laboratories, Inc., Krystal Biotech, Inc., Sixera Pharmaceuticals, ResVita Bio, and Azitra Inc. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there are no active studies on NS patients being conducted under an open IND by any of these companies.

Manufacturing
Our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture our clinical and commercial active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product supplies. We currently have established manufacturing relationships with one API supplier and one drug product supplier and we are evaluating several other potential suppliers who manufacture raw materials and the drug substance used to create our product candidates. The availability of such suppliers to manufacture raw materials and drug substance for our product candidates in sufficient quantities for evaluation in preclinical or clinical studies or, if our product candidates are approved, for commercial supply may be limited.
The formulation and processes used to manufacture our products are proprietary, and we have agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers, such as Ferndale Contract Manufacturing and TopChem Pharmaceuticals Limited, that are intended to restrict these manufacturers from using or revealing any unpublished proprietary information.
Intellectual Property
Patents and Trademarks
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to develop and manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain.
The following table lists patents and trademarks that we use in our business.

License Agreement with Skinvisible
In October 2019, we entered into the Exclusive Licensing Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “License Agreement”) with Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Skinvisible”), under which Skinvisible granted us an exclusive royalty-bearing license relating to the production and manufacture of prescription drug products related to certain patents held by Skinvisible, including those related to QRX003 and QRX004. We made Skinvisible a one-time non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $1 million (the “License Fee”). In addition, we agreed to pay Skinvisible a single digit royalty percentage of our net sales revenues for any licensed product covered by the patent rights licensed to us under the License Agreement. We also agreed to pay Skinvisible 25% of any revenues we receive as royalties in the event that we sublicense any licensed products to a third party. The License Agreement also requires that we make a $5 million payment to Skinvisible upon receiving approval in the U.S. or the European Union, whichever occurs first, for the first drug product developed using intellectual property licensed thereunder.

Trade Secrets
In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, including processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although each of our employees agrees to assign their inventions to us through an employee inventions agreement, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology are required to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.
Regulatory
General
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous review under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal statutes and regulations.
FDA Approval Process
To obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, demonstrate in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for its intended use and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The drug approval process generally includes:

● | preclinical laboratory tests, in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies and formulation and stability studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an application for human clinical testing, which is known as an IND application;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) for a drug; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the approval by the FDA of an NDA.
--+-----------------------------------

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Preclinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with FDA and comparable foreign authorities’ legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, including Good Laboratory Practice. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. Before human clinical testing can begin, a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND, a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol 

8



amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators pursuant to protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. For each institution where a clinical trial will be conducted, an institutional review board (“IRB”) must review and approve the clinical trial protocol and informed consent form required to be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative prior to a clinical trial commencing, and conduct on-going monitoring of the study until completed or termination to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the human subjects participating in the research.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Imposition of a clinical hold may be full or partial. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1: In Phase 1 studies, the product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety, dosage and tolerability, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion and, effect on the body.
Phase 2: Phase 2 studies are conducted in a limited patient population. These studies continue to evaluate safety while gathering preliminary data on effectiveness in patients with the targeted disease or condition.
Phase 3: Phase 3 trials further evaluate efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient when either (1) the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) the single trial is supported by other confirmatory evidence.
Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gather additional information about a product’s safety and/or efficacy in patients affected by the therapeutic indication.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The submission of most NDAs is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee. Under an approved NDA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees typically increase annually. An NDA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the NDA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.
Pursuant to the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goals, FDA’s goal for acting on the submission of an NDA for a new molecular entity is ten months from the date the FDA files the NDA. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days after submission to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, before determining whether to file the NDA. This two-month preliminary review effectively extends the typical NDA review period to twelve months. In rare cases, the FDA may request additional information rather than file an NDA. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products, as well as pharmaceutical products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities 

9



at which the pharmaceutical product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the respective claimed indication.
Following the FDA’s evaluation of an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes the sponsor to begin commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. A CRL means that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may recommend actions that the applicant might take, including providing additional clinical data, such as an additional Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing, to resolve the deficiencies. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if the sponsor submits the recommended data and information, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
As condition to a product’s regulatory approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 studies designed to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, or may require other testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of the approved product. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to assure the safe use of the drug. A REMS could include medication guides, communication plans to healthcare professionals or other elements to assure safe use, such as provider certification or training, restricted distribution methods, and patient registries.
There are a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and requirements for obtaining marketing approval for pharmaceutical products outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the EU, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the United States.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologic products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides a six-month extension of any patent or non-patent exclusivity for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

10



Expedited Programs
FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drug products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.
Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of applications for approval of products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
Orphan Drug Designation
Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant special status, or orphan designation, to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or there is no reasonable expectation that the sales of the product will offset the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States. A request for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the NDA is submitted. Following the grant of orphan designation, FDA will publicly disclose the identity of the therapeutic drug candidate and its potential orphan use. Orphan designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a drug candidate with orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has orphan designation, the drug is entitled to a seven-year period of market exclusivity subject to certain exceptions (e.g., clinical superiority of a subsequent product). This means that FDA may not approve another drug application authorizing another manufacturer to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years. This does not preclude competitors from receiving approval of the same product that has orphan exclusivity for a different indication or a different product for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. The orphan designation of a drug also provides the sponsor with certain financial incentives including tax credits and waiver of PDUFA fees.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application.
A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by FDA; and the NDA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA approval, FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher.

11



To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA is a rare pediatric disease product application and grants priority review, and if the NDA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA a voucher upon approval of the NDA. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval.
The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or biologics license application (“BLA”) and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA.
The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the Creating Hope Reauthorization Act in December 2020, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2024 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to October 1, 2026.
Post-Marketing Obligations
All approved drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining approval for certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, maintaining and providing updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, criminal prosecution, or civil penalties.
The FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. These studies or trials may involve continued testing of a product and development of data, including clinical data, about the product’s effects in various populations and any side-effects associated with long-term use. The FDA may require post-marketing studies or trials to investigate known serious risks or signals of serious risks or identify unexpected serious risks and may require periodic status reports if new safety information develops. Failure to conduct these studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil fines.
Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and to list their products with the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad in order to assure compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations and other requirements. Facilities also are subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. In complying with the cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to assure that the product meets applicable specifications, regulations and other post-marketing requirements. Any third-party manufacturers must also maintain compliance with all applicable regulations and requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product.
Also, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, additional pre-clinical or clinical studies, or even in some instances, revocation or withdrawal of the approval. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA’s withdrawal of an approved product from the market, other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay or restrict further marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product or NDA holder, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development, or affect the conditions under which approved products are marketed.
Data Privacy
We are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal information. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. Certain privacy and data protection laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the 

12



California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), may not apply to us directly at this time, but those laws may apply to the investigators, health care professionals, third party payors, and business partners with whom we have relationships and so may apply to our processing of personal information that we receive from or share with such third parties. We may also engage service providers, such as contract research organizations, to process personal information on our behalf. We cannot ensure that all our contractors, vendors, licensees, business partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. The failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Commercial Product Pricing
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, many of the markets in which we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms.
In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class in certain cases. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this and other more recent legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that is provided for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act or other more recent legislation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Healthcare Reform
Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. Recently, healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) in August 2022, which will, among other things, allow U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2023, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is unclear to what extent additional statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented.
European Regulatory Authorities
In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may be marketed only once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

Environmental and Safety Laws
We do not use, handle, store, or dispose of hazardous materials and our operations do not produce hazardous waste. Accordingly, we are not subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Any waste generated is non-hazardous and is disposed of by third party contractors. Likewise, given that we have less than 10 employees, we are not subject to the recordkeeping requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) although other OSHA regulations may apply. OSHA and/or the Environmental Protection Agency may promulgate regulations that may affect our research and development programs.
We are also subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had four full-time employees and no part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage.
Enforceability of Civil Liabilities
To the extent any of our shareholders may seek to enforce a U.S. judgment in Israel against us or our executive officers and directors, or to assert U.S. securities law claims in Israel, shareholders may have difficulties enforcing such a U.S. judgment, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, in Israel.
We have been informed by our legal counsel in Israel that it may be difficult to assert claims under U.S. securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel or obtain a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws against us or our officers and directors because Israel may not be the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. Israeli courts might not enforce judgments rendered outside Israel, which may make it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us or our officers and directors.
Moreover, among other reasons, including but not limited to fraud or absence of due process, or the existence of a judgment which is at variance with another judgment that was given in the same matter if a suit in the same matter between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel, an Israeli court will not enforce a foreign judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the State of Israel.
