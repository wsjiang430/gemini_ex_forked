Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Brazil Minerals, Inc. with its subsidiaries ("Brazil Minerals", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") has two components to its business model: (1) growing a portfolio of mineral rights in a wide spectrum of strategic and sought-after minerals, from which equity holdings and/or royalty interests may develop, and (2) mining certain specific areas for gold, diamonds, and sand. We consolidate our results in this Annual Report.
 
Our progress as an exploration project generator has been steady. In early 2013 we owned mineral rights for gold and diamonds. Since then we have grown several-fold our bank of high-quality mineral properties (the "BMIX Mineral Bank") to currently include mineral rights for gold, diamonds, cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese, nickel, precious gems (aquamarine, beryl, tourmaline) and sand.
 
Our first equity holdings from our exploration project generation strategy is Jupiter Gold Corporation ("Jupiter Gold"). Jupiter Gold has been a public company since December 16, 2016. We owned approximately 51.7% of Jupiter Gold's common stock as of December 31, 2018 and own 49.3% as of April 10, 2019.
 
We operate our business through the following subsidiaries, with percentage ownership as per Exhibit 21.1: BMIX Participações Ltda. ("BMIXP"), Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. ("MDB"), RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. ("RST"), Hercules Resources Corporation ("HRC"), Hercules Brasil Comercio e Transportes Ltda. ("HBR"), Jupiter Gold Corporation ("JGC"), and Mineração Jupiter Ltda ("MJL").

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
Until December 31, 2017, we were deemed to be an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. Since our predecessor was incorporated in December 2011 and completed an initial public offering in June 2012, our status as an emerging growth company expired on December 31, 2017.
Markets
 
Rough Diamonds
 
The market for our rough diamonds is local and with demand from various buyers. Prices for rough diamond are set globally in U.S. dollars.
 
Polished Diamonds
 
The market for our polished diamonds is global and with prices normally quoted in U.S dollars. The price of our polished diamonds is determined by the so-called four C's – color, carat weight, clarity, and cut. We have had many of our polished diamonds certified and graded at the Gemological Institute of America ("GIA"), which is generally considered the premier analytical laboratory. The highest color grade our polished diamonds have obtained from GIA has been "E", the 2nd highest possible grade (the color scale starts at "D"). The best clarity that our polished diamonds have obtained from GIA has been "VVS1", the 2nd best clarity possible. The majority of our polished diamonds have been graded F-G for color and VVS2-VS2 for clarity. Their cut has been round brilliant, and their weight has been between 0.4 and 2.0 carats. The Rapaport valuation of our polished diamonds graded at GIA has been approximately $3,250 per carat. Rapaport is a diamond service provider that publishes well-known, periodic pricing valuations for diamonds based on the four C's, as described above.
Gold
 
The market for our gold is local with demand from various buyers. The price of our 96%-purity gold bars is determined by the global price for gold and quoted in U.S. dollars.

Sand
 
The market for our sand is local and priced in Brazilian reais. There are various local buyers for our sand, mostly owners of supply stores that cater to the construction industry. Our sand has been analyzed at a well-regarded analytical laboratory in Brazil and found to have high silica levels and low organic matter, both characteristics of high-quality sand.
Demand
 
When we have diamond and gold for sale, demand for our products has been robust. Demand for our sand is dependent on the health of the Brazilian economy since it is used in construction projects.
Distribution
 
We have not had material issues or bottlenecks with distribution of our products.
 
Competition
 
Diamonds, gold and sand production are difficult fields to penetrate due to regulatory requirements, long wait times for permitting and limited availability of new resource areas. We have had competition from illegal exploration of sand areas along the Jequitinhonha River, and we have notified the local authorities concerning such activities.
Seasonality
 
Our ability to mine for diamonds and gold is highly seasonal. The local rainy season lasts from December through April during which time open sky mining is reduced or stopped depending on the severity of the rains and storms. We expect that during this period our revenues will be substantially lower than during other periods.
Raw Materials
 
We do not have any material dependence on any raw material or raw material supplier. All of the raw materials that we need are available from numerous suppliers and at market-driven prices.
Intellectual Property
 
None which is material.
 
Government Regulation 
  
Mining Regulation and Compliance
 
Mining regulation in Brazil is carried out by the mining department, a federal entity, and each state in Brazil has an office of this federal entity. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the office of the mining department in the state in which such mineral right is located. We believe that we maintain a good relationship with the mining department and that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.
 
The mining department normally inspects our operations once a year via an unannounced visit which is their standard practice. We estimate that it costs $5,000-$10,000 annually to maintain compliance with various mining regulations.
 
Environmental Regulation and Compliance
 
Environmental regulation in Brazil is carried out by a state-level agency, which may have multiple offices, one for each region of the state. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the local office of the environmental agency that has the applicable geographical jurisdiction.  We maintain a good relationship with the offices of the environmental agency and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.
 
The environmental agency normally inspects our operations once every one or two years which is standard practice for companies in good standing. We estimate that it costs $20,000-$30,000 annually to maintain compliance with various environmental regulations.

Surface disturbance from any open pit mining performed by us is in full compliance with its mining plan as approved the local regulatory agencies. We regularly recuperate areas that have been exploited. The current environmental regulations state that after all mining has ceased (however long that may take), there would still be five years of available time for any necessary recuperation to be performed. Our mining and recovery processing for diamonds and gold does not use any chemical products. Tests are conducted regularly and there are no records of groundwater contamination.
 
Export Regulation
 
The export of rough diamonds from Brazil complies with the United Nations Kimberley Process certification system of which Brazil is a signatory country. This system was implemented to prevent entrance to the diamond marketplace of those gems produced in areas where human exploitation and other specific illicit activities exist. To our knowledge, Brazil was never a jurisdiction that had such issues.
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of April 10, 2019, we had 8 full-time employees. We also retain consultants to provide specific services deemed necessary. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
 
Form and Year of Organization & History to Date
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2011. From inception until December 2012, we were focused in the software business, which was discontinued when the current management team and business focus began. The Company changed name to Brazil Minerals, Inc. in December 2012.
