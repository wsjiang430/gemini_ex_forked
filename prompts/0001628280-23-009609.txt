ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
This business description should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by this reference.

Business Overview
Organization and Nature of Operations
Bright Mountain Media, Inc. is a holding company which focuses on digital publishing and advertising technology. The Company is engaged in content creation and advertising technology development that helps customers connect with, and market to, targeted audiences in high quality environments using a variety of digital advertising ("ad") formats.
Digital Publishing
Our digital publishing division focuses on developing content that attracts an audience and monetizes that audience through advertising. The current portfolio of owned and operated websites is focused on moms, parenting, families, and more broadly, women. The portfolio consists of popular websites including Mom.com, Cafemom.com, LittleThings.com, and MamasLatinas.com. This demographic is highly sought after by brands and their advertising agencies. We use internal and external technologies to constantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the content we create. Our publishing division monetizes its audiences through both direct and programmatic advertising sales. 
Advertising Technology
Our advertising technology division focuses on delivering targeted ads to audiences on owned and operated sites as well as third party publishers in a cost-effective manner through the deployment of proprietary technologies. Through acquisitions and organic software development, we have consolidated and plan to further condense key elements of the prevailing digital advertising supply chain by eliminating industry “middlemen” and/or costly redundancy of services via our ad exchange. By developing our own proprietary technology stack, we are able to pass along efficiencies to both the demand and supply side of the ecosystem. Our goal is to enable and support a streamlined, end-to-end advertising model that addresses both demand (buy side) and publisher supply (sell side) programmatic sales and delivery of digital advertisements using an array of audience targeting tools and advertising formats (display, audio, video, CTV, in-app). Programmatic advertising relies on artificial intelligence powered software programs that leverage data and proprietary algorithms to match the optimal selection of an ad with a bid price offered by advertisers.
The Company generates revenue through sales of advertising services which generate revenue from advertisements placed on the Company’s owned and managed sites, as well as from advertisements placed on partner websites, for which the Company earns a share of the revenue. Additionally, we also generate advertising services revenue from facilitating the real-time buying and selling of advertisements at scale between networks of buyers known as DSPs and sellers known as SSPs.
Market Challenge:
Current Advertising Model Reliant on Digital Advertising Supply Chain
According to eMarketer's report, "US Ad Spending 2022", total ad spending for 2022 in the U.S. was expected to reach approximately $345.99 billion, a 13.2% increase over 2021. We believe this estimate reflects the growth opportunities in areas such as search advertising and social ad spending beyond 2022.
According to eMarketer, U.S. digital ad spending has surpassed traditional media spending and is projected to reach over two-thirds of total media spending by 2023. With the migration of ad dollars to mobile devices, desktops and connected televisions, the digital advertising supply chain has evolved into a fragmented and complex ecosystem, forcing ad buyers to contend with hundreds, if not thousands, of touch points. Consequently, numerous specialized product and 
service providers now populate the ecosystem, standing in between brands and ad agencies and publishers and their media. Key players in the prevailing supply chain, whom we will refer to as “middlemen,” include:
•Advertiser ad servers: direct ads to their designated place in a publisher’s inventory when the correct impression opportunity is available.
•Ad networks: networks of relationships established between the buy and sell side to make the ad buying process easier and to expose more inventory and purchasing opportunities. 
•Ad exchanges: a web of ad networks, enabling real-time bidding transactions through a single source.
•Demand side platforms ("DSPs"): a platform that executes programmatic media buying, a form of buying in which inventory is purchased real-time to show one specific ad to one consumer in one individual context – including determining which media, how much to buy and at what price. Ad placement is bought on an individual impression basis, as opposed to being bought per thousand impressions ("CPM"). 
•Supply side platforms ("SSPs"): a platform that serves a similar function to a DSP, but on the sell side. It is a platform which publishers use to facilitate real-time bidding, as well as some direct buys. Its goal is to help advertisers purchase impressions more efficiently.
•Trading desks: the programmatic buying arm of an agency that aggregates programmatic, auction-based inventory across various DSPs and ad exchanges.
•Private marketplaces: an invitation-only marketplace that gives agency buyers access to premium inventory while using automated or programmatic buying methods to purchase faster, thus eliminating the RFP and negotiation process.
•Data management platforms ("DMPs"): a platform which stores, organizes and analyzes first- and third-party data to discover and reach target audiences. It then applies in-depth measurement to optimize media buying and creatives.
•Media management platforms: working alongside all the players in the ecosystem, media management companies provide tools to manage campaigns, automating every step of the advertising workflow, including planning, buying, analyzing, optimizing and invoicing.
•Measurement and analytics providers: these players aggregate and organize data so that marketers can get a holistic view of the campaign metrics they care most about.
•Data providers: they provide insight across the spectrum, from audience to pricing, so that marketers may make better ad buying decisions. Data is specifically used for targeting, segmentation, identification, verification and more.
Aside from frustration caused by managing so many disparate services and providers, advertisers face challenges that can be difficult to address within the prevailing ecosystem. For instance, advertisers may have difficulty ascertaining the value they receive for the ad dollars spent and lack certainty on how best to mitigate advertising fraud. Many advertisers may not have the resources necessary to neutralize or lessen the impact of ad-blocking software or have control over where their advertisements appear on the web.
Downstream, publishers may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to support their web pages and/or overall operations after the middlemen are paid their fees. 
The Solution:
Optimizing the Digital Advertising Supply Chain
Through Bright Mountain Media’s technology-driven platform, the supply chain is consolidated and condensed into a streamlined, end-to-end solution providing ad buyers and publishers with a sole source capable of delivering products and services to meet their respective needs and objectives without reliance on third-party providers. 
Building Our Platform
Since our founding in 2010, Bright Mountain Media has operated as a digital media holding company for websites in a variety of areas and sectors including the military and public safety sectors, curated entertainment, and parenting and families. In addition to our corporate website, we own and/or manage a portfolio of websites customized to provide our target users with products, information and news that we believe may be of interest to them. The current portfolio of owned and operated websites is focused on moms, parenting, families and more broadly women. In addition, up until December 2018, we operated ecommerce businesses, which we exited to focus exclusively on evolving our business into a full-service 
digital publishing and advertising technology and solutions company. Since August 2019, we have completed and vertically integrated three acquisitions as part of our business plan:
•Slutzky & Winshman Ltd. d/b/a/ S&W Media Group, which we subsequently rebranded as Oceanside Media (acquired in 2019);
•News Distribution Network, Inc., which we subsequently rebranded as MediaHouse (acquired in 2019); and
•CL Media Holdings LLC, d/b/a Wild Sky Media (acquired in 2020).
As consumers shift from traditional cable boxes to Internet-enabled devices and smart televisions, advertising budgets are following. CTV/Over-the-Top ("OTT") apps are presenting the opportunity for publishers to not only diversify revenue streams and capitalize on an influx of high CPM ad spends, but also to increase distribution by getting in front of a growing audience on numerous platforms. Leveraging Oceanside’s proprietary streaming technology; CTV/OTT app development and monetization experience; and 13 CTV/OTT apps offered on ROKU, Apple TV, Amazon Fire and Android TV; Bright Mountain Media has become a one-stop-shop helping existing publishers, content creators and influencers to access connected TV audiences via our SSP. We enable digital advertisers to reach engaged digital TV audiences while delivering impactful video ad formats and aligning their brands with premium vertical video content. Our focus is in developing proprietary video content for specific verticals; distributing that content; and securing deals with OTT companies providing for the pre-installation of our CTV/OTT apps on web-enabled televisions or through an Internet-enabled device, such as ROKU or Apple TV, connected to a conventional television.
Through Wild Sky Media, we own and operate parenting and lifestyle brands CafeMom, Mom.com, LittleThings, Revelist, BabyNameWizard and MamasLatinas. This portfolio of established multimedia websites enables Bright Mountain Media to build the next generation of brands that women can identify with while providing advertisers with a packaged target audience to market a broad range of premium branded products and services.
Our cloud-based platform, referred to as Bright Mountain Network and BrightX (Bright Exchange), also provides advertisers with additional built-in services including campaign planning and execution, data integration, optimization, ad placement verification, cross-device targeting and fraud detection, among other functions.
Moving forward, we plan to continue seeking complementary companies and technologies to acquire with a primary focus on DSPs, SSPs, ad exchanges, ad servers and DMPs. In addition, we plan to continue to implement organic growth initiatives centered on the design and development of software products that we believe will enhance and support our expanding platform and business operations – all capabilities that we believe will increase revenues and improve gross profit margin on sales.
We believe that our advertisers benefit from the high level of granularity, transparency and accountability our platform provides for their ad campaigns and marketing budgets. Publishers, including our owned and operated websites and CTV apps, benefit from capturing a larger share of the total ad spend. 
Industry Outlook
Impact on the U.S. Market
In April 2022, a report was published by Interactive Advertising Bureau ("IAB") titled "Internet Advertising Revenue Report, Full-Year 2021 Results," the report reflected that digital advertising experienced strong growth in 2021. During 2021, the industry was able to capitalize on the resurgence of marketing budgets throughout the year and the influx of isolated consumers who relied on digital media as their primary connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, U.S. digital ad revenue increased to approximately $189.0 billion or 35.4% between 2020 to 2021, the highest growth since 2006. The growth is nearly three times larger than the previous year's growth of 12.2% in 2021.
The IAB report states that the programmatic growth trend continued in 2021 as it grew 39.0% year over year and increased its share of overall non-search ad revenue to 89.2% (from 88.0% in 2020). 
Per the IAB report, the digital advertising ecosystem is increasingly vulnerable to evolving consumer privacy regulations and the decreasing ability to address audiences, which may slow the growth of ad monetization. Increased regulations, the evolution of new business and technical requirements, and ad platform upgrades by technology companies are decreasing both the size of addressable audiences and the ability to measure performance.
Impact on the Worldwide Market
In January 2023, eMarketer published a report titled "Worldwide Digital Ad Spending 2023". The report stated that global ad spending growth significantly declined in 2022, due to decreased consumer spending, but the results were not as 
negative as expected. The decline in ad spending primarily impacted social media, particularly Meta, and heavily challenged markets such as Western Europe and China. 
According to eMarketer's report, digital ad spending growth has significantly declined but is expected to reach 10.5% growth year over year in 2023. eMarketer estimated ad buyers spent approximately $37.0 billion less in 2022 than they predicted in previous forecasts. This was believed to be a result of reductions in social media spending, particularly Meta, and cutbacks in markets such as Western Europe and China. Total media ad spending worldwide is expected to increase by 6.9% year over year in 2023.
eMarketer estimated that advertisers will increase outlays by nearly $60.0 billion in 2023, and total spending remains on track to reach $1.0 trillion for the first time in 2024. It is expected that 99.2% of this new ad spending worldwide will go to digital, as set forth in the Digital Ad Spending Worldwide, 2021-2026 chart below.

Intellectual Property
We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information.
Technology and Product Platforms (Including URL’s)
Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages and ads to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic and network growth. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party content delivery network to achieve our goal of 24 hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.
Competition
The digital publishing and advertising industries are intensely competitive. We compete with other companies that have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and distribution resources. Our competitors include Verizon Media, AppNexus, Pubmatic, The Arena Group, Dot Dash Meredith, and Future PLC, among others.
Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry. There are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Our websites, ad technology, and monetization solutions may not be competitive with other technologies and/or our websites, ad technology, and monetization solutions may be displaced by newer technology. If this happens, our sales and revenues will likely decline. In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.
Customers
Our customers are advertisers, advertising agencies and advertising service organizations seeking to have their respective advertisements placed on one of the many platforms serviced by the Company.
Regulatory Environment
Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a user’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that user, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad that focus on consumer protection or data privacy. In particular, this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other technology to collect or aggregate information about Internet users’ online browsing activity. Because we, and our clients, rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies, it is essential that we monitor developments in this area domestically and globally, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect and how we use that data to provide our services.
We provide this notice through our privacy policy, which can be found on our website at www.brightmountainmedia.com. As stated in our privacy policy, our technology platform does not collect information, such as name, address, or phone number, that can be used directly to identify a real person, and we take steps not to collect and store such personally identifiable information from any source. Instead, we rely on IP addresses, geo-location information, and persistent identifiers about Internet users and do not attempt to associate this data with other data that can be used to identify real people. This type of information is considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of future legislation or regulation. The definition of personal data varies by country and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to avoid violating laws or regulations related to the collection, storage, and use of consumer data. For example, some European countries consider IP addresses or unique device identifiers to be personal data subject to heightened legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each country in which we do business.
There are also several specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data relevant to our business. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), imposes restrictions on the collection and use of data about users of child-directed websites. To comply with COPPA, we have taken various steps to implement a system that: (i) flags seller-identified child-directed sites to buyers, (ii) limits advertisers’ ability to serve interest-based advertisements, (iii) helps limit the types of information that our advertisers have access to when placing advertisements on child-directed sites, and (iv) limits the data that we collect and use on such child-directed sites.
The use and transfer of personal data in the European Union (the "EU") member states is currently governed under the EU Data Protection Directive, which generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. We have relied on alternative compliance measures, which are complex, which 
may be subject to legal challenge, and which directly subject us to regulatory enforcement by data protection authorities located in the EU. By relying on these alternative compliance measures, we risk becoming the subject of regulatory investigations in any of the individual jurisdictions in which we operate. Each such investigation could cost us significant time and resources, and could potentially result in fines, criminal prosecution, or other penalties. Further, some of these alternative compliance measures are facing legal challenges, which, if successful, could invalidate the alternative compliance measures that we currently rely on. It may take us significant time, resources, and effort to restructure our business and/or rely on another legally sufficient compliance measure. In addition, the EU has finalized the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2019. The GDPR sets out higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, as well as a greater compliance burden for us in the course of delivering our solution in Europe. Among other requirements, the GDPR obligates companies that process large amounts of personal data about EU residents to implement a number of formal processes and policies reviewing and documenting the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. Further, the EU is expected to replace the EU Cookie Directive governing the use of technologies to collect consumer information with the EU ePrivacy Regulation. The EU ePrivacy Regulation proposes burdensome requirements around obtaining consent and imposes fines for violations that are materially higher than those imposed under the EU Cookie Directive.
The United Kingdom’s (the "UK") decision to leave the EU may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts. If UK and EU privacy and data protection laws and regulations diverge, we will be required to implement alternative EU compliance measures and adapt separately to any new UK requirements. 
Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policy and our general consumer privacy practices are also subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission and state regulators, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations therein. Certain State Attorneys General may also bring enforcement actions based on comparable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. Outside of the U.S., our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business. 
Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data, including the IAB, the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative, and the Europe Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policy about our use of cookies and other technologies to collect consumer data, and of our collection and use of consumer data to deliver interest-based advertisements. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of interest-based advertising through a mechanism on our website, linked through our privacy policy as well as through portals maintained by some of these self-regulatory bodies. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to discipline members or participants, which could result in fines, penalties, and/or public censure (which could in turn cause reputational harm). Additionally, some of these self-regulatory bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory bodies. 
Human Capital
Because of the service nature of our business, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success and our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. We conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our companies. There is keen competition for qualified employees.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 57 employees, of which 36 were employed in the U.S. and 21 outside of the U.S., in Thailand and Israel. As of the filing of this Form 10-K our headcount was reduced to 52 employees. See Note 22, "Subsequent Events" of the consolidated financial statements.
We employ a balanced approach in managing our human capital resources. Depending on where a human-capital management function is most effective or efficient, processes are either managed at the holding company or designated to our operating units to adopt strategies appropriate for their client sector, workforce makeup, talent requirements and business demands. 
The holding company retains oversight of all human capital resources and activities, setting standards, providing support and policy guidance, and sharing programs. At the corporate center, centralized human capital management processes include development of human resources governance and policy; executive compensation for senior leaders across the Company; benefits programs; performance planning, development and retention of the Company’s senior executives and key roles in the operating units; and executive development. 
The Company sets specific standards for human capital management and, on a yearly basis, assesses each operating unit’s performance in managing and developing its workforce. We undertake human capital initiatives with an aim of ensuring that employees have the high level of competence and commitment our business needs to succeed. We formally assess our operating units against their efforts in the areas of people development, diversity and inclusion, performance management, talent acquisition and organization development in order to drive or support the units’ strategic business and growth goals. Accordingly, the operating units create and deploy skills-training programs, management training, employee goal-setting and feedback platforms, applicant-tracking systems, new-employee onboarding processes, and other programs intended to enhance the performance and engagement of the workforce. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are essential priorities for the Company. Our goal is that our talent represents the diversity of our communities and consumers, with a corporate culture that drives belonging, well-being and growth. We believe that such a workplace will enable us to provide cultural insights to help our clients make authentic and responsible connections with their customers. The programs we provide in support of diversity, equity and inclusion include, training and curated and bespoke content, research and tools, to foster awareness and action on an array of critical issues that we believe are vital for the recruitment, retention, advancement, well-being and belonging for people who are part of under-represented groups. 
History of Our Company
We were organized as a Florida corporation in 2010 under the name Speyer Investment Advisors, Inc. In 2012, we changed our name to Speyer Investment Research, Inc. In 2014, as we began building our brand, we changed our name to Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc. and in 2015 we changed our name to Bright Mountain Acquisition Corporation and then to Bright Mountain Media, Inc. as we began implementing our strategy to transform into a digital publishing and advertising technology holding company. During 2018, the Company decided to discontinue its e-commerce product sales segment to focus entirely on the advertising segment. In 2020, we acquired Wild Sky Media in the digital publishing area consistent with our strategy to focus on the advertising segment.
