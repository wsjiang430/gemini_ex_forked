Item 1.        BUSINESS
Our Company
American Woodmark Corporation (“American Woodmark,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division. We operated privately until 1986 when we became a public company through a registered public offering of common stock.
We manufacture and distribute kitchen, bath and home organization products for the remodeling and new home construction markets. Our products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers and builders and through a network of independent dealers and distributors. We presently operate 18 manufacturing facilities and eight primary service centers across the country and Mexico.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website, www.americanwoodmark.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The contents of our website are not, however, part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.
Our Business
Our business offers made-to-order cabinetry in over 550 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles. These cabinets are offered in a broad range of sizes, construction and decorative options to achieve a wide array of design layouts. To satisfy the fashion and style needs of the market place we offer over 100 door designs with a targeted range of painted or stained finishes, or engineered finishes under the Duraform® mark; on fronts made in a variety of wood species, including maple, cherry and oak as well as engineered materials.  
Additionally, we offer value-based assembled cabinet products for stock kitchen and bath, ready-to-assemble cabinetry for home organization, countertops and accessories.  These lines are available in a more targeted finish and door style assortment, and include hundreds of products appropriate for home centers, builders, dealers and remodeling contractors.  
Our products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark®, Timberlake®, Shenandoah Cabinetry®, Waypoint Living Spaces®, Estate by RSI®, Continental Cabinets®, VillaBath by RSI®, Stor-It-All® and Professional Cabinet Solutions®. Products are also sold under key customer’s private label brands, such as Hampton Bay®, Glacier Bay®, Style Selections®, Allen + Roth®, Home Decorators Collection and Project Source.
Our Products 
We offer a wide variety of products that fall into product lines including kitchen cabinetry, bath cabinetry, office cabinetry, home organization and hardware. Our cabinetry products are available in a variety of designs, finishes and finish colors and door styles. 
We offer products in the following categories: made-to-order and stock. Stock products represent cash and carry products sold through home centers. Made-to-order products typically utilize higher grade materials with more options as compared to stock and are all special ordered and shipped directly to the home from the factory. Our home organization products are exclusively stock products. Our kitchen cabinetry and bath cabinetry are offered across all product categories (made-to-order and stock) and our office cabinetry is offered as stock. Our stock products are sold through home centers, while our made-to-order products are sold through home centers, builders and independent dealers and distributors. 
Our Market 
Our products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets. We service these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors. We distribute our products to each market channel directly from our assembly plants and through a third party logistics network.
Our Customers 
We serve three main categories of customers: home center customers, builders and independent dealers and distributors.

Home Center Customers 
Contractors, builders, remodelers and do-it-yourself homeowners use our products primarily for repair and remodel (“R&R”) projects. Products for R&R projects are predominately purchased through home centers such as Home Depot and Lowe’s. Due to the market presence, store network and customer reach of these large home centers, our strategy has been to develop long-term strategic relationships with both Home Depot and Lowe’s to distribute our products. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), Home Depot and Lowe’s accounted for approximately 47.9% of net sales of the Company. The loss of either Home Depot or Lowe’s as a customer would have a material adverse effect on us.
Builders
The builder business represents a large portion of our overall revenue and has historically been a strategic component of our go-to-market strategy. We serve the majority of the top U.S. builders with a high degree of geographic concentration around major metro areas where single family starts are most robust. We also serve multi-family builders, primarily in the Southern California metro area. Our various service center locations serve the function of being close to this business and enable us to deliver exceptional service to our builder partners. 
Independent Dealers & Distributors
In 2010, we expanded our business into the dealer channel with the launch of the Waypoint Living Spaces® brand. Today, we sell this brand to over 1,300 regional and local dealers across the country. The dealer channel of the market is the largest by volume, characterized by a high degree of entrepreneurship and one that rewards suppliers that deliver great service. Our ability to provide superior value delivered with exceptional service has helped drive our expansion into this channel and will continue to be a strong growth and market share opportunity for us. Within our distributor channel we also sell our Timberlake® brand through a network of regional distributors who are focused on selling a complete variety of building materials to small and midsized builders and contractors within their local markets.  
Manufacturing, Distribution and Service 
Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located to serve our customers, which enhances our ability to provide high quality, value priced products with low production costs. We manufacture our products across 18 facilities located in Maryland, Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky, Virginia, California, Texas, North Carolina and Tijuana, Mexico. The geographic distribution of our facilities throughout the United States, together with our third party logistics network for the American Woodmark business and beneficial freight arrangement with home centers, enable us to provide a “short supply chain” to our U.S. customers. The ordering patterns of Home Depot and Lowe’s, our two biggest customers, require suppliers to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand and to serve a large number (frequently hundreds to thousands) of stores. They impose strict logistics and performance criteria on us. The scale and strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities help us to meet these demands of the home center customers, as well as provide a logistics platform that we can leverage for builders and dealers. We distribute our products through distribution centers located in some of our manufacturing facilities and other third party locations to maximize efficiency. Our vertically-integrated production and assembly lines, standardized product construction and investments in automation have allowed us to continuously improve productivity and develop an expertise in wood processing and yield-maximizing technologies. We have standardized our raw material inputs and a number of our production processes, which reduces logistical requirements to manufacture and gives us increased economies of scale in sourcing these inputs. Certain of our inputs are also partially processed by our vendors, which reduces cost. In addition, our production of labor-intensive manufacturing and fabrication processes in our three Tijuana, Mexico facilities have enabled us to keep overall labor costs low while maintaining higher quality, greater speed-to-market and transportation cost advantage over Asian manufacturers. 
We provide complete turnkey installation services to our direct builder customers via our network of eight primary service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States in Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Arizona and California. 
We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and supply chains and assess opportunities to reduce costs and enhance quality. We strive to improve quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage cost inflation, including wages and employee medical costs. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers 
The primary raw materials used in our products include hard maple, soft maple, oak, cherry and beech lumber and plywood. Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, high density fiberboard, manufactured

components and hardware. We purchase these and other raw materials from more than one source and believe them to be readily available. We rely on outside suppliers for some of our key components and do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners. We source a portion of our components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in these arrangements, together with the differences in business practices, shipping and delivery requirements, and laws and regulations add complexity to our supply chain logistics and increase the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling. In addition, prices and availability of these components may be affected by world market conditions and government policies and tariffs.
Competition 
We operate in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional and national manufacturers. Most of our competitors compete on a local or regional basis, but others, like us, compete on a national basis as well. Our competitors include importers and large consolidated operations as well as relatively small, local cabinet manufacturers. Moreover, companies in other building products industries may compete with us. Competitive factors within the industry include pricing, quality, product availability, service, delivery time and relationships with customers. Our principal means for competition is our breadth and variety of product offerings, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach, competitive price points for our products and affordable quality. We are the second largest manufacturer of kitchen, bath and home organization products in the United States.
Environmental Matters and Regulatory Matters 
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of regulated materials into the environment. Permits are required for certain of our operations, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines or the entry of injunctions, or both. We may also incur liability for investigation and clean-up of soil or groundwater contamination on or emanating from current or formerly owned and operated properties, or at offsite locations at which regulated materials are located where we are identified as a responsible party. Discovery of currently unknown conditions could require responses that could result in significant costs. 
Intellectual Property 
We maintain trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. We sell many of our products under a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in our industry. We rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position. If we must litigate to protect our rights, we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations. To date, we have not relied on patents in operating our business. 
Seasonality 
Our business has been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. General economic forces and changes in our customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years. The costs of the Company’s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations. The Company has generally been able over time to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases.
Employees 
As of April 30, 2019, we employed approximately 9,300 full-time employees, with approximately 210 unionized employees in Anaheim, California. We believe that our employee relations and relationship with the union representing the employees in Anaheim are good. 
Our Competitive Strengths
Market Leader with Nationwide Manufacturing and Distribution Network
We believe our company holds the number two market position in the United States cabinet market with an estimated 10% market share. We are one of a select number of market participants with a national manufacturing and distribution footprint, including 18 manufacturing facilities and eight primary service centers across the United States and Mexico. Our operating footprint provides us an ability to service our builder, dealer and home center customers on a national basis, and we offer a broad set of products to serve our customers across a variety of price points. Our facilities are primarily located in or near major metropolitan markets to

facilitate efficient product distribution to our customers. We believe the scale and breadth of our operations differentiate us and result in a competitive advantage providing superior customer service, low-cost distribution and on-time delivery.
Comprehensive Product Offering with Diversified End Markets
We believe that the diversity of our product portfolio across categories, channels and end markets benefits our financial performance, both in periods of growth and cyclicality. Our made-to-order offerings provide products for customers looking for a designer product, which can be used for both new home construction and remodeling applications. The addition of the stock offering allows us to further serve our existing end markets through the addition of a lower price point product that is well-suited for areas of growing demand such as new home construction targeting the first-time homebuyer. We also offer turnkey cabinet solutions for our builder customers which we believe is a unique aspect of our service platform. Our turnkey solution provides in-house design and measurement as well as installation service. We believe the ability to leverage our labor and expertise is a value-added service to our builder customers which has helped strengthen our position in the new home construction market.
Deep Relationships with Leading Retailers
We have built strong and stable relationships with a base of long-standing, customers across home centers, builders and independent dealers and distributors. We have an average relationship length of 20 plus years with our top 10 customers, including long-standing relationships with Home Depot and Lowe’s. We believe our customers value our national manufacturing and distribution footprint, which allows us to meet demanding logistics and performance criteria. We believe our focus on providing exceptional customer service and a quality product at a competitive price have enabled us to establish ourselves as a vendor of choice.
Best-in-Class Manufacturing Capabilities
We operate 18 manufacturing facilities across the United States and Mexico. Our vertically-integrated production and assembly lines, standardized product construction and investments in automation, have allowed us to continuously improve productivity and efficiency. We have standardized our raw material inputs and a number of our production processes, which reduces logistical requirements and provides increased economies of scale in sourcing these inputs. Our labor-intensive manufacturing and fabrication processes in Mexico offer a low cost alternative to Asian manufacturers, while providing a higher quality product with lower transportation costs. 
Experienced Management Team
We have assembled an executive team from leading organizations with a deep base of management experience within industrial manufacturing companies. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Cary Dunston, joined our team in 2006 and was named Chief Executive Officer in 2015 and elected Chairman in 2017. Mr. Dunston has a broad range of experience in manufacturing and supply chain management including the implementation of continuous improvement programs and lean manufacturing initiatives. Our team has identified and begun to execute on opportunities for operational improvement that has yielded increased profitability.
