Item 1.            Description of Business.
Definitions
 
The use of the words “CVD,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to CVD Equipment Corporation, a New York corporation incorporated on October 13, 1982, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CVD Materials Corporation (including its wholly owned subsidiaries CVD Tantaline ApS, and CVD MesoScribe Technologies Corporation) collectively “CVD Materials”), FAE Holdings 411519R LLC and 555 N Research Corporation except where the context otherwise requires.
Overview
 
CVD has served the advanced materials markets with chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor transport and thermal process equipment for over 40 years. We are headquartered in Central Islip, New York with other locations in Saugerties, New York and Nordborg, Denmark.
 
We design, develop, and manufacture a broad range of equipment to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for the compound semiconductor, semiconductor, aerospace, battery energy storage markets as well as advanced industrial applications, and research.
 
We conduct our business through three reportable operating segments: i) CVD Equipment that supplies chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor transport and thermal process equipment; ii) SDC that designs and manufactures ultra-high purity gas and chemical delivery control systems; and iii) CVD Materials that provide products related to advanced materials and coatings.
 
In January 2021, our Board of Directors appointed Emmanuel Lakios as President and Chief Executive Officer and directed him to evaluate our overall business strategy and operations to improve sales growth and return the Company to profitability. We continue to monitor the results of our growth and profitability initiatives, and we have taken actions as required to improve our results in line with anticipated revenue levels.
 
Key Company Strengths
 
Based on more than 40 years of equipment experience, we use our capabilities in process development, engineering, and vertical manufacturing to transform emerging applications into mainstream manufacturing solutions.
 
We have built a library of design expertise, know-how and innovative solutions to assist our customers in developing these intricate processes and to accelerate their production and commercialization. This library of equipment design solutions, along with our manufacturing and systems integration facilities, allows us to provide application-specific design, process, and manufacturing solutions to our customers.

Our core competencies in equipment and software design, manufacturing and process development are used to engineer our finished products and to accelerate the commercialization path of our customer base. Our proprietary real-time software allows for rapid configuration, and provides our customers with enabling tools to understand, optimize and repeatedly control their processes. These factors reduce cost, improve quality, and reduce the time it takes between customers’ orders and the shipment of our products. Our Application Laboratory allows customers the option to bring their process tools to our laboratory and to work collaboratively with our scientists and engineers to optimize process performance.
 
To expand our presence into our major target markets, we are developing a line of proprietary standard use products to complement our customized legacy systems. Historically, we manufactured products for research and development on an application-specific basis to meet an individual customer’s specific research and production requirements. Our proprietary systems leverage the technological expertise that we have developed through designing these custom systems into a broader standardized product line. The standard product line can be configured from a wide range of available options to meet diverse product and budgetary requirements. Manufacturing these standardized systems in higher volumes may provide us the flexibility to reduce both the cost and delivery time of our systems. These systems, which we market and sell under the CVD, FirstNano and EasyTube® product names, are sold to commercial companies, universities, research laboratories, in the United States and throughout the world.
 
Sales of our proprietary standard systems, custom systems and process solutions have been driven by our installed customer base, which includes many Fortune 500 companies. The performance and success of our products has historically driven repeat orders from existing customers as well as generated business from new customers. Furthermore, with our proprietary solutions and expanded focus on “enabling tomorrow’s technologies”TM we have been developing a new customer base in addition to growing with our existing customers.
 
Key Growth Strategies
 
Our core strategy is to focus on growth market applications in end markets related to the “electrification of everything” and aerospace. The phrase “electrification of everything” refers to the shift from fossil fuels to the use of electricity to power devices, buildings, electric vehicles (“EVs”), and many other applications. With respect to aerospace, our systems are being used by our customers to produce ceramic matrix composite materials (“CMCs”) that will be used in next generation gas turbine jet engines with the objective of reducing jet fuel consumption and contributing to the decarbonization of that industry.
 
Our current strategy has yielded multisystem orders to one company that manufactures silicon carbide wafers and a single system to another company that is working on battery nanomaterials. Both technologies are essential for the support of the EV market. These systems should provide us with standard product to continue to support the EV focused market as well as energy storage, power conversion and power transmission. We plan to expand our product offerings in the power electronics market to build off the success of recently introduced PVT150 system that is used to produce silicon carbide crystals for 150mm silicon carbide wafers. This planned expansion includes the development of the PVT200 system that would be used to produce silicon carbide crystals for the manufacture of 200mm wafers. Other products under development include an annealing furnace and epitaxy system, both of which are used in the manufacturing process of silicon carbide wafers.
 
   5

  

Also during 2022, we received an order from an aerospace company for a production chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) system that will be used to manufacture CMCs for gas turbine jet engines.
 
We have generally gained new customers through our industry reputation, as well as limited print advertising and trade show attendance which had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We began attending trade shows in 2022 and expect to expand our attendance at trade shows in 2023. In addition, we added to our sales and marketing team in 2022 and expanded our sales team in early 2023.
 
Major Target Markets
 
Our major target markets are high power electronics, EV battery materials / energy storage and aerospace and defense – all of which have the objective of improving energy efficiency.
High Power Electronics
 
Demand for silicon carbide wafers to support high power electronics for energy storage and transmission/charging resulted in a multi-system order from a US-based, silicon carbide wafer manufacturer. Through December 31, 2022, we have received orders for 30 of our PVT150 physical vapor transport systems from a customer, which uses our systems to grow silicon carbide crystals that are made into 150mm silicon carbide wafers for use in power electronics. During the second half of 2022, we initiated the marketing launch of the PVT150 on our website and at a leading trade show. We plan to expand our marketing and future product development for the PVT product line as well as expand our product offerings to manufacturers of silicon carbide wafers.
EV Battery Materials / Energy Storage
 
We have experienced increased interest and demand for nanotechnology materials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) to support the development and manufacturing for battery materials used in electric vehicles. We received two system orders in 2021 to deposit coatings onto powders used in silicon-graphite anodes, including a production system and a second for research and material development. Both systems were completed in 2022.

Aerospace & Defense
 
CVD is a leading manufacturer of CVI and tow-coating systems to manufacture CMCs for aerospace gas turbine jet engine applications. Our customers include two of the leaders in aerospace gas turbine engines. While the aerospace industry has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to industry forecasts, the demand for CMCs for jet engines is expected to grow in the future. Recently, there were announcements of airlines ordering airplanes that use CMCs in the gas turbine engines.
 
We continue to engage customers in the aerospace market in what we believe will be an eventual recovery in gas turbine jet engine demand. We believe that this will drive demand for CMCs for which we provide production solutions and have an installed base of systems. During 2022, we received an order for a production CVI system valued at approximately $3.7 million. The system will be used to manufacture CMCs for aerospace gas turbine jet engines. We believe this order may reflect the beginnings of a recovery in aircraft manufacturing as well as the need of jet engine manufacturers to develop more fuel-efficient engines.
 
We believe our future growth will be derived from production applications in our major target markets. Our legacy product line continues to provide advanced equipment and subsystems to enable development of emerging technology and research applications.
 
Our major targeted markets are further described as follows (the term “legacy product” refers to products and systems within our product offer that we have produced in our history) :

We develop new products based on market analysis or by customer request. The technology included in our product development includes mechanical hardware, software and controls systems and overall configuration. We have conducted research and development over the last 40 years and have a wealth of technology from which systems and solutions can be derived from and productized. Together with a number of leading universities and startup companies with whom we partner from time to time, we conduct research on SiC growth, the growth and infiltration of carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanowires as well as on selected aerospace manufacturing processes. Our intention is that together with customers and universities, we will leverage our collective expertise in this field, which we believe will allow us to capitalize on commercial opportunities in the future.
Products and Technology
 
Chemical Vapor Deposition/Infiltration – A method of coating or growing material through a chemical recombination at elevated temperatures onto or within pours of a substrate material. A single or collection of gases or vapor introduced on to the surface or into pores of a substrate material that is heated to such a degree that the gases decompose and deposits a desired layer onto and or into a substrate material. Chemical vapor deposition is the process of depositing or growing on a substrate and the process of depositing or growing material into the pours of materials. Both processes are accomplished by combining appropriate gases in a reaction chamber, of the kind we manufacture, at elevated temperatures (typically 500 to 2,500° Celsius). Our chemical vapor deposition systems are complete and include all necessary heating techniques, precise control instrumentation, gas delivery and abatement subsystems and components and include state-of-the-art proprietary process control software. We provide both standard and emerging applications specified products. Some of the standard systems we offer are for SiC, GaN, Aluminum Nitride (AlN), CMCs, silicon (Si), CNT, graphene, silicon nanowires. The systems are sold under the CVD and FirstNano product brands.
Physical Vapor Transport  (PVT) – While the PVT150 was officially launched for production in 2022, we have sold PVT systems in prior years and have pioneered both resistive heating and more effectively inductively heated PVT systems. The PVT150 system was specifically designed to address the SiC crystal growth market for 150mm substrates or wafers. It is at present our flagship product for the SiC market. Designed to provide enhanced process parameter control it allows existing and future customers the ability to tightly control and monitor the crystal growth process for 150mm substrates. A 200mm version is under development and planned for launch in 2023. The crystal growth technique utilized a high temperature furnace to vaporize from seed granular material of SiC and further deposit out in an ordered crystal structure onto substrate wafer. The process takes days to over a week to complete and yield a SiC crystal ready for further processing into wafers.
 
   11

  

Rapid Thermal Processing (“RTP”) – Used to heat semiconductor materials to elevated temperatures of up to 1,200° Celsius at rapid rates of up to 200° Celsius per second. Our RTP systems are offered for implant activation, oxidation, silicide formation and many other processes. We offer systems that can operate both at atmospheric and reduced pressures.
Annealing, Diffusion and Low-Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) Furnaces – These furnaces are used for dislocation removal in crystals, dopant diffusion, oxidation, for SiC, Si, SiOx and other applications. The systems are normally operated at atmospheric and/or reduced pressure with gaseous atmospheres related to the process. An optional feature of the system allows for the heating element to be moved away from the process chamber allowing the wafers to rapidly cool or be heated in a controlled environment. Our temperature control system enables more precise control of the wafers. The systems are equipped with an automatic process controller, permitting automatic process sequencing and monitoring with safety alarm provisions.
Ultra-High Purity Gas and Liquid Control Systems - Our standard and custom designed gas and liquid control systems, which encompass gas cylinder storage cabinets, custom gas and chemical delivery systems, gas and liquid valve manifold boxes and gas isolation boxes, provide safe storage and handling of pressurized gases and chemicals. Our system design allows for automatic or manual control from both a local and remote location. These subsystems and components are provided to the general market as well support the CVD Equipment segment.
Quartzware: The majority of our process equipment solutions, utilize quartz components which we partially manufacturer internally. In addition, the equipment typically requires routine maintenance, consumable and spare parts. One such spare part and consumable which is core to our technology offering is quartz hardware. We provide standard and custom fabricated quartzware used in our equipment and to a lesser extent for other customer tools.
Tantaline® Corrosion Resistant Coating - Tantaline® treatment is provided as part of either a finished product or as a service applied to customer sourced components. These include valves, fittings, fasteners, vessels, bellows, and a wide range of custom designed items. The Tantaline® treatment improves the corrosion resistance of these base stainless-steel parts extending the service life and increasing value in a wide range of applications.
MesoPlasma™ Direct Write Printing - A materials deposition process that provides robust direct write high-definition instrumentation, fine feature patterns, and coatings onto conformal components. The technique involves powder material that is injected into a thermal plasma where it is rapidly heated and deposited onto the substrate or component. The versatility of the process enables a wide range of materials to be deposited including ceramic dielectrics, nickel-based sensor alloys, metallic conductors, precious metals, and protective coatings. Products include temperature sensors, heaters, antennas and patterns per customer specifications. Since the acquisition of the MesoPlasma technology, the business has primarily been funded by external defense, government and private contracts.

Markets and Marketing
 
We serve multiple emerging and mature global markets including compound semiconductor high power electronics, aerospace, defense, battery energy storage, silicon and other microelectronic and micromechanical devices, semiconductor, universities, and research centers. Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we believe it is essential to engage with customers directly through our sales personnel, our network of domestic and international independent sales representatives, and distributors specializing in the type of equipment, products, and services that we sell. Our primary marketing activities include direct sales engagement, participation in trade associations and trade shows (that were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021) and our internet websites. The Company plans to expand its market activities in 2023 including attendance at key tradeshows and online marketing.
Customers
 
Our systems and products are used in both production applications and advanced materials research. We market and sell primarily to companies that are the engaged in producing compound semiconductor wafers, aerospace gas turbine jet engine component material, defense, battery energy storage, silicon and other microelectronic and micromechanical devices, semiconductor, universities and research centers. We have both a domestic and international customer base.
 
Given the complexity and magnitude of the systems we sell, revenue from a single customer in any one year can exceed 10% of our total sales. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer represented 29.2% of our revenues, while no customers exceeded 10% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. While we believe that our relationships with these customers are generally positive, the loss of a large customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $4.4 million or 17% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S., compared to approximately $4.3 million or 26% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Competition
 
We can experience intense direct competition from both domestic and international competitors in all our product segments. Our CVD Equipment product lines including FirstNano, target multiple markets and both production and research customers. Competition is substantial in both the production applications and research. In production application, competition comes from larger companies offering enhanced services, in research applications, the competition comes from small companies that compete with us mostly on price. We are aware of other competitors that offer a substantial number of products and services comparable to ours. Many of our competitors (including customers who may elect to manufacture systems for internal use) have financial, marketing and other resources greater than our own. To date, we believe that each of our product and service segments has been able to compete favorably in markets that include these competitors, primarily based on know-how, technical performance, quality, delivery, price and aftermarket support. We continue to focus on products, which serve markets that are growing and where we have a technical and commercially competitive advantage.
 
   13

  

CVD Equipment competes with companies located in Asia, Europe, and the US in in both the production and research market. In the production and research markets, we also compete with in customer in house-built equipment. Additionally, there are large, established companies who compete with us and pose a competitive risk in the market. Due to budgetary and funding constraints, many customers are price sensitive. We believe that our systems are among the most advanced available for the targeted market and coupled with our vertical integration in engineering and manufacturing, we believe that we can compete effectively.
 
SDC’s gas management and chemical delivery control systems are among the most advanced available. We further believe that SDC is differentiated from our competitors through our deep understanding of how the systems in which our products are incorporated are used in field applications. We have gained this understanding as a result of having designed and built complex process gas systems for our CVD Equipment group as well as for a number of the world’s leading semiconductor, aerospace, medical, solar manufacturers, research laboratories and universities.
 
CVD Materials consists of our Tantaline and MesoScribe subsidiaries. Tantaline has few competitors for a tantalum deposition corrosion coating due to the limited size of the market. There is no viable direct competitor for the MesoScribe services. There are technology competitors in the direct write applications and other additive manufacturing technologies competing for the same contracts and business opportunity.
 
Sources of Supply
 
Many of the components used in producing our products are purchased from unrelated suppliers. We have OEM status with our suppliers, but we are not obligated to purchase a pre-determined quantity. We are not dependent on a principal or major supplier and alternate suppliers are available. Historically, subject to lead times, the components and raw materials we used in manufacturing our products were readily obtainable. Presently, many of our suppliers have been adversely impacted by the ongoing supply chain disruptions due to the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia. This has led to longer lead times for purchasing materials and increases in the costs of many components.
 
We maintain a fully equipped machine shop that we use to fabricate a significant portion of our metal components in-house, including the most intricately designed parts of our equipment. We expanded our machine shop in 2022 to allow us to expand our ability to fabricate parts. Our quartz fabrication capability is currently sufficient to meet our quartzware needs. We believe our vertical manufacturing integration is a competitive advantage.
 
Materials procured from suppliers and/or manufactured internally undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure that the parts meet or exceed our requirements and those of our customers. Upon final assembly, all equipment undergoes a final series of complete testing to ensure maximum product performance.
 
   14

  

Backlog 
 
As of December 31, 2022, our backlog was approximately $17.8 million, compared to $10.4 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $7.4 million. Our backlog at December 31, 2022 consists of approximately $16.2 million remaining performance obligations for contracts in progress and the balance of approximately $1.6 million represents orders received from customers. We continue to work at diversifying our customer base away from any one customer as we focus on new opportunities with new and existing customers within our existing marketplaces and in new applications. The timing for completion of backlog varies depending on the product mix and can be as long as two years or as short as 30-60 days.
 
There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. The actual amount and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, such as cancellations and delays. As a result of these contingencies, we may adjust our backlog if we determine that such orders are no longer firm. In addition to adjustments from these types of contingencies, variations in backlog from time to time are attributable, in part, to changes in sales mix, the timing of contract proposals, the timing of contract awards, delivery schedules on specific contracts. As a result, we believe our backlog and orders, at any point in time, are not necessarily indicative of the total sales anticipated for any future period.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations, such as environmental, labor and export control regulations. We believe that we have obtained all necessary permits to operate our business and that we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us. These regulations change on an ongoing basis and the effect of these changes could materially impact our business in certain technology areas and regions.
 
Utilizing our in-house safety team, engineering expertise and consultants as required, we continue to monitor and comply with applicable Environmental Health and Safety regulations at our facilities as well as the installation of equipment at our customer facilities.
 
With respect to our sales to customers located in China or elsewhere outside the United States, products which (i) are manufactured in the United States, (ii) incorporate controlled U.S. origin parts, technology, or software, or (iii) are based on U.S. technology, are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). We continue to monitor, review, and maintain ongoing compliance with EAR with respect to our export sales.
 
Product Liability
 
Our products are used in our customers’ manufacturing processes, which in some cases contain explosive, flammable, corrosive, and toxic gases. There are potential exposures to personal injury as well as property damage, particularly if operated without regard to the design limits of the systems and components. Additionally, the end products of some of our customers are used in areas such as aerospace and high-tech devices where safety is of great concern. Management reviews its insurance coverage on an annual basis or more frequently, if appropriate, and we believe we have the types and amounts of insurance coverage that are sufficient for our business.
 
   15

  

Human Capital 
 
We consider our employees a vital asset to our business and strive to ensure we foster a work environment of respect, communication, objective orientation, and personal life balance. We believe this results in a higher level of employee satisfaction and hence improved performance and employment longevity. On December 31, 2022, we had 136 employees. We had 69 employees in manufacturing, 34 in engineering (including research and development and efforts related to product improvement) 4 in field service, 10 in sales and marketing and 19 in general management, maintenance and administration, compared to 111 employees as of December 31, 2021. None of our employees were subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
The implementation of our business strategy depends on our ability to hire, train, and retain qualified and diverse professionals, and we must emphasize employee development and training in order to do so. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of managers and intend to establish a strong succession-planning program for our critical positions, including internships for technical and engineering resources from local universities. Moreover, a key strategic focus of our management team is to foster and maintain a strong and healthy culture, where collaboration to achieve results and focus on the success of our customers and shareholders is paramount.
 
Employee Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees and partners is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. We maintain strong environmental, health and safety protocols that focus on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self-audits to ensure our colleagues and partners leave the workplace safely on a daily basis.
 
Our highest priorities throughout the pandemic were, and continue to be, the health and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers, and stakeholders. From the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken precautions to protect our employees, visitors, and customers while minimizing disruption to our business.
 
Employee Compensation
 
Management continues to review our employee compensation programs to better align the compensation of our employees with our objectives, performance, and personal performance, and to provide the proper short-term and long-term incentives to attract, retain and motivate them to achieve superior results. We believe we must offer wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and knowledge, and in order to do so we may work with a nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive and non-executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within our industry.
