ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Hudson Global, Inc. (the "Company" or "Hudson", "we", "us" and "our") is a leading total talent solutions provider operating under the brand name Hudson RPO. We deliver innovative, customized recruitment outsourcing and total talent solutions to organizations worldwide. Through our consultative approach, we develop tailored talent solutions designed to meet our clients’ strategic growth initiatives. As a trusted advisor, we meet our commitments, deliver quality and value, and always aim to exceed expectations. We are a Delaware corporation and have operated as an independent publicly-held company since April 1, 2003, when Monster Worldwide, Inc., formerly TMP Worldwide, Inc., spun off its eResourcing division.
Prior to the second quarter of 2018, the Company’s core service offerings included Permanent Recruitment, Contracting, and Talent Management Solutions (collectively, Recruitment and Talent Management or "RTM"), as well as Recruitment Process Outsourcing ("RPO"). On March 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its RTM businesses in three separate transactions and retained its RPO business (the "Sales Transaction"). The RTM businesses met the criteria for discontinued operations. The Company reclassified its discontinued operations for all periods presented and has excluded the results of its discontinued operations from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented.
The Company delivers RPO permanent recruitment and contracting outsourced recruitment solutions tailored to the individual needs of primarily mid-to-large-cap multinational companies. The Company's RPO delivery teams utilize state-of-the-art recruitment process methodologies and project management expertise in their flexible, turnkey solutions to meet clients' ongoing business needs. The Company's RPO services include complete recruitment outsourcing, project-based outsourcing, contingent workforce solutions, and recruitment consulting. Hudson has approximately 350 employees and operates directly in nine countries with three reportable geographic business segments: Hudson Americas, Hudson Asia Pacific, and Hudson Europe. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the amounts and percentages of the Company’s total gross profit from the three reportable segments were as follows: 

 | Gross Profit
$ in thousands | Amount | | Percentage
Hudson Americas | $ | 11,726 | | | 27.9 | %
Hudson Asia Pacific | 21,936 | | | 52.1 | % 
Hudson Europe | 8,442 | | | 20.0 | % 
Total | $ | 42,104 | | | 100.0 | %

The Company’s core service offering following the Sales Transaction is RPO, consisting of RPO Recruitment and RPO Contracting:
RPO Recruitment: The Company provides complete recruitment outsourcing, project-based outsourcing, and recruitment consulting for clients' permanent staff hires. Hudson's RPO Recruitment services leverage the Company's consultants, supported by the Company's specialists in the delivery of its proprietary methods to identify, select and engage the best-fit talent for critical client roles. 
RPO Contracting: The Company provides RPO clients with a range of outsourced professional contract staffing services and managed service provider services offered sometimes on a standalone basis and sometimes as part of a blended total talent solution. These services draw upon a combination of specialized recruiting and project management competencies to deliver a wide range of solutions. Hudson-employed professionals - either individually or as a team - are placed with client organizations for a defined period of time based on specific business needs.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the amounts and percentages of the Company’s total gross profit from the core service offerings were as follows:

The Company's consultant population has deep expertise in specific functional areas and industry sectors, and provides broad-based recruitment and solution services based on the needs of each client on a regional and global basis.
Competition
The markets for the Company's services and products are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants occur frequently, resulting in considerable market fragmentation. Companies in this industry compete on a number of parameters, including degree and quality of candidate and position knowledge, industry expertise, global presence, scalability, service quality, and efficiency in completing assignments. Typically, companies with greater strength in these parameters garner higher margins.
Growth Strategy
We focus on organically growing our RPO business, reducing overhead, and pursuing acquisition opportunities. We target driving organic growth in RPO by investing in people and technology to leverage our existing strong reputation in the market. We are driving down corporate and regional overhead by reducing complexity left over following the Sales Transaction. We are investigating acquisition opportunities to expand capabilities and capacity and utilize our net operating losses.
