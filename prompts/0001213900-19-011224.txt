ITEM 1 BUSINESS
General
 
Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”, “Elite”, “Elite Pharmaceuticals”, the “registrant”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc. (“Elite Labs”), was incorporated on August 23, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products and the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals. Our strategy includes improving off-patent drug products for life cycle management, developing generic versions of controlled-release drug products with high barriers to entry and the development of branded and generic products that utilize our proprietary and patented abuse resistance technologies.
 
We occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the “Northvale Facility”). The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) registered facility for research, development and manufacturing.
 
Strategy
 
We focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”); (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.
 
Our focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Drug Price Competition Act”) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.
 
We believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.

Filed products under FDA review
 
SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone
 
SequestOx™ is our lead abuse-deterrent candidate for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. SequestOx™ is an immediate-release Oxycodone Hydrochloride containing sequestered Naltrexone which incorporates 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg doses of oxycodone into capsules.
 
In January 2016, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx™, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, the Company received notification of the FDA’s acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) of July 14, 2016.
 
On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx™ NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form.
 
On July 7, 2017, the Company reported topline results from a pivotal bioequivalence fed study for or SequestOx™. The mean Tmax (the amount of time that a drug is present at the maximum concentration in serum) of SequestOxTM was 4.6 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. and the mean Tmax of the comparator, Roxicodone®, was 3.4 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. A key objective for the study was to determine if the reformulated SequestOxTM had a similar Tmax to the comparator when taken with a high fat meal. Based on these results, the Company paused clinical trials for this formulation of SequestOx™. On January 30, 2018, the Company reported positive topline results from a pilot study conducted for a modified SequestOx™ wherein, based on the results of this pilot study, the modified SequestOx™ formulation is expected to achieve bioequivalence with a Tmax range equivalent to the reference product when conducted in a pivotal trial under fed conditions. The Company has provided the pilot data to the FDA, requesting clarification as to the requirements for resubmission of the NDA. The FDA has provided guidance for repeated bio-equivalence studies in order to bridge the new formulation to the original SequestOx studies and also extended our filing fee waiver until July 2020. Due to the prohibitive cost of such repeated bio-equivalence studies, the Company has paused development of this product.
 
There can be no assurances of the Company conducting future clinical trials, or if such trials are conducted, there can be no assurances of the success of any future clinical trials, or if such trials are successful, there can be no assurances that an intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing, if made, will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA, and accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will earn and receive the additional $7.5 million or future license fees (see “Licensing, Manufacturing and Development Agreements; Sales and Distribution Licensing Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC for SequestOx™” below). If the Company does not receive these payments or fees, it will materially and adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues or profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.
 
Oxycodone Hydrochloride extended release (generic version of Oxycontin®)
 
On September 20, 2017, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for generic version of Oxycontin® (extended release Oxycodone Hydrochloride). OxyContin® is approved for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. IMS reported approximately $2.3 billion in revenue for OxyContin® and its equivalents in 2016. The FDA requested additional information relating to this filing, compliance with which would require significant resources. Development of this product is currently paused, with the Company evaluating the feasibility of the continued development of this product.

Generic version of extended release Central Nervous System stimulant
 
On May 24, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an extended release CNS stimulant. The ANDA represents the second filing for a product co-developed with SunGen under the SunGen Agreement. According to IMS Health data, the branded product and its equivalents had total U.S. sales of approximately $1.6 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The Company received a request from the FDA for additional information to which the Company has responded. The response is under review by the FDA.
 
Under the terms of the SunGen Agreement, the product will be owned jointly by the Company and SunGen. Elite shall have exclusive rights to market and sell the product under its own label. Elite will also manufacture and package the product on a cost-plus basis.
 
Please see the section below titled “Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC” for further details on the SunGen Agreement.
 
Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate
 
On September 18, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Tylenol® with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) 300mg/7.5mg, 300mg/15mg, 300mg/30mg and 300mg/60mg tablets.

Acetaminophen with codeine products have annual U.S. sales of approximately $45 million according to IQVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS Health Data).
 
There can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.

Discontinued and Transferred Products
 
The FDA’s Generic Drug User Fee Amendment (“GDUFA”) fee structure includes fee brackets that are based on the number of ANDAs owned as of the April 1st annual measurement date. As of the measurement date in 2018, The Company qualified as a medium sized company, which is defined as an entity that owns between 6 and 19 ANDAs. During the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, the Company received approval for several ANDAs, which, when added to those approved in prior periods resulted in the Company owning in excess of 19 ANDA’s and would have required classification as a large sized company as of the 2019 measurement date. Based on the latest fee schedule published by the FDA in August 2018, the annual fee for a large company is $1.1 million higher than the fee we paid as a qualified medium company. Qualifying as a large sized company would accordingly result in a significant increase in annual regulatory fees.
 
Prior to the April 1, 2019 measurement date, the Company conducted an evaluation of all ANDAs owned to determine the feasibility of incurring such increased annual fees in relation to the value and place of each ANDA in the company’s current and future operations and strategic plans. Based on this study, the Company identified the following ANDAs for sale and, if sale was not possible prior to the measurement date, discontinuance, so as to ensure that total ANDAs owned at the measurement date were not greater than 19, allowing the Company to qualify as a medium sized entity, as opposed to a large sized entity, which would have resulted in increased regulatory costs in excess of $1 million annually.
 
Hydroxyzine HCl
 
Approved ANDAs for Hydroxyzine HCl 10mg, 25mg and 50mg tablets (“Hydroxzine Tablets”) were sold to Epic Pharma LLC for cash consideration totaling $450,000. The three related approved ANDA’s had an aggregate carrying value of $787,000, with such sale resulting in a recognized loss of $337,000 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
 
Phentermine Capsules
 
Approved ANDAs for Phentermine 30mg and 15mg capsules and Phentermine 30mg seeded capsules were discontinued in March 2019. These three ANDAs had an aggregate carrying value of $291,000, which was recognized as a loss during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

As of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company has received $7.5 million of the $15 million in non-refundable payments due pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement, with such amount consisting of $5 million being due and owing on the execution date of the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement, and $2.5 million being earned as of January 14, 2016, the date of Elite’s filing of an NDA with the FDA for the relevant product. Both of these non-refundable fees (i.e., the $5 million fee and the $2.5 million fee), have been paid by Epic.
 
The remaining $7.5 million in non-refundable payments due pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement is due on the FDA’s approval of SequestOx™ for commercial sale in the United States of America (please see the paragraph below for further details). In addition, we will receive a license fee computed as a percentage (50%) of net sales of the products as defined in the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement and is entitled to multi-million-dollar minimum annual license fees we will manufacture the product for sale by Epic on a cost-plus basis and both parties agree to execute a separate Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. The license fee is payable quarterly for the term of the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement. The term of the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement is five years and may be extended for an additional five years upon mutual agreement of the parties. Elite can terminate the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement on 90 days’ written notice in the event that Epic does not pay us certain minimum annual license fees over the initial five-year term of the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement. Either party may terminate this 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement upon a material breach and failure to cure that breach by the other party within a specified period.
 
Please see the above section titled “SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone” for further details on this product and especially note that, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the NDA filed for this product has not been approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the 2015 SequestOx™ License Agreement has a five-year term, expiring on June 4, 2020, and Epic has previously advised the Company of their desire to extend this agreement. While discussions are ongoing, they are directly correlated to the regulatory status of SequestOx™. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that the parties will reach mutual agreement to extend the term of this agreement and no assurances that the terms and conditions of the agreement will be similar in all material aspects in the event that the agreement is extended by mutual agreement of the parties.

Products Under Development
 
Elite’s research and development activities include developing its proprietary abuse deterrent technology and the development of a range of abuse deterrent opioid products that utilize this technology or other approaches to abuse deterrence.
 
Elite’s proprietary abuse-deterrent technology utilizes the pharmacological approach to abuse deterrence and consists of a multi-particulate capsule which contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. When this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed. If the multi-particulate beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is designed to release. The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers.
 
We filed an NDA for the first product to utilize our abuse deterrent technology, Immediate Release Oxycodone 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg with sequestered Naltrexone (collectively and individually referred to as “SequestOx™”), on January 14, 2016. Please see “Filed products under FDA review; SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone” above and please note that continued development of this product is currently paused.
 
 On September 20, 2017, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for generic version of OxyContin® (extended release Oxycodone Hydrochloride). Please see “Filed products under FDA review; Oxycodone Hydrochloride extended release (generic version of OxyContin®” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product.
 
 On May 30, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an extended release CNS stimulant. The ANDA represents the second filing for a product co-developed with SunGen under the SunGen Agreement. Please see “Filed products under FDA review Generic version of extended release Central Nervous System stimulant” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product. Please also see the section below titled “Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC”.
 
On September 18, 2018, the Company filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the US Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for a generic version of Tylenol® with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) 300mg/7.5mg, 300mg/15mg, 300mg/30mg and 300mg/60mg tablets. Please see “Filed products under FDA review” above.  Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product.
 
On January 3, 2019, the Company filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the US Food and Drug Administration for a generic version of an antibiotic product. Please see “Filed products under FDA review” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product. Please also see the section below titled “Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC”.
 
The Company believes that the abuse deterrent technology can be applied to and incorporated into a wide range of opioids used today for pain management and has, to date, identified additional products for potential development. All of these products are at early stages of development, with research and development activities mainly consisting of in-house process development and laboratory studies. Extensive efficacy and safety studies, similar to those conducted for SequestOx™, Generic Oxy/APAP and Generic Hydrocodone/APAP, have not yet been conducted for these other products. As a result, costs incurred in relation to the development of these products have not been material.
 
Research and development costs were $7.6 million and $9.6 million for years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs incurred relate to the development of the abuse deterrent opioid product, SequestOx™ , the ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products in addition to a focus on clinical trials for generic products.
 
Please note that, while the FDA is required to review applications within certain timeframes, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurances that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to FDA regulation. Based on the foregoing, it is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product. In addition, there can be no assurances of the Company filing the required application(s) with the FDA or of the FDA approving such application(s) if filed, and the Company’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products incorporating its abuse deterrent technology is subject to a high level of risk as detailed in “Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Abuse-Deterrent and Sustained Release Opioids

The abuse-deterrent opioid products utilize our patented abuse-deterrent technology that is based on a pharmacological approach. These products are combinations of a narcotic agonist formulation intended for use in patients with pain, and an antagonist, formulated to deter abuse of the drug. Both, agonist and antagonist, have been on the market for a number of years and sold separately in various dose strengths. We have filed INDs for two abuse resistant products under development and have tested products in various pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies. Products utilizing the pharmacological approach to deter abuse such as Suboxone®, a product marketed in the United States by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Embeda®, a product marketed in the United States by Pfizer, Inc., have been approved by the FDA and are being marketed in the United States.
 
We have developed, licensed to Epic the marketing rights to SequestOx™, immediate release Oxycodone with Naltrexone, and retain the rights to the remainder of these abuse resistant and sustained release opioid products. We may license these products at a later date to a third party who could provide funding for the remaining clinical studies and who could provide sales and distribution for the product.
 
We also developed controlled release technology for oxycodone under a joint venture with Elan which terminated in 2002. According to the Elan Termination Agreement, we acquired all proprietary, development and commercial rights for the worldwide markets for the products developed by the joint venture, including the sustained release opioid products. Upon licensing or commercialization of an oral controlled release formulation of oxycodone for the treatment of pain, we will pay a royalty to Elan pursuant to the Elan Termination Agreement. If we were to sell the product itself, we will pay a 1% royalty to Elan based on the product’s net sales, and if we enter into an agreement with another party to sell the product, we will pay a 9% royalty to Elan based on our net revenues from this product. We are allowed to recoup all development costs including research, process development, analytical development, clinical development and regulatory costs before payment of any royalties to Elan.
 
Patents
 
Since our incorporation, we have secured the following patents, of which two have been assigned for a fee to another pharmaceutical company. Our patents are:
 

PATENT | EXPIRATION DATE 
------------------------------+--------------------
U.S. patent 6,620,439 | October 2020 
U.S. patent 6,926,909 | April 2023 
U.S. patent 8,182,836 | April 2024 
U.S. patent 8,425,933 | April 2024 
U.S. patent 8,703,186 | April 2024 
Canadian patent 2,521,655 | April 2024 
Canadian patent 2,541,371 | September 2024 
U.S. patent 9,056,054 | June 2030 
E.P. patent 1615623 | April 2024 
U.S. patent 10213388 | April 2030 

 
We also have pending applications for two additional U.S. patents non-provisional patents and one provisional patent application and one foreign patent application. We intend to apply for patents for other products in the future; however, there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications or other applications which we may file will be granted. We have also filed corresponding foreign applications for key patents.
 
Prior to the enactment in the United States of new laws adopting certain changes mandated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”), the exclusive rights afforded by a U.S. Patent were for a period of 17 years measured from the date of grant. Under GATT, the term of any U.S. Patent granted on an application filed subsequent to June 8, 1995 terminates 20 years from the date on which the patent application was filed in the United States or the first priority date, whichever occurs first. Future patents granted on an application filed before June 8, 1995, will have a term that terminates 20 years from such date, or 17 years from the date of grant, whichever date is later.

Under the Drug Price Competition Act, a U.S. product patent or use patent may be extended for up to five years under certain circumstances to compensate the patent holder for the time required for FDA regulatory review of the product. Such benefits under the Drug Price Competition Act are available only to the first approved use of the active ingredient in the drug product and may be applied only to one patent per drug product. There can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of this law.
 
Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention, or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country. Furthermore, even if our patents are determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology.
 
Trademarks
 
SequestOx™ is a trademark owned by Elite, for which United States trademark registration is being sought.


We currently plan to license at least some of our products to other entities in the marketing of pharmaceuticals but may also sell products under our own brand name in which case we may register trademarks for those products.
Terminated Agreements
 
Terminated Agreement – Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
 
On December 31, 2017, the Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
 
Other Business Factors and Details
 
Government Regulation and Approval
 
The design, development, and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds, on which our success depends, are intensely regulated by governmental regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, injunction actions and criminal prosecution based on products or manufacturing practices that violate statutory requirements. In addition, administrative remedies can involve voluntary withdrawal of products, as well as the refusal of the FDA to approve ANDAs and NDAs. The FDA also has the authority to withdraw approval of drugs in accordance with statutory due process procedures.
 
Before a drug may be marketed, it must be approved by the FDA either by an NDA or an ANDA, each of which is discussed below.
 
NDAs and NDAs under Section 505(b) of the Drug Price Competition Act
 
The FDA approval procedure for an NDA is generally a two-step process. During the Initial Product Development stage, an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for each product is filed with the FDA. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND is required by the FDA prior to the commencement of initial clinical testing. If the FDA does not comment on or question the IND within such 30-day period, initial clinical studies may begin. If, however, the FDA has comments or questions, they must be answered to the satisfaction of the FDA before initial clinical testing may begin. In some instances, this process could result in substantial delay and expense. Initial clinical studies generally constitute Phase I of the NDA process and are conducted to demonstrate the product tolerance/safety and pharmacokinetic in healthy subjects.
 
After Phase I testing, extensive efficacy and safety studies in patients must be conducted. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is filed, and its approval, which is required for marketing in the United States, involves an extensive review process by the FDA. The NDA itself is a complicated and detailed application and must include the results of extensive clinical and other testing, the cost of which is substantial. However, the NDA filings contemplated by us, which are already marketed drugs, would be made under Sections 505 (b)(1) or 505 (b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition Act, which do not require certain studies that would otherwise be necessary; accordingly, the development timetable should be shorter. While the FDA is required to review applications within a certain timeframe, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurance that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to FDA regulation. It is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product.

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities in any foreign country must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in that country. We intend to conduct all marketing in territories other than the United States through other pharmaceutical companies based in those countries. The approval procedure varies from country to country, can involve additional testing, and the time required may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general each country has its own procedures and requirements, many of which are time consuming and expensive. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed. After such approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before the products become commercially available.
 
ANDAs
 
The FDA approval procedure for an ANDA differs from the procedure for an NDA in that the FDA waives the requirement of conducting complete clinical studies, although it normally requires bioavailability and/or bioequivalence studies. “Bioavailability” indicates the rate and extent of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug product in the blood stream needed to produce a therapeutic effect. “Bioequivalence” compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another, and when established, indicates that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the active drug substance in the body are equivalent for the generic drug and the previously approved drug. An ANDA may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of a previously approved drug or, in the case of a new dosage form, is suitable for use for the indications specified.
 
The timing of final FDA approval of an ANDA depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the brand-name manufacturer is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA may be prohibited from accepting applications for, or approving, generic products. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on the patent expiration date.
 
In May 1992, Congress enacted the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992, which allows the FDA to impose debarment and other penalties on individuals and companies that commit certain illegal acts relating to the generic drug approval process. In some situations, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act requires the FDA to not accept or review ANDAs for a period of time from a company or an individual that has committed certain violations. It also provides for temporary denial of approval of applications during the investigation of certain violations that could lead to debarment and also, in more limited circumstances, provides for the suspension of the marketing of approved drugs by the affected company. Lastly, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act allows for civil penalties and withdrawal of previously approved applications. Neither we nor any of our employees have ever been subject to debarment. We do not believe that we receive any services from any debarred person.
 
Controlled Substances
 
We are also subject to federal, state, and local laws of general applicability, such as laws relating to working conditions. We are also licensed by, registered with, and subject to periodic inspection and regulation by the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and New Jersey state agencies, pursuant to federal and state legislation relating to drugs and narcotics. Certain drugs that we currently develop or may develop in the future may be subject to regulations under the Controlled Substances Act and related statutes. As we manufacture such products, we may become subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which regulates wholesale distributors of prescription drugs.

cGMP
 
All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale must be operated in conformity with cGMP regulations issued by the FDA. We engage in manufacturing on a commercial basis for distribution of products and operate our facilities in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we hire another company to perform contract manufacturing for us, we must ensure that our contractor’s facilities conform to cGMP regulations.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities, including the past practices of corporations as to which we are the legal successor or in possession. We do not expect that compliance with such environmental laws will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in environmental laws or regulations, administrative actions or enforcement actions, or remediation obligations arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Competition

We have competition with respect to our principal areas of operation. We develop and manufacture generic products, products using controlled-release drug technology, products utilizing abuse deterrent technologies, and we develop and market (either on our own or by license to other companies) generic and proprietary controlled-release and abuse deterrent pharmaceutical products. In both areas, our competition consists of those companies which develop controlled-release, abuse deterrent drugs and alternative drug delivery systems. We do not represent a significant presence in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
An increasing number of pharmaceutical companies have become interested in the development and commercialization of products incorporating advanced or novel drug delivery systems. Some of the major pharmaceutical companies have invested and are continuing to invest significant resources in the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies and some have invested funds in such specialized drug delivery companies. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources as well as more experience than we do in commercializing pharmaceutical products. Certain companies have a track record of success in developing controlled-release drugs. Significant among these are, without limitation, Pfizer, Sandoz (a Novartis company), Mylan Laboratories, Inc., Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., Amneal Laboratories, Inc., Mallinckrodt, and Aurobindo. Each of these companies has developed expertise in certain types of drug delivery systems, although such expertise does not carry over to developing a controlled-release version of all drugs. Such companies may develop new drug formulations and products or may improve existing drug formulations and products more efficiently than we can. In addition, almost all of our competitors have vastly greater resources than we do. While our product development capabilities and, if obtained, patent protection may help us to maintain our market position in the field of advanced drug delivery, there can be no assurance that others will not be able to develop such capabilities or alternative technologies outside the scope of our patents, if any, or that even if patent protection is obtained, such patents will not be successfully challenged in the future.
 
In addition to competitors that are developing products based on drug delivery technologies, there are also companies that have announced that they are developing opioid abuse-deterrent products that might compete directly or indirectly with Elite’s products. These include, but are not limited to Pfizer Inc., , Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Purdue Pharma LP
 
We also face competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include: (i) introduction of other generic drug manufacturers’ products in direct competition with our products under development, (ii) introduction of authorized generic products in direct competition with any of our products under development, particularly if such products are approved and sold during exclusivity periods, (iii) consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers and acquisitions and the formation of buying groups, (iv) ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or exclusivity periods, diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits, (v) the willingness of generic drug customers, including wholesale and retail customers, to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers, (vi) pricing pressures and product deletions by competitors, (vii) a company’s reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of quality products, (viii) a company’s level of service (including maintaining sufficient inventory levels for timely deliveries), (ix) product appearance and labeling and (x) a company’s breadth of product offerings.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Manufacturing
 
A significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including:

● | greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | interim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we currently obtain the raw materials that we need from over 20 suppliers, some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier, FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved.
 
We have acquired pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment for manufacturing our products. We have registered our facilities with the FDA and the DEA.
 
Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled “We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials and any delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products”.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
Each year we have had one or a few customers that have accounted for a large percentage of our limited revenues, therefore the termination or restructuring of a contract with a customer may result in the loss of material amount or substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new customers, but despite these efforts we may not, at the time that any of our current contracts expire, have other contracts in place generating similar or material revenue. We have agreements with Epic, Precision Dose and Ascend for the licensing, sales and distribution of products that we manufacture. We are currently renegotiating a licensing contract with Epic, which may result in the termination of an existing contract or an amended licensing contract that is materially different from that already in place. We receive revenues to manufacture these products and also receive a profit split or royalties based on in-market sales of the products. Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled “We depend on a limited number of customers and any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these customers or the loss of any of these customers could cause our revenue to decline.”
Our Reporting Segments
 
We currently operate in two segments, which are products whose marketing approvals were secured via an ANDA and products whose marketing approvals were secured via an NDA. ANDA products are referred to as generic pharmaceuticals and NDA products are referred to as branded pharmaceuticals. For the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 revenue from our ANDA segment was $6.6 million and $6.5 million respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 revenue from our NDA segment was $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
 
Segment information is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who we have determined to be the chief executive office, for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company. There are currently no intersegment revenues. Asset information by operating segment is not presented below since the chief operating decision maker does not review this information by segment.
 
Employees
 
As of June 14, 2019, we had 35 full time employees. Full-time employees are engaged in operations, administration, research, and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relationship with our employees to be good. However, our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continuing ability to attract, integrate, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel.
