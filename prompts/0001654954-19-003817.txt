 Item 1. Business.
  
  Our Company
  
 Manufactured Housing Properties Inc. (“MHPC”), together with its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries, are referred to herein as “we”, “us”, “our”, or “the Company”, unless the context requires otherwise.
  
 MHPC is a self-administered, self-managed, vertically integrated owner and operator of manufactured housing communities. The Company earns income from leasing manufactured home sites to tenants who own their manufactured home and the rental of Company-owned manufactured homes to residents of the communities.
  
 We originally incorporated in the State of Nevada as Frontier Staffing, Inc. on September 3, 2003. Since our incorporation, we have experienced several name changes and have engaged in several different business endeavors. On October 12, 2017, Mobile Home Rental Holdings LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company which engaged in acquiring and operating manufactured housing properties, merged with and into the Company. In connection with the merger, the name of the Company was changed to Manufactured Housing Properties Inc., the former business and management of MHRH became the business and management, respectively, of the Company.
  
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned and operated seven manufactured housing communities containing approximately 440 developed sites, and a total of 97 Company-owned manufactured homes. The communities are located in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
  
  The Manufactured Housing Community Industry
  
 Manufactured housing communities are residential developments designed and improved for the placement of detached, single-family manufactured homes that are produced off-site and installed and set on residential sites within the community. The owner of a manufactured home leases the site on which it is located and the lessee of a manufactured home leases both the home and site on which the home is located.
  
 Manufactured housing is accepted by the public as a viable and economically attractive alternative to common stick-built single-family housing. The affordability of the modern manufactured home makes it a very attractive housing alternative. Manufactured housing is one of the only non-subsidized affordable housing options in the U.S. Demand for housing affordability continues to increase, but supply remains static, as there are virtually no new manufactured housing communities being developed. MHPC is committed to be an industry leader in providing this affordable housing option and an improved level of service to its residents, while producing an attractive and stable risk adjusted return to our investors.
  
 A manufactured housing community is a land-lease community designed and improved with home sites for the placement of manufactured homes and includes related improvements and amenities. Each homeowner in a manufactured housing community leases from the community a site on which a home is located. The manufactured housing community owner owns the underlying land, utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities, and other capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community guidelines and maintenance of the community. Generally, each homeowner is responsible for the maintenance of his or her home and upkeep of his or her leased site. In some cases, customers may rent homes with the community owner’s maintaining ownership and responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of the home. This option provides flexibility for customers seeking a more affordable, shorter-term housing option and enables the community owner to meet a broader demand for housing and improve occupancy and cash flow.
  
 We believe that manufactured housing communities have several characteristics that make them an attractive investment when compared to certain other types of real estate, particularly multifamily, including:
  
   ●
 Significant Barriers to Entry. We believe that the supply of new manufactured housing communities will be constrained due to significant barriers to entry in the industry, including: (i) various zoning restrictions and negative zoning biases against manufactured housing communities; (ii) substantial upfront costs associated with the development of infrastructure, amenities and other offsite improvements required by various governmental agencies, and (iii) a significant length of time before lease-up and revenues can commence.

 
   ●
 Diminishing Supply. Supply is decreasing due to redevelopment of older parks.

   ●
 Large Demographic Group of Potential Customers. We consider households earning between $25,000 and $50,000 per year to be our core customer base. This demographic group represents about 43 percent of overall U.S. households, according to 2016 U.S. Census data.

 
   ●
 Stable Resident Base. We believe that manufactured housing communities tend to achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy, due to the following factors: (i) residents generally own their own homes; moving a manufactured home from one community to another involves substantial cost and effort and often results in the abandonment of on-site improvements made by the resident such as decks, garages, carports, and landscaping; and (iii) residents enjoy a sense of community inherent in manufactured housing communities similar to residential subdivisions.

 
   ●
 Fragmented Ownership of Communities. Manufactured housing community ownership in the United States is highly fragmented, with a majority of manufactured housing communities owned by individuals. The top five manufactured housing community owners control approximately 7% of manufactured housing community home sites.

 
   ●
 Low Recurring Capital Requirements. Although manufactured housing community owners are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure of the community, each homeowner is responsible for the upkeep of his or her own home and home site, thereby reducing the manufactured housing community owner’s ongoing maintenance expenses and capital requirements.

 
   ●
 Affordable Homeowner Lifestyle. Manufactured housing communities offer an affordable lifestyle typically unavailable in apartments, including lack of common walls, a yard for each resident, the ability to park by the front door, and a sense of community.

 
  Our Business Strategy
  
 Our business strategy is to acquire both stable and undervalued and underperforming manufactured housing properties that have current income. We believe that we can enhance value through our professional asset and property management. Our property management services are mainly comprised of tenant contracts and leasing, marketing vacancies, community maintenance, enforce community policies, establish and collect rent, and pay vendors. Our lot and manufactured home leases are generally for one month and auto renews monthly for an additional month.
  
 Our investment mission on behalf of our stockholders is to deliver an attractive risk-adjusted return with a focus on value creation, capital preservation, and growth. In our ongoing search for acquisition opportunities we target and evaluate manufactured housing communities nationwide.
  
 The Company may invest in improved and unimproved real property and may develop unimproved real property. These property investments may be located throughout the United States, but the Company has concentrated on the Southeast. We are focused on acquiring communities with significant upside potential and leveraging our expertise to build long-term capital appreciation.
  
 We are one of four public companies in the manufactured housing sector, but we are the only one not organized as a REIT, thereby giving us flexibility to focus on growth through reinvestment of income and employing higher leverage upon acquisition than the REITs traditionally utilize due to market held norms around 50-60%. This can give us a competitive advantage when bidding for assets. Additionally, due to our small size, non-institutional sized deals of less than 150 sites, which have less bidders and lower prices, are accretive to our balance sheet.
  
  Regulations, Insurance and Property Maintenance and Improvement
  
 Manufactured home communities are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations. We believe that each community has all material operating permits and approvals.
  
 Our properties are insured against risks that may cause property damage and business interruption including events such as fire, business interruption, general liability and if applicable, flood. Our insurance policies contain deductible requirements, coverage limits and particular exclusions. It is the policy of the Company to maintain adequate insurance coverage on all of our properties; and, in the opinion of management, all of our properties are adequately insured. We also obtain title insurance insuring fee title to the properties in an aggregate amount which we believe to be adequate.
  
 It is the policy of the Company to properly maintain, modernize, expand and make improvements to its properties when required.

 Recent Developments
 
 During the first quarter of 2019, we entered into agreements to acquire the assets of three manufactured housing communities totaling approximately $10,715,000. The three transactions will be accounted for as asset acquisition, and we expect to close them in the second quarter of 2019.
  
 In March of 2019, we refinanced a total of $4,920,750 from our current loans payable to $8,241,609 of new notes payable from five of our seven existing communities, resulting in an additional loan payable of $3,320,859. The Company used the additional loans payable proceeds from the refinance to retire our Convertible Note Payable of $2,754,550 plus accrued interest. $4,573,000 of the total $8,241,609, representing the refinancing portion for Azalea, Holly Faye, and Pecan Grove required a personal guarantee from our Chief Executive Officer.
  
 In January 2019, we agreed to acquire the 25% minority interest in Pecan Grove, and we will issue 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Gvest Real Estate for the minority interest acquisition which were valued at the historical cost value of $537,502.
