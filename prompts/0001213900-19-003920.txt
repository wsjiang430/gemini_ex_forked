Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a Cayman Islands company incorporated on February 5, 2018 as an exempted company with limited liability. We chose to incorporate in the Cayman Islands due to (i) its tax-neutrality, which allows international transactions to be structured efficiently without an additional layer of tax and (ii) simplicity of establishment and flexibility of administration, including easy migration to another jurisdiction, statutory procedure for merger or consolidation, and no takeover code or bespoke public company filing requirements.
 
Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 
We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business is not limited to a particular industry or geographic location. However, we believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on growing opportunities created by consumer/lifestyle assets that may have particular application for the PRC market (including traditional consumer staples characterized by lower cyclicality, such as food and beverages and household products; luxurious lifestyle products and retail brands, such as fashion, cosmetics, entertainment and leisure and other consumer discretionary products; E-commerce and online retailers; and sub-sectors within other high potential industries driven by retail sentiments and consumer demand such as consumer-focused pharmaceuticals, including sport nutrition, vitamins, dietary supplements, and other consumer-oriented healthcare services).
 
We believe our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that our professional contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, family offices, commercial and investment bankers, lawyers and other financial sector service providers and participants, in addition to the geographical reach of our affiliates, will continue to enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities. Our management believes that its collective ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives has been an essential driver of past performance and will continue to remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy. In addition, we believe our alliance with Symphony, which purchased from us, through an affiliate, an aggregate of 13,000,000 private warrants, will continue to allow us to potentially access/leverage relevant Asian distribution networks, enhance our insights into PRC consumer demand, and deepen our connections with leading relevant Asian trading houses.
 
However, past performance by our management team and Symphony is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Potential investors should not rely upon the historical record of our management or of Symphony as indicative of future performance.

Business Strategies
 
We deploy a proactive sourcing strategy, focusing on companies where the combination of the operating experience, relationships and capital markets expertise of our management team and Symphony can be catalysts to enhancing the overall value proposition of the potential target acquisition.
 
Among others, we believe the consumer/lifestyle sectors represent a particularly attractive deal sourcing ground that leverages both our team’s and our sponsor partner’s respective skill sets, and that could potentially serve as a strong platform for future bolt-on acquisitions. Our investment thesis, inter alia, is supported by the following trends:
 

(1) | China is expected to remain a major driver in global consumer demands, particularly in the luxury lifestyle sector. By 2018, retail sales in China may potentially surpass that of the United States for the first time to become the world’s largest consumer market. McKinsey, the global strategy consultancy, forecasts that fueled by rapid growth in per capita income especially in second and third-tier cities. China’s luxury consumers will grow from its present roughly one-third of the global luxury market to roughly 44% by 2025. Understanding and leveraging China market insights are key components of our consumer/lifestyle strategy and focus.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Consumer sentiments in China have become increasingly polarized. While a growing affinity towards local brands has been observed for goods such as sportswear and appliances due to rising national pride, selected high-profile Western brands remain a much-desired symbol of prestige, fashion and quality. As a result, we believe that branding strategies in China will require new levels of sophistication and precision in balancing these two trends. In this regard, we believe Symphony’s track record in formulating and implementing China distribution strategies for foreign brands will be particularly valuable.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | We anticipate certain categories of international consumer products may be better positioned to reap benefits from a China-oriented strategy than others such as:
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | Products already in a mature or near saturation phase in their home markets but with strong under-exploited growth potential in Asia, with nutritional/health foods in the US being but one such possible example;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Traditional undervalued or fatigued international fashion/lifestyle brands facing erosion of legacy value (due, perhaps, to loss of major licensing contracts, repeated failures to meet revenue targets, and/or unsuccessful product innovations, among others) that might be revamped and turned around through a fresh entrance into Asia’s developing markets, thereby extending their product lives; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Early entrants into the Chinese market encumbered by subsequent failed execution (due, perhaps, to lack of a strong local distribution partner, reputation damage from mismanagement, and/or failed localization initiatives), where fresh partners/leadership could successfully address such past challenges or correct any past failures.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | We anticipate that technology will be another key driver of potential opportunities in the consumer/lifestyle sector, such as where selected distressed retailers, under e-commerce pressure, might benefit from injection of a robust digitization/online strategy. In such cases, we may explore forming strategic alliances between acquired fatigued international consumer brands and leading Chinese e-commerce players as a viable next step to capture synergy and create value. By doing so, we expect to benefit from China’s fast growing e-commerce sector, which contributed to 42% of the global market in 2016, up from less than 1% in 2005.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | We anticipate deleveraging will remain an important theme for many of Asia’s major economies, particularly China and India. To the extent possible, we will seek to take advantage of such distressed situations by identifying and acquiring high-quality consumer business franchises from relevant over-leveraged conglomerates that might be available at a substantial discount, particularly in cases where our management or sponsor may have actionable relationships with such potential sellers.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Our objective is to generate meaningful returns through a disciplined strategy of underwriting intrinsic worth and affecting positive change to unlock value, with a priority focus on the consumer/lifestyle sector. Consistent with such objective, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines in evaluating potential target businesses:

(1) | Target businesses in the consumer/lifestyle sector that are potentially positioned to benefit from our industry networks and insights, or in other high-potential industries that can equally benefit from, inter alia, (a) the rebranding and optimization of distribution channels, (b) a rigorous Greater China execution and/or distribution strategy, and/or (c) application of e-commerce initiatives that can drive strong efficiency gains and/or improve staggered sales;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Target businesses that are available for sale at substantial discounts due to the deleveraging needs of their respective parent companies;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Target businesses that are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, have untapped potential for new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where acquisition through a publicly listed vehicle may help facilitate growth;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Target businesses that have recently been pressured by significant waves of devaluation whose growth potential can be re-animated through further related sector add-on acquisitions and complementary strategic alliances. In such cases, we may seek to create value through the simultaneous acquisition and merger of multiple targets with significant synergetic values. However, we do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination unless we believe a specific case can be made for such action;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Target businesses, in general, that suggest unrecognized and underpriced value; and/or
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Target businesses that will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. Financial returns will be evaluated based on (a) the ability to achieve cost savings, (b) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (c) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (d) the prospects of benefiting from other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from improvement in earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria and guidelines are not exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on the preceding criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant at the time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may complete a business combination with a target business that does not meet any of the preceding criteria and guidelines.
 
Financial position 
 
With funds in the trust account of $251,886,105 as of December 31, 2018 available to use for a business combination (assuming no stockholder seeks conversion of their shares or seeks to sell their shares to us in a tender offer in relation to such business combination), we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
On August 20, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 22,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, one half of one warrant, each whole warrant exercisable for one ordinary shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination, pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-226423 and 333-226859). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $220,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of 11,800,000 warrants, issued to an affiliate of Symphony, at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,900,000.

On August 22, 2018, the underwriters of our initial public offering exercised their over-allotment option in full and purchased 3,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $30.0 million. On August 22, 2018, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, we completed a private placement for an additional 1,200,000 warrants, issued to an affiliate of Symphony, at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $600,000.
 
$250.0 million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering (including the over-allotment) and the private placements with Symphony were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
 
Our units began trading on August 16, 2018 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol TKKSU. Commencing on September 12, 2018, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, ordinary shares and warrants are trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “TKKSU,” “TKKSC” and “TKKSW,” respectively.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this report, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our public filings and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction) other than the $15,000 per month administrative services fee, the repayment of any loans from our sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial shareholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. However, as of the date of this report, there is no affiliated entity that we consider a business combination target.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described above in more detail, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors in addition to those listed in the sections titled “Business Strategies” and “Acquisition Criteria,” above, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of its products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses, regardless of the location or industry in which such target business operates. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

Alternative structures to comply with regulations in certain Chinese industries
 
We may need to adopt alternative structures in the event that we elect to acquire a target company in certain Chinese industries. The Chinese government has restricted or limited direct foreign ownership of certain kinds of assets and companies operating in a wide variety of industries, including certain aspects of telecommunications, advertising, food production, and heavy equipment manufacturers. The Chinese government may apply these restrictions in other industries in the future. In addition, there can be restrictions on the foreign ownership of businesses that are determined from time to time to be in “important industries” that may affect the national economic security or having “famous Chinese brand names” or “well established Chinese brand names.” Subject to the review requirements of the Ministry of Commerce and other relevant agencies as discussed elsewhere for acquisitions of assets and companies in China and subject to the various percentage ownership limitations that exist from time to time, acquisitions involving foreign investors and parties in the various restricted categories of assets and industries may nonetheless sometimes be consummated using contractual arrangements with permitted Chinese parties which could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be majority or wholly owned by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. To the extent such agreements are employed, they may be for control of specific assets such as intellectual property or control of blocks of the equity ownership interests of a company. The agreements would be designed to secure for us economic benefits and to assume risk of losses and control over the subject assets or equity interests similar to the rights of full ownership, while leaving the technical ownership in the hands of Chinese parties.
 
For example, these contracts could result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration: (i) the target company would be majority owned by Chinese residents whom would be likely designated by us and the target company would continue to hold the requisite licenses for the target business and (ii) we would establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target company in exchange for fees, which would transfer to us substantially all of the economic benefits of ownership of the target company.
 
These contractual arrangements would be designed to provide the following:
 

● | Our exercise of effective control over the target company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Our assumption of the economic benefits and risk of losses of the target company that are substantially similar to full ownership;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our receipt of a pledged interest in all of the issued and outstanding interests of the target company, including the right to vote such shares, as security for the performance of the target company’s obligations under the contractual arrangements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our receipt of an irrevocable proxy for the maximum period permitted by law, to vote the shareholders’ shares in the target company in such manner and for or against such proposals as we may determine; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our receipt of an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the target company owned by the Chinese residents whom we designate, or all or part of the assets of the target company, in each case when and to the extent permitted by Chinese regulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we cannot predict the terms of any such contract that we will be able to negotiate, at a minimum, any contractual arrangement would need to provide us with effective control over the target’s operations and management either directly through board control or through affirmative and/or negative covenants and veto rights with respect to matters such as entry into material agreements, management changes and issuance of debt or equity securities, among other potential control provisions. We have not, however, established specific provisions which must be in an agreement in order to meet the definition of business combination.
 
These agreements likely also would provide for increased ownership or full ownership and control by us when and if permitted under Chinese law and regulation. If we choose to effect our initial business combination that employs the use of these types of control arrangements, we may have difficulty in enforcing our rights. Therefore, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with the same economic benefits, accounting consolidation or control over a target business as would direct ownership through a merger or shares exchange. For example, if the target business or any other entity fails to perform its obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies under Chinese law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be sufficient to off-set the cost of enforcement and may adversely affect the benefits we expect to receive from the business combination.
 
While we believe under such contractual arrangement, we will be considered the primary beneficiary and be able to consolidate financial results of the target company in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that in the future generally accepted accounting policies in the United States and the SEC accounting regulations change and we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary by controlling the target company through such contractual arrangement, we would not be able to consolidate line by line the target company’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements.
 
6

 

Moreover, we expect that the contractual arrangements upon which we would be relying would be governed by Chinese law and would be the only basis of providing resolution of disputes which may arise through either arbitration or litigation in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with Chinese law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. Uncertainties in the Chinese legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert the effective level of control over the target business.
 
We have not selected any target business on which to concentrate our search for our initial business combination and we are, therefore, unable to determine at this time what form an acquisition of a target business will take.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.
 
If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
Our business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until February 20, 2020 (or June 20, 2020 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination through issuance of the potential extension warrants, as described in more detail herein) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only 9,275,001 of our public shares (or approximately 37.1% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the 200,000 shares issued to the representative of the underwriters upon the consummation of our initial public offering are voted in favor of the transaction).
 
None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or ordinary shares in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination
 
We have until February 20, 2020 to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by February 20, 2020, we may, by resolution of our board of directors, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination for no more than four (4) months as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on August 15, 2018, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, we must issue to holders of our public shares by way of a dividend one warrant to purchase one half of an ordinary share for an aggregate of up to 25,000,000 potential extension warrants. Each potential extension warrant would be identical to the warrants included in the units sold in our initial public offering. In the event that we extend the period to consummate our initial business combination by issuing the potential extension warrants referenced above, we will issue a press release announcing such intention at least one month prior to our February 20, 2020 deadline. This press release will indicate (i) that the record date to establish the holders of record entitled to receive the dividend of potential extension warrants will be February 20, 2020 and (ii) the payment date of such dividend. Alternatively, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on August 15, 2018, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by obtaining shareholder approval, in which case we will afford public shareholders an opportunity to redeem their public shares. If we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by obtaining shareholder approval, we will not issue the potential extension warrants discussed above. In either case, we are not obligated to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination.

Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.
 
Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
 
Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the legal holder, and effectively redeemed by us under Cayman Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any general meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.

Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by February 20, 2020 (or until June 20, 2020 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination through issuance of the potential extension warrants, as described in more detail herein), it will trigger our automatic winding up, liquidation and dissolution pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, liquidation and dissolution.
 
The amount in the trust account (less approximately $2,500 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest, net of taxes payable). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.
 
Each of our initial shareholders, our sponsor and Symphony has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private warrants and to vote their insider shares in favor of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless. They have also waived any right to receive the potential extension warrants on account of their insider shares.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account. The amount in the trust account as of December 31, 2018 is approximately $10.08 per public share.

The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.
 
TKK Capital Holding has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our initial public offering not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy those obligations if it is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.00 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants and rights and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of our initial public offering upon consummation of our initial business combination pursuant to the business combination marketing agreement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | our obligation to either repay or issue warrants upon conversion of up to $1,000,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. Furthermore, the fact that we will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, ordinary shares, warrants and rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, the financial information included in the proxy solicitation materials will need to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. The financial statements may also be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Form 8-K announcing the closing of an initial business combination, which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial information. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1.0 billion or revenues exceed $1.07 billion, or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
