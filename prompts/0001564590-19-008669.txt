Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Box provides a leading cloud content management platform that enables organizations of all sizes to securely manage their content while allowing easy, secure access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device. With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity and protects an organization’s most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across an enterprise, across multiple file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.
 At our founding in 2005, we recognized that content is more accessible, secure and powerful when it is centrally stored, managed and shared. We have architected our cloud content management platform from the ground up to meet the evolving demands of today’s distributed and mobile workforce, and of enterprises that are looking to benefit from the increasing digitization of business. This architecture enables users to work and collaborate on content from anywhere in the world and allows organizations to centrally apply and manage policies and controls across all users and content simultaneously.
 Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers. This strategy combines top-down, high-touch sales efforts with end-user-driven bottoms-up adoption. We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem. Our sales representatives engage in direct interaction with IT decision makers including CEOs, CIOs, CISOs, IT directors and line of business department heads. We also field inbound inquiries and online sales opportunities. We further expand our market reach by leveraging a network of our channel partners that is comprised of value-added resellers and systems integrators as well as our own consulting services. We offer individuals a free basic version of Box that allows them to experience first-hand our easy-to-use and secure solution. Use of the Box offering often spreads virally within and across organizations, as users adopt Box and invite new users to collaborate. In addition, an organization will frequently purchase Box for one use case and then later expand its deployment to other use cases with larger groups of employees leading to deeper engagement with our service. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use-cases and possibilities with our cloud content management platform and the significant business outcomes.
 We also provide industry-specific capabilities that address targeted business needs through a combination of technology, services and marketing programs. We are able to serve highly regulated industries with specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards. These industry-specific capabilities are aimed to speed the deployment and time-to-value for customers in industries such as financial services, government, healthcare and life sciences, media and entertainment, retail, education, and nonprofit.
 We are building a rich technology partner ecosystem around Box. We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Facebook, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. In addition, in-house enterprise developers and independent software developers can rapidly build and provision new applications that leverage and extend the core functionality of our services, increasingly with a focus on specific industries and vertical market use cases. To date, tens of thousands of third-party developers have leveraged our platform as the secure content layer for their applications.
 We are committed to powering how the world does more good together. Box.org mobilizes our technology, talent, partners and institutional assets to enable nonprofits to innovate and fulfill their missions. Founded in 2014,

Box.org now serves over 8,000 nonprofits with donated or discounted Box access, employee volunteer hours and cash grants from the Box.org Fund.
 The Box Solution
 We offer web, mobile and desktop applications for cloud content management on a platform for developing custom applications, and a series of industry-specific capabilities. Box features and functionality include the following:

• | Cloud Architecture. We have built our platform from the ground up on a cloud-based architecture, which enables us to rapidly develop, update and provision our services to users. Our proprietary cloud architecture is particularly well-suited for today's dynamically changing business requirements because it enables our users to use the most up-to-date versions of our solutions at all times and administrators to immediately apply changes in policies and controls across all their organization’s critical content simultaneously.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobility. Our solution enables users to securely access, manage, share and collaborate on their content anytime and from anywhere, using nearly any device and a variety of operating systems through both native and web browser applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elegant, Intuitive and User-Focused Interface. We are dedicated to keeping our solution easy for users to understand with little to no upfront training. We strive to enable quick and viral user adoption by maintaining a simple and elegant interface with compelling access, sharing and collaboration features.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Built to Handle Content of Nearly Any Type. We have designed our solution to serve as the central content management layer for an organization’s employees. Users can securely access, share and collaborate on all types of information, regardless of format or file type, and from virtually any device or operating system.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple and Rapid Deployment. Our cloud-based software allows organizations to easily, quickly and inexpensively deploy our products. IT administrators can quickly add users, set up permissions, create folders and policies, implement automated workflows and begin using our products almost immediately without the need to procure and provision hardware or install and configure software.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise-Grade Security. We have invested heavily to build robust security features to protect our customers from the most pervasive security threats. At the most basic level, all files stored in Box are encrypted at rest and in transit. Box’s information rights management (IRM) features enable secure access and management of files by providing granular control over users’ ability to access, view, download, edit, print or share content. With our Box KeySafe product, organizations can implement higher levels of data security and protection by keeping control of the encryption keys that protect their content. This advanced encryption feature is valuable to many organizations, including those in highly regulated industries such as financial services, health care, government and legal.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administrative Controls. We give IT administrators powerful tools to define access rights by user, content type, device and business need. Administrators can set specific content policies such as expiration dates to auto-delete files or deactivate links to time-sensitive materials. They can also manage mobile and sync security settings, including specification of which devices have access to Box and whether certain features are enabled.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tracking and Reporting for Visibility. All actions taken by paying business users and their external collaborators in Box are tracked and auditable by our customers’ authorized administrators through Box’s native administrative applications. The tracking and audit data are also accessible to administrators with the appropriate access rights via our application programming interfaces (APIs).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Comprehensive Data Governance Strategy. Box serves as a secure, centralized system of record for retaining content for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations concerning them, using data retention and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities. Our data security policies allow customers to apply quarantine or notification-only policies to sensitive confidential files, such as those containing predefined attributes, such as credit card or social security system numbers, and we provide robust integrations for leading eDiscovery and DLP systems. Our Box Governance product allows customers to control how long documents are to be retained in Box and the disposition of those documents when the retention period expires.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automation and Workflow Management. We give IT administrators the power to automate workflows based on a set of rules determined by the end users. For example, documents can be routed to specific folders or flagged for user actions based on the content of the document. In addition, we continue to innovate through Box Relay, which enables our end users to easily build, manage and track their own workflows. This allows customers to accelerate the flow of information through their organizations and increase the efficiency of their business processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Box Skills Kit for applying artificial intelligence to content in Box. We give organizations the ability to apply machine learning algorithms from leading providers such as IBM, Microsoft and Google, as well as specialized industry-specific vendors, directly to content within Box. This eliminates the need for customers to create and manage separate document repositories for performing functions such as image and character recognition, video and audio analysis and transcriptions, and document analysis on business content, thus improving content search ability and business process automation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Box Platform for Custom Application Development. We provide a content Platform-as-a-Service (cPaaS) product, known as Box Platform to customers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and third-party developers that allows them to leverage our secure content management and collaboration functionality for their own custom business applications. Box Platform helps organizations accelerate their transformation into digital businesses by building applications faster, without having to invest in building their own content management infrastructure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy Integration with Other Cloud-Based Applications. Our open platform allows for easy integration with other cloud-based and enterprise applications. We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Google, Facebook, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks and others, as well as an open API for organizations to integrate Box with other packaged and home-grown applications, including solution applications our customers build for their customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Industry-Specific Capabilities. In order to facilitate easier and faster time to market, we offer industry-specific capabilities for those industries that have significant content and collaboration challenges. These features target specific business problems within those industries with a combination of Box, integration with industry-specific partner technologies, and implementation expertise from Box Consulting and/or implementation partners. For example, Box for Healthcare provides functionality that transforms how healthcare providers work. This solution allows healthcare providers to streamline referral management, and enables users to view and share DICOM files (like X-rays, CT Scans and Ultrasounds), reduces the need for manual faxing and scanning, and unlocks data trapped in hospital-based enterprise systems. In addition, we recently launched Box GxP Validation, which targets life science companies and provides a new approach for maintaining always-on GxP compliance in the cloud and enables organizations subject to Food and Drug Administration regulations to manage both unregulated and regulated content within Box. We are able to serve highly regulated industries with specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards, such as GxP and FedRAMP, and those required by HIPAA, FINRA, and the HITECH Act.

• | Box Zones for In-Region Data Storage. Box Zones enables businesses around the globe to adopt Box as their modern content management platform, while letting them store their data locally in certain regions. This helps organizations to address region-specific compliance mandates associated with data residency and privacy.

Customers
 Our user base includes over 64.5 million registered users. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2019, approximately 81% of our registered users were non-paying users who independently registered for accounts and approximately 19% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account.
 As of January 31, 2019, we had over 92,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 24 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services. Organizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.
 We have developed several programs designed to provide customers with service options to quickly get them up and running and enhance their usage of our cloud content management platform. These services include 24x7 support provided by our Customer Success Management group and certain resellers; a professional services ecosystem that consists of our Box Consulting team and system integrators that help customers implement cloud content management oriented use cases; a Customer Success Management group to assist customers in production; and an online community with self-service training materials, best practice guides and product documentation.
 One reseller, which is also a customer, represented 11% of our revenue in the year ended January 31, 2019. Our geographic revenue and segment information is set forth in Notes 2 and 14, respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Sales and Marketing
 We offer our solution to our customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on the requirements of our customers, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our services through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.
 We employ a direct sales team to offer a higher touch experience. We also make it easy for users and organizations to subscribe to paid versions of our service on our self-service web portal. Our sales team is composed of inside sales, outbound sales and field sales personnel who are generally organized by account size and geography, and/or major industry focus. We also have a rich ecosystem of channel partners who expand our reach to both large and small enterprises.
 We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and through our strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target senior IT leaders, technology professionals and senior line of business leaders.
 As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to both broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide a broad array of services that fall outside of Box’s areas of focus. These relationships include software and technology partners, as well as consulting and implementation services providers that enable Box to address a broader set of use cases for our customers.

Sales and marketing expenses were $312.2 million, $303.3 million and $253.0 million for the years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Research and Development
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to product development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. In simple conceptual form, we provide a product that allows organizations to securely manage, share and collaborate on files. In practice, we develop and maintain a set of sophisticated software services (e.g., search, share, secure, convert/view, logging) around corporate content. These services, which comprise our platform, are used to develop our own applications (e.g., sync, desktop, web, native mobile) and also support the development of third-party applications.
 Our product development organization is responsible for the specification, design, development and testing of our platform and applications. We focus our efforts on improving the usability, security, reliability, performance and flexibility of the services in our platform. We strive to continually improve our applications so that they help users and teams become more productive in their day-to-day work.
 Research and development expenses were $163.8 million, $136.8 million and $115.9 million for the years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Competition
 The cloud content management market is large, highly competitive and highly fragmented. It is subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We face competition from a broad spectrum of technology providers: traditional cloud content management vendors who deploy on-premise and offer deep records management, business process workflow, and archival capabilities; newer mobile enterprise vendors who are beginning to enter the content collaboration market; vendors whose core competency is simple file sync and share, which can be deployed on-premise, hybrid, or via a SaaS delivery model; and social collaboration vendors who focus on the conversations that occur between teams are adding adjacent content capabilities onto an existing product, or serve a particular business or industry use case. Our primary competitors in the cloud content management market include, but are not limited to, Microsoft and Open Text (Documentum). In the enterprise file sync and share market, our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Microsoft, Google and, to a lesser extent, Dropbox.
 We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from smaller specialized companies. In addition, we expect continued consolidation in our industry which could adversely alter the competitive dynamics of our markets including both pricing and our ability to compete successfully for customers.
 The principal competitive factors in our market include:
  
• | enterprise-grade security and compliance;
--+------------------------------------------


• | ease of user experience;
--+-------------------------


• | scalability of product and infrastructure for large deployments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | speed, availability, and reliability of the service;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | low-cost, quick deployment;
--+----------------------------


• | depth of integration into enterprise applications, including office productivity, desktop and mobile tools;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | current and forward-thinking product development;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | agnostic to device, operating system, and file type;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | intelligent content management including metadata capabilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

• | ability to store content in multiple geographic locations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | automation and workflow management;
--+------------------------------------


• | extensible platform for custom application development;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | customer-centric product development;
--+--------------------------------------


• | rich ecosystem of channel partners and applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | superior customer service and commitment to customer success; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strength of professional services organization.
--+------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, core technical innovation, platform and partner ecosystem, and customer support. In addition, many of our competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, significantly greater resources and established relationships with our partners and customers, which can give them advantageous positioning for their products despite other competitive merits of respective product features and functionality. Some competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2019, our patents were set to expire between 2027 and 2036. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
 We require our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights on a global basis is difficult.
 We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
 
Backlog
 We generally sign annual and multiple-year subscription contracts for our cloud content management services. The frequency of our invoices to each customer is negotiated and varies among our subscription contracts. We continued to focus on annual payment frequencies for multi-year contracts in the twelve months ended January 31, 2019. As a result, for multi-year contracts, we frequently invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. Until amounts are invoiced, they are typically not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, billings or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements other than disclosed as part of remaining performance obligation. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider those future subscription invoices to be non-cancelable backlog, which is disclosed as part of remaining performance obligation. 
 10

Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancelable contract and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. We had $311.4 million and $278.0 million of non-cancelable backlog as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of non-cancelable backlog as of January 31, 2019 was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broaden their deployment of our product offerings, strong attach rates of add-on products, partially offset by the final invoicing associated with the enhanced developer access fee from one of our resellers billed in fiscal year 2019 and the timing of customer driven renewals.
 We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the timing and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying price, volume, and invoicing cycles of subscription contracts, the timing of customer regularly scheduled renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenue and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.
 Employees
 As of January 31, 2019, we had 1,980 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
