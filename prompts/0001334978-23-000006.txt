ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "us") is one of the world’s largest out-of-home advertising companies and the only global out-of-home advertising company with scaled presence in the United States ("U.S.") and Europe. With more than 500,000 print and digital displays in 23 countries as of December 31, 2022, we provide customized advertising solutions via our asset portfolio of roadside billboards, urban street furniture, airport advertising displays and other displays. By leveraging the scale, reach and flexibility of our diverse portfolio of assets, we connect advertisers with millions of consumers every month. We believe we are at the forefront of driving innovation in the out-of-home advertising industry, and our dynamic advertising platform is broadening the pool of advertisers using our medium through the expansion of digital displays and the integration of data analytics and programmatic capabilities that deliver measurable campaigns that are simpler to buy.
Prior to May 1, 2019, we were indirectly owned by iHeartCommunications, Inc. and its parent company, iHeartMedia, Inc. (“iHeartMedia”). On May 1, 2019, we separated from, and ceased to be controlled by, iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries. For a full discussion of our corporate history prior to 2020, please refer to the “Corporate History” section in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CCO.”
Our Industry
We believe out-of-home advertising enjoys a strong and unique position in the media mix. With over 90% of Americans on the road each week, according to data provided by Scarborough Research in 2022, out-of-home offers advertisers a cost-effective advertising medium to reach consumers along their daily journeys in ways that can drive measurable results. Out-of-home’s large, creative canvases and access to distinctive features, including three-dimensional embellishments, lighting effects and more, provide advertisers an impactful way to tell brand stories. Out-of-home can also provide iconic, strategic locations, with some advertisers maintaining long-term positions to protect their access to key locations. Further, out-of-home can be planned and executed as both a hyper-local, targeted medium and as a scaled, mass-reach medium.
The out-of-home industry is in the midst of a technology-driven transformation, in both format and how it is sold. Modern marketers are looking to target and reach the right audiences with flexibility to change messaging quickly, measure and understand its impact, and to do so with speed, simplicity and transparency. With the growth of digital media and use of audience data, advertisers are able to effectively reach their consumers by selecting the out-of-home inventory that is most likely to be seen by their target audiences, while also being able to alter advertising messages based on environmental conditions, including time of day and weather, breaking news, changes to advertising strategies and other factors, making their advertising messaging more relevant and effective to their target audiences.
The out-of-home industry continues to grow as a result of increased urbanization and consumer mobility, while other traditional forms of media, such as print, television and radio, have lost ad spend market share as they face the challenge of online content migration, which has fragmented their audiences and reduced their reach. According to data published by MAGNA Global in December 2022, global out-of-home revenues are expected to grow at a 4.1% compounded annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027, while other traditional mediums are expected to shrink or remain flat. We believe that the proliferation of content and distribution models will continue to lead to the fragmentation of other media audiences, which, along with growing advertising avoidance and ad-blocking technology, may further enhance the attractiveness of out-of-home as an advertising medium. Out-of-home has also proven to be resilient, particularly in the U.S., as was evidenced by the industry’s bounce-back from the adverse effects of COVID-19.
Out-of-home is a defensible ad medium with differentiating factors for a scaled out-of-home business that we believe provide stability to our market position. Our industry is anchored on a foundation of assets that are hard to replicate because they are highly regulated, subject to proprietary relationships with exclusivity provisions, and require deep operational expertise. The out-of-home sector in the U.S., particularly billboards, is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels, and permits to build new inventory have been limited as a result of restrictive laws. This, along with numerous signage ordinances, can make it challenging for new entrants to build roadside out-of-home assets at scale. In U.S. airports and in international markets, barriers to entry arise due to the complexity of operating major advertising concessions in these environments. Airport, transit and street furniture advertising media are often built on exclusive contracts, and developing these out-of-home assets requires robust relationships with elected officials and regulatory authorities in a vast number of municipalities, as well as specialized expertise in operating complex municipal concessions.
Our Competition
The out-of-home advertising industry is fragmented and highly competitive, consisting of several other large companies such as Outfront Media, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company in the U.S. and JCDecaux SA in Europe, as well as numerous smaller, local companies operating in a single market or a few local markets. Out-of-home advertising companies compete primarily based on the ability to reach consumers.
We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including mobile, social media, online, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail and other forms of advertising. According to data published by MAGNA Global in December 2022, out-of-home advertising accounts for 3% of the advertising market in the U.S. and ranges from 3% to 16% of the advertising market in the European countries in which we operate, with out-of-home’s share of the advertising market varying by country based on a number of factors, including population density, regulation, sociocultural aspects and historic media buying trends.
Our Strategy
We believe the economics of out-of-home are highly attractive at scale, with the finite nature of our inventory allowing us to manage our rates when demand increases. We are focused on driving incremental demand for our out-of-home portfolio by differentiating ourselves from our competition. This, along with enhanced operational efficiencies, can provide sustainable long-term revenue growth, as well as greater Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin and operating cash flows. Our strategy to accomplish these goals is based on three pillars — accelerating our digital transformation, prioritizing customer-centricity and driving executional excellence — which are being implemented together with the optimization of our portfolio, as described below.
Accelerating our Digital Transformation
Technological advances continue to transform the out-of-home advertising sector. Modern marketers expect speed, simplicity and transparency, especially from digital media. To respond to these changing marketplace expectations, we are embracing technology to change the way we do business. We aim to transform into a technology-fueled, visual media leader, making out-of-home advertising as easy to plan, buy and measure as an online campaign, but with increased impact and reduced brand risk. We believe that leveraging our technology investments to innovate and modernize the solutions we offer, and to make our solutions more data-driven, easier to buy and faster to launch, will further improve out-of-home’s value proposition, strengthening our ability to attract more advertisers to our platform and gain share from other media. In order to modernize the solutions we offer our customers, we have continued to invest in our digital transformation and aim to bring a digital mindset to every aspect of our business, from displays to operations.
Growing our Digital Footprint
We were an early adopter of digital display technology, a dynamic medium that enhances out-of-home’s core value proposition by making it even more creative, contextually-relevant and flexible. Conversion of our most customer-demanded inventory to digital continues to be a priority for our business. In 2022, we deployed 109 large format digital billboards in the U.S. We also added 272 digital displays in U.S. and Caribbean airports and 2,299 digital displays in Europe.
Digital assets provide highly attractive economics, enabling us to sell more advertising opportunities and therefore optimizing yield on a per structure basis. Digitization of the asset base has been a proven driver of growth, but we believe it can also be a revenue multiplier. For example, while digital assets represented less than 5% of our U.S. billboard inventory at December 31, 2022 and 2021, they drove 36% of our total U.S. billboard revenue in 2022, up from 34% in 2021.
As previously described, the out-of-home advertising industry is expected to continue to grow faster than other traditional advertising mediums over the long-term, with digital out-of-home driving that growth. According to data published by MAGNA Global in December 2022, digital out-of-home revenues are expected to grow at a 10.5% compounded annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027. We seek to capture a significant share of this growth as we continue to deploy additional digital displays across our business and further invest in our teams and infrastructure to accelerate this process.
Enhancing our RADAR Offering
We continue to develop and improve Clear Channel Outdoor RADAR (“RADAR”), our proprietary and industry-first suite of data-driven solutions for planning, measuring and amplifying the impact of out-of-home advertising. First launched in the U.S. in 2016, RADAR utilizes anonymized and/or aggregated mobile location data insights to help brands reach desired audiences, reengage these audiences across other media platforms, and understand how exposure to an out-of-home advertisement influences consumer behavior. The insights RADAR provides enable our clients to deliver highly customized, targeted and measurable out-of-home campaigns, resulting in a more sophisticated approach to delivering messages to the right audiences in the right locations at the right time. We believe this was an especially valuable tool for our customers during the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19 as traffic patterns and consumer behaviors changed over the course of the pandemic.
RADAR consists of several solutions, which are built to be interoperable:
•RADARView® is our audience and campaign planning tool. It analyzes historical mobile location data to rank each of our displays in terms of its efficiency in reaching various audience segments and provides a map-based interface that combines aggregated demographic data, behavioral insights and location targeting to discover and select the inventory that most efficiently delivers a customer’s desired audience.
•RADARConnect® is our campaign amplification solution. It delivers ads across mobile and other devices to re-target audience groups exposed to an out-of-home advertisement, providing clients with a simple, easy-to-activate advertising solution that extends reach of their out-of-home advertising campaigns and drives further impact.
•RADARProof® is our suite of campaign measurement and attribution solutions, which uses analysis of anonymized and/or aggregated data to understand the behavior of groups of people after they have been exposed to specific campaign ads, enabling us to measure the impact of our advertisers’ campaigns on a variety of business objectives, including brand attributes, store visitation, app downloads, online engagement, TV viewership, specific product purchases, travel and tourism, and more.
•RADARSync® is our data integration platform. It allows us to use customer data across the RADAR tools, enabling customized application of these solutions to customers’ specific audience targets and goals. RADARSync also allows us to send RADAR insights to our customers’ data and analytics platforms in a privacy-compliant manner, giving customers visibility into how out-of-home performed in the context of their other measured media.
In 2020, we launched our RADARView solution in Europe. RADARView is now available in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), Sweden, Spain, Belgium and Italy, with further European expansion in the pipeline. This offering, including the supplier selection due diligence processes and data collection methods, has been adapted from our U.S. offering and complies with European Union (“E.U.”) and U.K. data privacy laws, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.
We continue to strengthen our RADAR offering through a range of partnerships that have further elevated our data analytics capabilities and ability to measure the impact of our assets on consumer reach and decision-making, which is helping to demonstrate the particular attributes of our platform and strengthen our relationships with customers. By continuing to improve audience insights and data solutions to make campaigns more relevant, we believe we can drive continued revenue growth.
Building on our Programmatic Presence
We continue to enhance the value proposition of our programmatic solution set, which uses automated technology, data and algorithms to offer a streamlined, flexible buying process and greater audience targeting and ad measurement capabilities through real-time, biddable digital marketplaces. The programmatic offering introduces efficiency to the out-of-home sales process by enabling advertisers to easily buy ads across a range of publishers, giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self-service basis and empowering them with a level of flexibility similar to online platforms. Demand Side Platforms (“DSPs”) help advertisers buy efficiently through preset buying parameters, which the platform uses to transact in real time, with analysis for optimization of reach, impact, pricing and outcomes. Supply Side Platforms allow publishers like us to connect their inventory to multiple DSPs at once, exposing available inventory to multiple potential buyers while also giving the publisher control over pricing.
Programmatic out-of-home is still an emerging channel, but we believe it, along with other automated trading platforms, will drive significant growth in the digital out-of-home sector as it has across other digital media types, enabling us to tap into demand from digital marketers who prefer to transact programmatically and work with customers who otherwise would not be buying out-of-home. In the U.S., we have been at the forefront of the programmatic out-of-home space since we pioneered the use of the private marketplace buy type in 2016, and with our differentiated inventory, dedicated sales team, robust technology infrastructure, innovative data solutions and deep industry relationships, we believe we are well-positioned to drive growth and build our leadership position in this expanding market. In 2021, we announced a branded programmatic proposition in Europe called Clear Channel LaunchPAD, which is currently live in France, the U.K., Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Finland and the Netherlands. With approximately 12,000 screens available as of December 31, 2022 to buy programmatically across these markets, we are one of the leading programmatic media owners in Europe. We also have a programmatic offering in Latin America.
Digitalizing our Operations
We are also investing in digital infrastructure to automate processes involved across the campaign cycle, with the purpose of significantly reducing the time involved in pursuing, winning and executing on contracts. We aim to continuously improve the customer experience across each element of our end-to-end workflow and have made significant progress in our U.S. business, as follows:
•Planning. We unified our approach to inventory management by creating a real-time view into inventory availability, purchasing history and pricing, and we introduced a team that supports our entire sales organization with a fast-response service, giving visibility into real-time demand and utilization.
•Buying. We developed a comprehensive system for electronic order processing that captures all relevant data throughout the buying process, and we are further transforming the customer order experience with the exploration of self-service, direct buying opportunities and other direct customer interaction capabilities.
•Activation. We continue to improve and modernize the systems, software and process infrastructure supporting campaign installations. For example, we automated the generation and delivery of creative production specification sheets, use QR codes to efficiently track and manage printed materials, and introduced technology to optimize installation routes.
•Reporting and invoicing. We updated our proof-of-performance tools through the use of mobile devices and high quality digital cameras, providing our customers with the ability to verify, in real-time, that their campaigns have been executed. Our Proof-of-Performance reports are now published real-time through our Clear Channel Outdoor Clear Access application, which is directly integrated into our orders system, allowing for faster invoicing and payments.
Similarly, we continue to invest in digitalizing processes in our European business to improve customer experience, business insights and efficiency, including implementing new or improved technologies in certain of our European markets to better manage marketing, sales, orders, campaigns and operations, with plans to be scaled across our European business.
Prioritizing Customer-Centricity
We seek to further differentiate our products through sales and service and are focused on understanding the needs and desires of various existing and potential customers to make the right investments. We believe we can unlock growth and value by taking a more nuanced approach to our customer segmentation, and accordingly, adding sales channels to better serve the needs of more customer segments is one of our key strategies to access previously unavailable advertising budgets and drive incremental demand. We believe segmenting our customer base by size is an appropriate way to manage and serve customers, as follows:
•Local and regional clients. We believe these advertisers are highly influenced by trust and long-standing relationships and rely upon our sales team’s focused market knowledge and expertise, which requires high-touch, ongoing customer service.
•Large national advertisers. We are focused on opening doors, building relationships and educating decision-makers to further tap into this market. As we navigate an increasingly complex agency model, in the U.S. we have expanded our traditional Account Executive model with an Agency Partnerships team that is charged with building relationships with the influencers and decision-makers who can impact budget allocations on the front-end. National advertisers are often looking for innovations and first-to-market opportunities, which have led to opportunities for collaboration with our Client Solutions Team, which is charged with selling directly to marketers and driving a customer needs assessment.
•Small businesses. We believe these customers, who represent an emerging opportunity for us, are looking for simple, flexible ways to drive their business. We are in the early stages of building a new approach to better serve their needs and believe this opportunity is led by automation, data and simplification of the buying process.
Driving Executional Excellence
To respond to customers’ increasing desire for faster response times and results, we are focused on increasing the speed, quality and repeatability of our key business processes through measurable outcomes, which we have defined as “executional excellence.” We believe that this focus on executional excellence is what enables us to make progress on our other strategic pillars of digital transformation and customer-centricity. Some of our strategic initiatives underlying this pillar include:
•Investing in growth and development opportunities for our real estate asset portfolio by managing our existing pipeline and delivering digital conversions in accordance with a plan designed to match ad capacity within growth markets;
•Driving revenue growth opportunities through an increased focus on key account development and management, sales pipeline visibility and management, training to enhance the negotiation skills of our sales teams, and enabling sales team collaboration across channels; 
•Driving “Speed to Market” in our print installation operations by offering better-than-market guarantees to our customers focused on timely execution of campaign delivery (for example, managing the fulfillment process to have all creative in a campaign up within a more narrowly defined window than the typical industry standard);
•Advancing the development of a central digital operations center that provides efficiency in monitoring and managing our large-format digital displays in the U.S. with a focus on digital uptime performance designed to maximize value to our customers; and
•Focusing on talent acquisition and our employee value proposition, which is designed to retain and reward strong performers, as further described in the “Our Human Capital Resources” section below.
Optimizing our Portfolio
Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) has authorized a review of strategic alternatives for our European businesses, including the potential disposal of certain of our lower-margin European assets (and/or other European assets of lower priority to our European business as a whole), while retaining, for now, our higher-margin European assets. In December 2022, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our business in Switzerland to Goldbach Group AG, an affiliate of TX Group AG. Closing is subject to customary closing conditions. 
Our reviews of our European businesses remain ongoing. However, there can be no assurance that these reviews will result in any additional transactions or particular outcomes. We have not set a timetable for completion of these reviews, may suspend the processes at any time and do not intend to make further announcements regarding the processes for our European businesses unless and until our Board approves a specific course of action for which further disclosure is appropriate.
Our Business Segments
Historically, we had two reportable business segments: Americas, which consisted of operations primarily in the U.S., and Europe, which consisted of operations in Europe and Singapore. Our remaining operating segment of Latin America did not meet the quantitative threshold to qualify as a reportable segment and was disclosed as “Other.”
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we revised our segments to reflect changes in the way our business is managed and the way we allocate resources. Effective December 31, 2022, we have four reportable business segments: America, which consists of our U.S. operations excluding airports; Airports, which includes revenue from U.S. and Caribbean airports; Europe-North, which consists of operations in the U.K., the Nordics and several other countries throughout northern and central Europe; and Europe-South, which consists of operations in France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. Our remaining operations in Latin America and Singapore are disclosed as “Other.” America, Airports, Europe-North, Europe-South and Other represented 45%, 10%, 23%, 19% and 3%, respectively, of our 2022 revenue.
America and Airports
Overview
We are one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies in the U.S., with presence in 40 of the 50 largest Designated Market Areas (“DMAs”), including each of the top 20 markets as of December 31, 2022.
Our America segment inventory footprint of more than 57,500 displays as of December 31, 2022 is concentrated primarily in larger markets, with the majority of our revenue generated from large-format billboards that are generally located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections. Our footprint is protected by certain barriers to entry for traditional large-format roadside advertising, as well as our operational expertise and the strong working relationships required with landlords and local governments. Our America segment generated 45%, 45% and 46% of our revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our Airports segment had approximately 12,300 displays across nearly 200 commercial and private airports in the U.S. and the Caribbean as of December 31, 2022, making us the largest airport advertising specialist in the U.S. Our airport advertising contracts generally include exclusivity provisions, with the Company having an exclusive right to sell advertising space within a specific airport. Our Airports segment generated 10%, 7% and 7% of our revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Sources of Revenue
America
Revenue from our America segment was $1,105.6 million, $1,013.3 million and $853.2 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table shows the percentage of total America revenue by product category in each of these years:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Billboards: | | | | | 
Bulletins | 73 | % | | 74 | % | 75 | %
Posters | 12 | % | | 12 | % | 13 | %
Spectaculars/wallscapes | 6 | % | | 5 | % | 4 | %
Street furniture displays | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 3 | %

Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Note: Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of the items in the table above.
Digital displays accounted for 34%, 33% and 29% of our America revenue during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This percentage has increased over time as we have continued to invest in digital displays, which is a key part of our strategy.
Billboards. Our America billboard inventory is available in both printed and digital formats and includes the following sub-categories:
•Bulletins, which are most commonly 14 feet high by 48 feet wide, are the largest and among the most impactful standard-sized out-of-home media formats. They are generally located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our customers may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning their advertisements are rotated within the network to increase the reach of the campaign. The duration of our customer contracts for traditional bulletin displays are typically 12 weeks or longer.
•Posters, which can vary in size but are commonly approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, are often used as a full market coverage medium for reach and frequency, while junior posters, which are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide, are often used for their proximity to retail outlets where they can stimulate sales. Posters are generally located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, and advertising space on these displays is generally purchased in four-week periods. Premiere Panels, which use one or more poster panels but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our customers with an alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns, combining the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters.
•Spectaculars are large, elaborate, customized display structures that are designed to gain maximum attention with eye-catching special effects, such as video, multi-dimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices, moving parts and other embellishments. Customer contracts for these displays, which are located in New York City's Times Square and Las Vegas, typically have terms of at least one year. A wallscape is a display that drapes over, or is suspended from, the sides of buildings or other structures. Custom-designed for long-term exposure, wallscapes often become landmarks in a city. The majority of our wallscapes are located in Los Angeles and New York City’s Times Square, and advertising space on these displays is generally purchased for extended periods.
Street Furniture Displays. Our America street furniture displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, newsracks and other public structures and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes. We are generally responsible for the construction and maintenance of these structures, and we often sell advertising on these displays as part of a network package that includes multiple displays. Advertising space on street furniture displays is generally purchased in four-week periods.
Other. In the majority of our markets, our local creative and operations staff can perform the full range of activities required to create and/or install advertising copy, including creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the copy on displays. The remainder of the revenue from our America segment consists largely of fees related to these activities, including vinyl or poster orders, production, embellishments and installation services. Other revenue also includes revenue from transit displays, which are advertising surfaces within the common areas of rail stations and on various types of vehicles, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains and trams, as well as other non-advertising revenue.

Airports
Our Airports segment provides advertising opportunities around and within U.S. and Caribbean airports. Airport advertising displays, which allow advertisers to target travelers with their message at key touchpoints throughout the passenger journey, are available in printed, digital and experiential formats and include a variety of solutions, including custom exhibits and interactive displays. The duration of our customer contracts generally range from four weeks to one year, although some are longer.
Revenue from our Airports segment was $256.4 million, $160.3 million and $123.8 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with digital displays accounting for 57%, 54% and 45% of this revenue during each of these years. Airports revenue was most significantly impacted by lockdowns and mobility restrictions resulting from COVID-19 but returned to 2019 (pre-COVID-19) levels in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by the rebound in travel as well as our continued investments in our Airports segment. As of December 31, 2022, our Airports segment had approximately 12,300 displays, including more than 2,500 digital displays.
Rates
Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors, including location, competition, size of display, board occupancy, illumination, market and gross rating points (the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of market population). The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by independent organizations that provide audience measurement for the out-of-home industry in the U.S. using a range of dynamic data sources, including anonymous location and trip data from hundreds of millions of smartphones, to understand the number of people passing a display during a defined period of time, along with insights into their demographic characteristics. The margins on our billboard contracts tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked.
Operations
We generally outsource the fabrication and manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a number of vetted suppliers located throughout the U.S. with the objective of enhancing competition, meeting demand requirements and minimizing time and cost of logistics, and we use a mix of internal and external resources for product installation. For digital displays, we use a number of vetted domestic suppliers for LED and LCD products. Any digital display product not manufactured domestically is purchased through a number of domestic distributors.
Printed advertising copy, which is oftentimes supplied by the advertiser or a third party, is primarily printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl or polyethylene material. These prints are then transported to the display site and secured to the display surface, either by being wrapped around the face of the site or affixed to a hardware anchoring system on the display site. Digital displays are linked through centralized computer systems to simultaneously and rapidly change advertising copy on a large number of displays as needed. Our operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of our inventory for display defects and taking necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time.
America
The majority of the advertising structures on which our billboards are located require various permits, which are granted for the right to build, maintain and operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with state and local laws and regulations. Permits are typically granted by the state and/or local government and are typically transferable or renewable for a minimal fee or no fee. We typically own the physical structures on which our customers’ advertising copy is displayed. We manage the construction of our structures centrally and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements or executed long-term management agreements. The site lease terms generally range from 1 to 20 years, with options to renew in many cases. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. No one property is material to our overall operations.
We are also generally responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures. Our rights to place these structures in the public domain and to sell advertising on such structures are governed by contracts awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law. These contracts generally have terms ranging from 5 to 15 years and may contain renewal options. As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on these structures, we pay the municipality or transit authority a minimum fee and/or a share of the advertising revenue we earn on the related displays, depending upon the terms of the contract.
Airports
Our rights to place displays around and within airports and to sell advertising space on such displays are generally awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or may be negotiated with private transit operators. These contracts generally have terms ranging from 5 to 10 years and may contain renewal options. As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on these displays, we pay the transit authority or operator a minimum fee or a share of the advertising revenue we earn on the displays, depending upon the terms of the contract.
Europe-North and Europe-South
Overview
We operate in many countries throughout Europe and have consistently ranked as a top out-of-home provider in these countries. Europe out-of-home advertising is an urban medium: our portfolio is focused on densely populated metropolitan areas, and street furniture displays are our largest source of advertising revenue. Located at the heart of cities and close to the point-of-sale, street furniture displays have a location advantage, which advertisers leverage to drive foot traffic to their retail locations and influence purchasing decisions. The majority of our customers are advertisers targeting national or regional audiences whose business generally is placed with us through media or advertising agencies.
Our Europe-North segment includes 12 countries — the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Poland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and had approximately 260,000 displays as of December 31, 2022, including approximately 13,700 digital displays. This segment generated 23%, 23% and 22% of our revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our Europe-South segment consists of operations in France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy and had approximately 170,000 displays as of December 31, 2022, including approximately 5,900 digital displays. This segment generated 19%, 21% and 21% of our revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Product Descriptions
Street Furniture Displays. Our Europe street furniture displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, telephone boxes and other public structures. Our printed street furniture is sold to customers as either network packages of multiple street furniture displays or by individual unit, with contract terms generally ranging from one to two weeks.
Billboards. Our Europe billboards vary in size across our networks, with the majority being similar in size to the posters used in our America segment. Our Europe billboard inventory is primarily comprised of classic and premium billboards and is available in both printed and digital formats. They are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks, although terms of up to one year are also available in certain circumstances.
•Classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our Europe markets and generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater breadth of demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards.
•Premium billboards, which are typically larger in format, generally are located along major expressways and motorways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked, as well as iconic city center locations. Our customers may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards. Because of their greater size, impact and flexibility, we typically receive our highest rates for digital premium billboards.
Retail Displays. Our Europe retail displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, are mainly standalone advertising structures in retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from one to two weeks.
Transit Displays. Our Europe transit displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, consist of advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from one week to one year, although some are longer.
Other. The remaining revenue from our Europe segments consists primarily of advertising revenue from other small displays, production revenue and non-advertising revenue from the following sources:
•Sales of street furniture equipment and cleaning and maintenance services. In several of our European markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities.
•Operation of public bike programs. We also have public bicycle rental programs that provide bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities. In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities.
Rates
Advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points (the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of market population). In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays, and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic.
Operations
We generally outsource the design and manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a wide range of suppliers located in many of our markets, although much of our inventory is manufactured in China and the U.K. For digital displays, specialist suppliers are used to supply the LCD or LED technology, and there may be additional factors, such as electrical supply and network connectivity, involved during design and construction. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. No one property is material to our overall operations.
Media or advertising agencies often provide our customers creative services to design and produce advertising copy, which is delivered to us either in digital format or in the traditional format of physical printed advertisements. Digital advertisements are received by our content management system and then distributed to our digital displays, which are linked through centralized computer systems to simultaneously and rapidly change messages throughout the course of a day. Paper and vinyl printed advertisements are shipped to centralized warehouses operated by us or third parties. The copy is then sorted and delivered to sites where it is installed on our displays by our own employees or subcontractors who also clean and maintain the sites. The decision to use our own employees or subcontractors is made on a market-by-market basis taking into consideration the mix of products in the market and local labor costs.
We generally build our portfolios of advertising locations by entering into medium to long-term contracts with landlords such as municipalities, private individuals and shopping malls. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts.
•Our rights to place street furniture in the public domain and to sell advertising on such street furniture are governed by contracts awarded by municipal and transit authorities, which typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. Municipal contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broad range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks, public wastebaskets and space for the municipality to display maps or other public information. In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. We pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the displays and are typically required to pay minimum guaranteed amounts. 
•We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, typically for terms ranging up to 15 years.
•Our rights to place displays in retail locations and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators, either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. These contracts generally have terms ranging from three to ten years.
•Similar to street furniture, our rights to place transit displays on vehicles or within transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. These contracts generally have terms ranging from two to five years.
Other
We also have operations in Latin America, including in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Peru, and in Singapore. Most of our revenue from these operations is generated from the sale of advertising space on billboard, street furniture and retail displays, and as of December 31, 2022, this portfolio included approximately 7,600 displays, including more than 1,000 digital displays. Our Latin America and Singapore businesses generated 3%, 3% and 3% of our revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
On April 28, 2020, following a strategic review of our investment in China, we sold our 50.91% stake in Clear Media Limited (“Clear Media”), a company based in China whose ordinary shares were, at the time, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Our stake in Clear Media generated 2% of our revenue in 2020.
Seasonality, COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Trends
We typically experience our weakest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is generally offset during the remainder of the year as our business typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, our seasonal results in 2020 and 2021 varied from historical trends as COVID-19 had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As restrictions eased and vaccine programs were rolled out, we saw increases in mobility and corresponding positive trends in revenue, with consolidated revenue returning to growth in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year. However, we did not experience a return to our pre-COVID-19 historical seasonal levels of revenue until the fourth quarter of 2021. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented various savings initiatives to increase our liquidity and preserve and strengthen our financial flexibility, including negotiating rent abatements with landlords and municipalities, receiving governmental support and subsidies, executing restructuring plans to reduce headcount and related costs, and reducing or deferring capital expenditures. As our operating performance improved, we reduced or ceased many of these temporary operating cost savings initiatives and increased our investment in our business through additional capital expenditures and asset acquisitions. By remaining focused on our strategic plan during the period in which we were adversely affected by COVID-19, we strengthened our presence in the advertising community, and as our markets re-opened, we saw consistent improvements in revenue. We believe this rebound, together with new advertisers discovering our medium, will continue to drive growth in many of our markets in 2023 ahead of pre-COVID-19 revenue levels, demonstrating the resilience of our business.
Advertising revenue for our business is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product (“GDP”) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, our international results are impacted by the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate and by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In early 2022, worldwide inflation began to increase. In response to heightened levels of inflation, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, increased interest rates, resulting in an increase in our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, during 2022, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro and British pound sterling, among other European currencies, resulting in an adverse impact on reported results in our Europe segments. The U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen against these foreign currencies if the U.S. Federal Reserve further raises the federal funds rate, which may result in downstream impacts to global exchange rates and further adverse impacts to our reported results in our Europe segments. Inflation has affected our performance as a result of higher costs for employees, electricity, materials and equipment; however, we believe we have partially offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates for most of our products, and to date, we have not suffered material impacts from the heightened levels of global inflation. The market risks that our business is subject to are further described in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We’re continuing to monitor developments impacting the global economy. Out-of-home growth has been fairly resilient over time, and as of early 2023, we have not seen signs of a slowdown in our business. However, as we demonstrated during COVID-19, we believe we have the levers to manage our costs should that need arise, and we remain committed to ensuring we have ample liquidity on our balance sheet.
Regulation of our Business
Regulations have a significant impact on the out-of-home advertising industry and our business. We are subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including:
•land use laws and zoning restrictions;
•environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to an owner or operator of real estate properties and facilities, and which relate to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances;
•laws and regulations related to consumer protection, information security, data protection, privacy and unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, personally identifiable information (“PII”);
•laws and regulations that seek to impose taxes on revenue from out-of-home advertising and on personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations; and
•laws and regulations related to labor and employment, human rights, anti-bribery and competition matters.
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, compliance with regulations applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and at this time, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during 2023. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is provided below and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Regulation
In the U.S., the Highway Beautification Act (“HBA”) regulates out-of-home advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the U.S. The HBA regulates, among other matters, the size and placement of billboards and requires the development of state standards and compliance programs for the effective control of billboards. We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements. All states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing, placement and permitting of out-of-home advertising structures. Local governments generally include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes. Each of the international countries in which we operate has its own regulatory regime or, in some cases, more than one regulatory regime. These regulations generally limit the size, placement, nature, density and content of out-of-home displays. In addition, many of these regulations set specific guidelines for the development of new out-of-home locations and address the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, location and permitting of billboards, as well as the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays. Some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions restrict or prohibit digital billboards.
Privacy and Data Protection
We obtain certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including our websites, web pages, interactive features, social media pages and mobile applications. We also obtain anonymous and/or aggregated audience behavior insights about consumers from vetted third-party data providers. We use and share this information for a variety of business purposes and may coordinate out-of-home client campaigns with online advertising campaigns run by our business partners, including interstitial ads and push notifications. In addition, we collect PII from our employees, advertising clients, users of our public bike services, individuals who provide such information through our websites, our business partners and consumers who interact with our digital panels, including through QR codes and beacon technology. Collecting and processing PII subjects us to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection, privacy and risks of unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, PII. U.S. and international information security and data protection laws require companies to implement specific information security controls and legal protections for certain types of PII. Likewise, every state in the U.S. and most other countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their PII. Several states have enacted legislation protecting privacy rights. Internationally, there are a number of regimes across the jurisdictions where we operate that govern privacy and the collection and use of personal data. We have implemented a legal and information security-led approach to address our compliance obligations in line with our legal obligations and risk profile. We are also in the process of adapting our data transfer mechanisms in accordance with significant E.U. privacy case law.
Our Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 4,700 employees, including approximately 1,600 employees in the U.S. and more than 2,600 employees in Europe, with the remainder in Latin America and Asia. We believe that attracting, motivating and retaining great people who allow us to continue delivering innovative advertising insights and solutions to our customers while enhancing our communities is a critical component of our continued success and position as an industry leader.
We continually focus on talent acquisition, employee development and employee retention. We have an annual talent identification process and development programs in place to ensure we have sufficient succession planning strategies for critical roles, and we have a robust annual goal-setting and performance management process to ensure all employees have a connection and purpose aligned to our overall company goals. We strive to create strong teams and an inclusive and vibrant culture at every level of our organization through our core values of integrity, innovation, excellence, safety and fairness, as well as our focus on the employee value proposition, which focuses on compensation, benefits, work environment, career development and culture. 
We believe people can achieve their full potential when they enjoy their work, so it is our priority to provide a workplace where growth, success and fun go hand in hand. We formally survey our employees on a periodic and ongoing basis to measure engagement and identify areas for improvement. In 2021, we launched employee engagement/fairness surveys in the U.S. and Europe and received response rates of over 85%, with our overall engagement scores up from previous years. In 2022, we conducted another employee engagement survey in the U.S. Our response rate was 83% and overall engagement was up four points from last year, a significant and positive result. Leaders have communicated results, and action planning to sustain and improve engagement is underway.
Compensation and Benefits Programs
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, help us achieve our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with market-competitive compensation packages that include base salary and annual incentive bonuses tied to Company and division financial, operational and strategic objectives and individual performance targets, in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Recognition is provided through quarterly newsletters and an annual formal recognition program. Our sales employees are incentivized through sales commission programs, with our highest performing individuals further awarded through formal recognition programs. Our executives and certain other employees receive long-term equity awards that vest based on our relative total shareholder return or over a defined period. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests.
We also provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of affordable and convenient healthcare and insurance benefits, programs to help ensure financial security, enhanced wellness initiatives, retirement savings plans and various other benefits, including paid parental leave, time off to volunteer in our communities, and voluntary benefits such as long-term care insurance, discounted auto and home insurance, and several others.
Advancing Diversity and Inclusion
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We respect and embrace diversity of background, thought and experience and believe that a diverse workforce produces more innovative insights and solutions, resulting in better products and services for our customers. As we bring brands face-to-face with people, we believe our teams need to be as diverse in their composition and outlook as the audiences we reach every day, and we work together to create an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their true selves to work. Based on the latest data collected, as of August 2022, approximately 41% of our total employee population in the U.S. was female and approximately 36% identified as people of color. As of the same date, approximately 36% of our total employee population in Europe and Latin America was female.
We have an ongoing priority to enhance the diversity of our workforce and have implemented diversity and inclusion strategies to amplify our outreach to diverse talent pools across our global business. To further promote a diverse and inclusive environment, we have dedicated Diversity and Inclusion committees in all of our divisions that run engagement programs aimed at improving the experience of diverse groups across our Company. We have also deployed a training curriculum for employees designed to raise diversity and inclusion awareness and surveyed employees globally to identify and prioritize company-wide initiatives.
In the last few years, we led several key diversity and inclusion initiatives, including deepening our involvement with our communities by using our digital out-of-home displays to amplify diversity celebrations and building a sense of inclusion across the workplace through Employee Resource Groups with the mission of providing a safe, welcoming and supportive environment to empower employees to fearlessly address their unique needs and perspectives.
Commitment to Safety and Wellness
Safety is one of our core values, and we are committed to providing our employees with a safe workplace and prioritizing the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees. One of the ways in which we do this is by offering several programs across our regions, including our Mental Health Allies program, an internal network of trained employees who can provide support about mental health in the workplace, and an Employee Assistance Program, which gives employees access to licensed professional counselors and other specialists at no cost for help with balancing work and life issues.
We also seek to comply with safety regulations in our local markets. Our health and safety management systems are subject to regular inspections and independent audits performed by trained health and safety auditors. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor the regulations and local health authority guidance related to COVID-19 and update our robust safety policies and protocols as needed to protect our employees based on evolving local conditions.
Career Development Initiatives
This year, we formalized our U.S. Mentorship Program. Mentor and mentee matches are based on professional and personal interests, and both parties receive coaching and training through a carefully crafted process. Surveys are administered throughout the relationship to recognize achievements and provide guidance to participants. 
In Europe, we have our “Bright Sparks” program, which is a talent program designed for our promising future leaders and experts. It enables participants to develop their skills and career through experience-driven workshops, mentoring and coaching sessions, allowing them to reflect on their purpose and career path while also learning about the business.
Community Involvement
One of our guiding principles is making a difference in the communities we serve, and our corporate social responsibility initiatives are an important part of our culture. As a company, we endeavor to use our resources and products to make meaningful contributions to our communities and have collaborated with local and national organizations globally in initiatives to improve health and public safety; to create a sustainable environment; and to promote arts, education and cultural diversity. We also believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace, and we provide employees the opportunity to give back to their communities. For example, our U.S. employees provided their communities with over 3,400 hours of service in 2022 through our Local Spirit Day of Service program, which offers employees a day of paid volunteer time each year to engage with our local communities. We also have similar community-assistance programs for employees in our European markets.
Business Conduct and Ethics
We are deeply committed to promoting a culture of ethical conduct and compliance. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”), which applies to all employees, officers and members of the Board, reinforces our core values and helps drive our workplace culture of compliance with ethical standards, integrity and accountability. Training on the Code is mandatory upon employment and is provided on an annual basis. Highlights from our Code and its underlying policies, standards and guidance include an independent hotline and no-retaliation policy for anyone who, acting in good faith, notifies us of a possible violation of the Code, our policies or the law; a commitment to human rights and labor protections in all of our operations, and the expectation that our business partners uphold the same standards; cybersecurity and privacy controls; sanctions and money laundering controls; and anti-corruption policies that prohibit offering, attempting to offer, authorizing or promising any bribe or kickback for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an unfair advantage.
Climate Change and Sustainability
We are spearheading projects and initiatives that aim to drive sustainability and reduce our environmental impact. We have announced a commitment to be Carbon Net Zero before 2050 across our divisions, in alignment with the 2016 Paris Agreement. In 2022, we published our global Environmental Policy and established an environmental program framework based on the ISO 14001 standard, which focuses on continual improvement and the evaluation of environmental risks and impacts of our products and processes. In addition, as we continue our digital transformation, we have continued to focus on the efficiency of our technologies (including, but not limited to, converting a large portion of our illuminated displays to LED lighting, using light sensors and dimming technology that control brightness and exploring alternative energy sources) and on developing innovative products and services with a reduced environmental footprint. Our sustainability efforts are underpinned by our various industry commitments, including to Ad Net Zero, the UN Global Compact and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
