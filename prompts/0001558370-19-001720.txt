 ITEM 1.              BUSINESS
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, that offer a clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients with significant unmet need. We have leveraged 20 years of industry learning in the ADC field to develop proprietary technologies that enable us to design ADCs to have improved efficacy, safety and tolerability relative to existing ADC therapies. Our most advanced platform, Dolaflexin, has been used to generate a pipeline of proprietary ADC product candidates to address patient populations that are not currently amenable to treatment with traditional ADC‑based therapies. Our lead product candidate, XMT‑1536,  is an ADC targeting NaPi2b,

an antigen broadly expressed in ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. The first patient was dosed on XMT‑1536 in late 2017 and the study is currently in Phase 1 dose escalation in ovarian cancer, NSCLC, and other orphan indications where a majority of patients express NaPi2b, including endometrial, papillary renal, papillary thyroid, and salivary duct. We plan to select a dose for use in the Phase 1 expansion studies and report data from the dose escalation study in the second quarter of 2019. Following dose escalation and establishment of a go forward dose we plan to expand into patient cohorts aimed at establishing proof of concept in platinum resistant ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma.  
 Beyond XMT-1536 and our Dolaflexin platform, we continue to work to identify earlier stage product candidates employing the platforms described below, and to advance our ADC platform technologies. We are leveraging our expertise to advance platform innovations that further expand the potential of our ADCs to deliver clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients.

     ADC Background
     ADCs are an established therapeutic approach in oncology used to selectively deliver a highly potent chemotherapeutic payload directly to tumors thereby minimizing toxicity to surrounding healthy tissue. An ADC consists of an antibody attached to a “payload” via a molecule known as a linker. The antibody provides targeting capability against a distinct antigen expressed preferentially on a tumor cell, which results in the ADC binding only to those cells that express the target antigen. Upon binding to the tumor cell antigen, the ADC is internalized by the tumor cell and the payload is released, killing the cell in a targeted manner. 
     Despite the promise of ADCs, companies in the field have faced certain challenges in developing product candidates that achieve the optimal therapeutic index, or the balance between efficacy and tolerability. These challenges are characterized as follows:

· | Linker stability: Linkers must be stable in the bloodstream to ensure that free payload is not released into circulation prior to delivery into the tumor. Free payload in circulation causes toxicity. Efforts to design better linkers to increase stability have, in turn, reduced the efficiency of payload release once the ADC is internalized in the tumor cell, resulting in decreased efficacy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Drug‑to‑antibody ratio: Increases in the number of payload molecules delivered per antibody internalization event increases potency. However, the DAR, has typically been limited to three to four payload molecules per antibody due to aggregation, poor pharmacokinetics and loss of drug‑like properties of the ADC at levels above this threshold. Other attempts to increase efficacy have involved the introduction of ultra‑potent payloads, however these efforts appear to face safety and tolerability challenges, necessitating even further reduced DAR to maintain acceptable pharmacokinetics and drug‑like properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Target antigen expression level: Tumor cells typically require a threshold number of payload molecules to be internalized in order to kill the cell. Antigens with lower levels of expression have proven less desirable as targets for ADCs, as a result of fewer binding, internalization and payload delivery events to drive cell‑killing activity. In turn, this has limited the number of cancers amenable to treatment with ADC‑based approaches, as the use of ADCs requires antigen targets to be highly expressed on tumor cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bystander effect: A released payload that is able to diffuse into and kill neighboring tumor cells, irrespective of antigen expression, is known as having a “bystander effect.” While the bystander effect has been shown to improve efficacy by killing adjacent tumor cells, it is also associated with indiscriminate healthy cell killing, which leads to dose limiting toxicities, such as neutropenia. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our proprietary and highly differentiated Dolaflexin platform is designed to overcome these challenges and potentially achieve improved efficacy, safety and tolerability, hence improving the therapeutic index, compared to traditional ADC technologies. Unlike traditional ADCs, where the payload is attached directly to the antibody via a linker, our ADCs feature antibodies attached to multiple units of Dolaflexin, which each consist of our Fleximer polymer scaffold conjugated to several proprietary auristatin payload molecules. As a result, we believe our ADCs have the potential to offer the following benefits relative to traditional ADCs:

· | Improved linker stability: Fleximer is a biodegradable, highly biocompatible and highly water soluble polymer scaffold. Fleximer creates a highly hydrophilic microenvironment, which protects the linker and the payload and results in a highly stable ADC in circulation. We have demonstrated in non‑human primates that an ADC utilizing Dolaflexin is highly stable, with less than 0.05% of free payload detected in circulation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Higher drug‑to‑antibody ratio: The hydrophilic microenvironment of Fleximer shields the highly hydrophobic payload molecules and allows the ADC to achieve a DAR of 10 to 15 while maintaining acceptable pharmacokinetics and drug‑like properties in animal models. In multiple preclinical models, our lead product candidate, XMT‑1536, which is based on the Dolaflexin platform, has demonstrated that higher DAR results in 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  4

 

a significant increase in efficacy relative to traditional ADCs administered at comparable or even higher dose levels.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanded range of addressable target antigen expression levels: As a result of higher DAR, our ADCs can deliver more payload to the tumor cell per antibody binding and internalization event. As a result, in preclinical models we have shown efficacy against tumors with lower levels of antigen expression. Our lead product candidate, XMT‑1536, has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of low antigen‑expressing tumors where alternative ADC platforms have shown either weak or no efficacy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Controlled bystander effect: We have designed our proprietary auristatin payload, used in the Dolaflexin platform, with a feature, referred to as DolaLock, that allows us to capture the benefits of the bystander effect while minimizing potential toxicities to healthy tissue. Specifically, the initial payload released from the ADC in the tumor is capable of a bystander effect. However, as the payload is metabolized over time, it loses the ability to diffuse into neighboring cells and becomes trapped in the cell, preventing further diffusion into healthy tissues. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The benefits of the Dolaflexin platform have resulted in tolerable doses in our preclinical models well in excess of the efficacious doses. Based on these findings, we have advanced XMT-1536 into Phase 1 development. We believe these advantageous characteristics of our Dolaflexin platform provide a substantial opportunity to develop clinically meaningful ADC therapies with potential to address a broader range of cancers than traditional ADC based approaches.
 We have assembled a management team with extensive, relevant experience, including specific ADC experience, from prior work at leading pharmaceutical companies such as Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda, Biogen, Inc., MedImmune, Inc., Bayer AG, Genzyme and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We are supported by our board of directors and scientific advisory board, who offer complementary experience in drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies, management and business development. We believe that our highly differentiated platform, together with the team we have assembled, positions us well to generate best in class ADCs with the potential to transform the lives of cancer patients.
 Our strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading oncology company by leveraging the potential of our innovative and differentiated ADC technologies. Our strategy to achieve this goal is as follows:

· | Rapidly advance the clinical development of XMT‑1536. Our lead product candidate, XMT‑1536, is an ADC targeting NaPi2b and has demonstrated significant anti‑tumor activity in preclinical models of ovarian cancer and NSCLC. XMT-1536 is currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in ovarian cancer and NSCLC and other orphan indications where a majority of patients express NaPi2b including papillary thyroid, papillary renal, endometrial, salivary duct. We plan to report data from the dose escalation portion of the study in the second quarter of 2019. Following dose escalation and establishment of a recommended go forward dose we plan to expand into cohorts aimed at establishing proof-of-concept in platinum resistant serous ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand our ADC technology platform capabilities and build a pipeline of ADC candidates that address the significant unmet medical needs of cancer patients. We intend to establish a leading position in the field of ADCs by continuing to advance platform innovations that further broaden the potential of our ADCs to deliver clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients. Our areas of focus include the development of alternative scaffolds to drive homogeneity of our ADCs, alternative payloads to address additional indications and drug resistance. We believe these efforts may lead to the development of a robust pipeline of ADC candidates with improved efficacy and tolerability that have the potential to expand the addressable patient population. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evaluate strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our programs and platforms. Our platform technologies, and product discovery and development capabilities, drive the potential for multiple clinically meaningful opportunities for cancer patients. In order to preserve a disciplined drug development and commercialization focus, we may choose to enter into strategic partnerships that facilitate our ability to bring

differentiated product candidates to more patients. Our current partnerships with Merck KGaA and Asana Biosciences exemplify different aspects of this strategy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Attract and retain people that share our commitment to scientific excellence and patient care. In addition to our team’s deep experience with ADC science, drug development and operational management, we believe that our accomplishments are a testament to the talent and commitment of our people. Our team is driven by a shared passion to advance therapies that make a significant difference in the lives of cancer patients. We will continue to cultivate the collaborative and passionate workplace culture that has allowed us to advance this mission.

  Our ADC technology platforms
 ADCs for cancer traditionally consist of an antibody attached to a chemotherapeutic “payload” via a linker. The antibody provides targeting capability against a distinct antigen selectively expressed on a tumor cell, resulting in the ADC binding only to those cells that express the target antigen. Upon binding to the antigen, the ADC is internalized by the tumor cell and the payload is released through either cleavage of the linker or degradation of the antibody. Cell death results once the threshold level of payload has been internalized by the target cell.  The individual components of an ADC dictate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the treatment. Historically, ADC development has involved making compromises between features which may improve efficacy at the expense of safety and tolerability, and vice versa. The challenge of optimizing this balance is exemplified by the dearth of approved ADC products, despite the technology having existed for over 20 years.
 Dolaflexin platform
 Our proprietary and highly differentiated Dolaflexin platform is designed to increase the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ADCs by overcoming key limitations of existing technologies based on direct conjugation. Dolaflexin consists of Fleximer, a biodegradable, highly biocompatible, water soluble polymer, to which are attached multiple copies of our proprietary auristatin drug payload, using a linker specifically optimized for use with our polymer. The high water solubility of the Fleximer polymer compensates for the low solubility of the payload, surrounding the payload and protecting it from aggregation. Multiple copies of this Dolaflexin polymer‑drug conjugate can then be attached to an antibody of choice, which significantly increases the payload capacity of the resulting ADC. As shown in the schematic in Figure 2, this approach differs from most other ADC technologies where the payload is directly conjugated to the antibody via a linker. Using the Dolaflexin platform, we have been able to generate ADCs with DAR between 10 to 15 while maintaining acceptable pharmacokinetics and drug‑like properties in animal models. This represents a three to four fold increase in DAR relative to the traditional ADC approach.
 Figure 2.

 Below is a summary of key advantages that we believe our proprietary Dolaflexin platform offers over other existing ADC technologies. We believe these properties will enable us to develop ADCs with an improved therapeutic index that may broaden the scope of addressable cancer patients for which ADC therapies are amenable.

· | Improved linker stability: There are two important linkers contributing to the stability of a Dolaflexin ADC: a non‑cleavable linker attaching the Fleximer to the antibody and a cleavable linker attaching the payload to the Fleximer. The Fleximer provides for a highly hydrophilic and homogeneous microenvironment that stabilizes the payload‑linker in circulation. However, the cleavable nature of the payload‑linker results in rapid release of the payload upon internalization into the tumor cell. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Higher drug‑to‑antibody ratio: Dolaflexin consists of Fleximer conjugated to up to four molecules of our proprietary auristatin payload. Our ADCs typically consist of three to four Dolaflexin units attached to each antibody, which allows us to achieve significantly higher DAR compared to other ADC approaches. For example, our lead proprietary product candidate, XMT‑1536, can carry between 10 to 15 payload molecules per antibody, which we believe will result in greater efficacy than traditional ADCs with a lower DAR. Importantly, Fleximer is extremely water soluble, which helps maintain the pharmacokinetics and drug‑like qualities of the ADC in animal models even at relatively high DARs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanded range of addressable antigen expression levels: The higher DAR enabled by our Dolaflexin platform results in more chemotherapeutic payload being released into the tumor cell for every binding and internalization event. As a result, we have demonstrated in animal models that Dolaflexin ADCs have efficacy against tumors with lower levels of antigen expression where traditional ADCs have not been effective. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Controlled bystander effect: Our proprietary auristatin chemotherapeutic drug payload, has been specifically designed to maintain efficacy while improving safety and tolerability compared to payloads used in conventional ADCs. Upon internalization of the ADC into the tumor cell, cleavage of the linker occurs to release Auristatin F‑hydroxypropylamide, or AF‑HPA, as the primary chemotherapeutic payload. AF‑HPA is a highly potent, freely cell‑permeable anti‑tubulin agent, which readily kills rapidly dividing tumor cells but is not toxic to non‑dividing cells. Since AF‑HPA is freely cell‑permeable, it can diffuse into adjacent tumor cells and kill them in an antigen‑independent manner through the bystander effect. However, release of AF‑HPA into the systemic circulation can also lead to toxicity if taken up by normal healthy cells. To counteract this, our proprietary auristatin payload has been engineered with the DolaLock feature that causes AF‑HPA to convert into the non‑cell permeable chemotherapeutic, auristatin F, or AF, when metabolized over time inside the cell. While AF can still kill dividing cells if generated intracellularly, it is approximately 8‑fold less potent than AF‑HPA at killing dividing cells when outside the cell. Consistent with this, AF was significantly better tolerated than AF‑HPA in rat safety studies. Figure 3 shows the accumulation of AF‑HPA and its metabolite, AF, in a mouse tumor model demonstrating the conversion over time of AF‑HPA to AF, the trapping of free AF in the tumor cells and its almost negligible accumulation in healthy tissues. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The more limited exposure of free AF to healthy tissues corresponds to lower drug toxicities, such as neutropenia, seen in safety studies of Dolaflexin ADCs compared to competitor technologies (e.g., Seattle Genetics vc‑MMAE), with seven out of nine ADCs that have reported Phase 1 results showing dose‑limiting neutropenia. As shown in Figure 4, neutrophil counts did not decline in either rats or monkeys at Dolaflexin ADC doses above the maximum doses that can be administered of vc‑MMAE ADCs, which are frequently dose‑limited by neutropenia and sepsis.

 Platform development
 We intend to establish a leading position in the field of ADCs by continuing to advance our platform innovations that further broaden the potential of our ADCs to deliver clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients. Our areas of focus include the development of alternative scaffolds to drive homogeneity of our ADCs and alternative payloads to address additional indications and drug resistance. We believe these efforts may lead to new product candidates with improved efficacy and tolerability as well as expansion of the addressable patient population. These platforms include:
· | Dolasynthen, a novel, fully homogeneous AF-HPA based payload platform is designed to enable the creation of ADCs with the ability to provide precise DARs ranging from 2 to 24. In preclinical studies optimized Dolasynthen ADCs showed significant therapeutic index.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Immunosynthen, designed to be a novel, proprietary, immunostimulatory payload platform with the potential to create ADCs that can address the challenge of providing a local, tissue specific immunostimulatory response with a systemically administered medicine while maintaining a desirable tolerability profile and therapeutic index.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Alkymer, our DNA alkylation platform, has the potential to provide a broad therapeutic index for a DNA alkylating payload mechanism, and broaden addressable tumor indications to include those that are not responsive to anti-tubulin agents such as those employed in our Dolaflexin and Dolasynthen platforms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We are planning to disclose the progress on the development of our platforms at scientific meetings throughout 2019.
     Our product candidates
 We are leveraging our platforms to develop a robust pipeline of clinically meaningful cancer therapies. Our pipeline strategy focuses on targets that have been biologically validated (either as ADCs or through another modality) and where the advantages of our platform may lead to a clinically superior therapeutic benefit. Our lead product candidate, XMT-1536, is in a Phase 1 dose escalation study. We plan to disclose our next ADC for clinical development in the second half of 2019. In addition, our partners have multiple ADC product candidates leveraging our technology in development.
     XMT‑1536: our NaPi2b‑targeted ADC
 Program description
 Our lead product candidate, XMT‑1536, is a Dolaflexin ADC targeting NaPi2b‑expressing tumors. It is currently in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical study. NaPi2b is an antigen highly expressed in 60% to 90% of both non‑squamous NSCLC and epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the expression of NaPi2b in normal tissue is restricted to a limited subset of cell types, rendering it an ideal antigen for ADC development. XMT‑1536 is composed of a proprietary anti‑NaPi2b antibody, selected for its advantageous internalization properties. We are actively recruiting and dosing patients with ovarian cancer, NSCLC and other orphan indications where a majority of patients express NaPi2b, including papillary thyroid, papillary renal, endometrial, salivary duct.  We plan to report data from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study within the second quarter of 2019.  
 We believe this target to be clinically validated via Genentech’s lifastuzumab vedotin, an ADC targeting NaPi2b utilizing the Seattle Genetics vc‑MMAE platform, which provided encouraging results in Phase 1 studies in ovarian cancer. The clinical study had a 41% confirmed objective response rate by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST criteria), which was achieved without evidence of target-mediated toxicities. However, in a randomized Phase 2 study in platinum‑resistant ovarian cancer, lifastuzumab vedotin failed to demonstrate a statistically‑significant benefit to liposomal doxorubicin, the comparator, on the primary endpoint of progression free survival, or PFS, despite a numerically superior response rate and improvement in median progression‑free survival. Responses in NSCLC patients were also limited despite widespread expression of the NaPi2b target in the Phase 1 patients. Genentech has since discontinued development of lifastuzumab vedotin. The validation of the NaPi2b target provided by these studies forms the basis of our rationale to

develop XMT‑1536 as a potentially clinically meaningful ADC for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. Based on our preclinical data, we believe that XMT‑1536 may offer improved efficacy and a wider therapeutic index in these patients.
 Unmet need and epidemiology 
 Ovarian cancer patients who progress during or within six months of completion of platinum‑based therapy are considered to have platinum‑resistant disease. These patients have limited treatment options including single agent taxanes and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Bevacizumab is also used to treat ovarian cancer patients but it is not always well-tolerated and has shown limited overall survival benefit. More recently, PARP inhibitors have been approved to treat ovarian cancer; however, they are predominantly used to treat BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and not all patients have benefitted from this treatment. We plan to initially test XMT‑1536 in patients with platinum‑resistant ovarian cancer. If proof‑of‑concept is established, there are opportunities to address treatment of first-line ovarian cancer and recurrent, platinum‑sensitive disease where platinum‑based chemotherapy regimens remain the standard of care.
 Given the breadth of NaPi2b expression in NSCLC adenocarcinoma, we believe XMT‑1536 also has the potential to treat a broad population of NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients. Initially, we plan to test XMT‑1536 in platinum‑resistant NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients. If proof‑of‑concept is established in this population, we believe that there are opportunities to move earlier in the treatment paradigm or consider combination treatment with PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies, the emerging standard of care in front line NSCLC. Our preclinical data indicating that the AF‑HPA payload used in XMT‑1536 induced immunogenic cell death support the potential for synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

 The following chart shows the initial therapeutic focus for our XMT-1536 product candidate:

 There are currently no FDA‑approved tests to measure NaPi2b expression on tumor cells. Given the prevalence of its expression on epithelial ovarian and NSCLC adenocarcinoma tumors, however, our initial clinical studies of XMT‑1536 are being conducted without prospective identification of patients with NaPi2b‑expressing tumors. Nonetheless, we have developed and technically validated an immunohistochemistry assay to measure NaPi2b expression which we intend to use retrospectively to confirm the broad prevalence of NaPi2b expression in our target patient populations while correlating those expression levels with the efficacy observed in such patients. If results are sufficiently robust, we believe there is an opportunity to develop XMT‑1536 without the need for a companion diagnostic, or with the inclusion of the NaPi2b assay in the label as a complementary diagnostic to guide physician decision making. If a companion diagnostic is required for the label for XMT‑1536, we may seek approval for our validated assay as a companion diagnostic or we may contract with third parties to create and obtain approval for a companion diagnostic.
 Clinical development plan and timeline
 XMT‑1536 is in a Phase 1, open label, multi‑center study. We plan to report data from Phase 1 dose escalation study within the second quarter of 2019.
     There are two parts to the Phase 1 study: (i) a dose escalation in  patients with ovarian cancer, NSCLC and other orphan indications where a majority of patients express NaPi2b (papillary thyroid, papillary renal, endometrial, salivary duct) and (ii) a dose expansion focused on platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma patient cohorts. The primary objective of the dose escalation part of the study is to establish the maximum‑tolerated dose and a recommended go forward dose. The objective of the cohort expansion stage is to further assess tolerability at the recommended go forward dose, to estimate the objective response rate and durability of response and to further define patient selection criteria for pivotal studies.
 The dose escalation part of the study utilizes a modified 3+3 design. A Safety Review Committee will review the data after each dose cohort of three patients completes the DLT evaluation period and will recommend three patients be enrolled at the next dose level if a dose is reasonably well‑tolerated. After the first cycle, patients may continue to receive XMT‑1536 until disease progression, provided the drug is well‑tolerated and patients continue to derive clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator. Dose escalation started with a once every three week schedule which has been fully explored. Currently an evaluation of a once every four week regimen is ongoing. 

 
  11

 

 Following dose escalation and establishment of a go forward dose, we plan to expand into patient cohorts aimed at establishing proof of concept in platinum resistant ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. The expansion part of the study is designed to provide an initial estimate of the response rate for XMT‑1536 in each cohort and the durability of the observed responses. These data will be used to support end‑of‑Phase 1 interactions with regulatory authorities and to inform the design of subsequent studies. We anticipate that observation of a clinically meaningful rate of durable responses in any of the cohorts could be used to support the initiation of pivotal studies to support approval in the indication.
 Preclinical studies
 XMT‑1536 induced complete tumor regressions in the OVCAR3 ovarian cancer model after a single dose of 5 mg/kg or three weekly doses of 3 mg/kg. In comparison, lifastuzumab vedotin administered via three weekly doses of 3 mg/kg failed to achieve tumor regressions (Figure 10). Genentech published regressions in this model at doses of 6 mg/kg and above, but, given the dose‑limiting neutropenia seen in monkeys at doses above 3 mg/kg, these higher doses are unlikely to be translationally relevant.
 Figure 10. Comparison of XMT‑1536 to Lifastuzumab Vedotin in the OVCAR3 Ovarian
 Cancer Xenograft Model

 Established CTG‑0852 patient‑derived NSCLC xenograft tumors were treated with XMT‑1536, lifastuzumab vedotin or non‑binding IgG1‑dolaflexin control ADC at a 3 mg/kg dose once weekly for three weeks and tumor volume was measured for 60 days. XMT‑1536 treatment resulted in nearly complete regression of the treated tumors that was durable for 45 days after cessation of treatment. In contrast, treatment with the non‑binding ADC control or lifastuzumab vedotin led to modest tumor growth control without achieving tumor regression.

 Figure 11. Comparison of XMT‑1536 to Lifastuzumab Vedotin in the CTG‑0852 NSCLC Xenograft Model

     XMT‑1536 was also tested in eight patient‑derived tumor models of NSCLC adenocarcinoma, where it led to complete or near‑complete tumor regressions in five of eight models and significant tumor growth delay in two of the remaining three models (Figure 12). All models were treated with three weekly doses of 3 mg/kg or less. The models were not pre‑selected for NaPi2b expression and represented a range of tumor genotypes frequently observed in NSCLC adenocarcinoma, including RAS/RAF mutant tumors, EGFR mutant tumors, ALK‑translocated tumors and tumors not carrying known oncogenic drivers. As with the data presented above, each column represents an individual tumor model, and the more negative the value, the greater the degree of XMT‑1536 efficacy, with negative 100% representing complete tumor regression. In these experiments, the last dose of XMT‑1536 was administered on Day 14 and tumor volumes were measured until Day 60 to evaluate durability of the regressions. The regressions were maintained until Day 60 in four of the five models achieving complete or near‑complete regression after a 45 day treatment‑free interval, indicating good durability of the tumor regressions (Figure 13).

      XMT-1536 was tested at 3 mg/kg three times weekly in a series of 19 human primary xenograft models derived from serous ovarian or fallopian tube cancers (n=3 animals/group). Models were not preselected for NaPi2B target expression.  Growth effects were evaluated by calculating median best response relative to day 0, at any time-point. An immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to detect NaPi2b was established using a primary anti-NaPi2b antibody, that consisted of a human/rabbit chimera of XMT-1535, the antibody included in XMT-1536. A tumor block from one untreated study animal, representing each tumor model, was evaluated to determine an efficacy/staining pattern relationship, and IHC values were reported as an “H” Score. 
 Median best response (Figure 14) calculation showed 10/19 models with a median best response of -50% to - 100%. Considering models with a 50% or greater median best response after XMT-1536 treatment, all had a NaPi2b IHC  H-score of ≥70 Amongst tumors with H-score ≥70, 10/12 (83%) models achieved 50% or greater reduction in tumor volume after XMT-1536 treatment, vs 0/7 (0%) models with H-score <70. There was an association between NaPi2b IHC H-score and tumor volume change after XMT-1536 treatment (Spearman rank coefficient 0.76).

     Preclinical tolerability data and therapeutic index
 XMT‑1536 is cross‑reactive with cynomolgous monkey and rat NaPi2b, allowing an informative evaluation of whether XMT‑1536 retains good tolerability in these commonly used safety species. In the exploratory repeat dose NHP study as well as the IND-enabling study, there was no evidence of neutropenia at payload doses that were at least four times the maximum tolerated dose of lifastuzumab vedotin and at least two times the dose that caused fatal neutropenia and sepsis in monkeys treated with lifastuzumab vedotin. Further, there was no evidence of significant pulmonary toxicity. We believe these data, combined with the strong efficacy data for XMT‑1536 in models of NSCLC and ovarian cancer, are indicative of a favorable therapeutic index and supported moving into Phase 1 trials in cancer patients.  XMT‑1522: HER2‑targeted ADC
 Program description
 In January 2019, following a strategic evaluation by the Company of the competitive environment for HER2-targeted therapies, we and our former partner, Takeda, discontinued the development of XMT-1522 then being studied in the dose escalation of a Phase 1 clinical trial. The Company now wholly owns the asset and may choose to out license it to a development partner at a future date.

 Strategic partnerships
 Strategic partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies to advance Fleximer ADC product candidates
 We believe that our ADC platform has broad applicability across a number of targets. We have used strategic partnering to accelerate bringing Fleximer ADCs to patients. Since 2012, we have entered into strategic research and development partnerships with Merck KGaA and Asana BioSciences, LLC (by assignment from Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.) to enable development of certain ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer. In establishing each of these partnerships, our primary objectives were to collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies to validate the potential of ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer, gain meaningful near‑term funding and drive significant long‑term value. Under each of our partnerships, we own the rights to any improvements to our ADC platform. The details of our material existing strategic partnerships are as follows:
 Merck KGaA strategic research and development partnership
 In June 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck KGaA for the development and commercialization of ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer for up to six target antigens. We formed a strategic partnership with Merck KGaA because of their expertise in oncology drug development. Under this agreement, we are responsible for generating ADC product candidates against Merck KGaA‑selected target antigens. Merck KGaA received rights to select up to six target antigens, of which it has selected all six. Merck KGaA is responsible for generating antibodies against the target antigens, and we are responsible for generating Fleximer and our proprietary payloads and conjugating this to such antibodies to create the ADC product candidates. With respect to each target antigen selected by Merck KGaA, we granted Merck KGaA an exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our Fleximer ADC‑related patents and know‑how to develop, manufacture and commercialize ADC product candidates directed to such target antigen. Merck KGaA is then responsible for the further development and commercialization of these ADC product candidates. In addition, if Merck KGaA advances candidates, we are responsible for manufacturing these ADC product candidates for GLP toxicology studies and Phase 1 clinical studies at Merck KGaA’s expense and Merck KGaA is responsible for all further manufacture of these ADC product candidates. Merck KGaA is required to pay its own costs in the development, commercialization and manufacture of these ADC product candidates and to reimburse us for our costs incurred in performing our research activities under this agreement. The most advanced product candidates in this partnership are in the lead optimization stage.
 Through December 31, 2018, we have received an upfront payment of $12 million and milestone payments of $3 million under this agreement. If products are successfully developed and commercialized against all six target antigens, we are entitled to receive future development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $778 million. We are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low‑ to mid‑single digit percentages on net sales of products targeting Merck KGaA’s target antigens during the applicable royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized by Merck KGaA under this agreement.

 
  16

 

 Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for a product under the agreement in all countries or, if Merck KGaA does not designate any ADC product candidates produced by us under the agreement as preclinical development candidates, upon the expiration of the last‑to‑expire research program. The royalty term means, on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis, the period commencing upon the first commercial sale of a product and ending upon the later to occur of: (i) the expiration of the last Mersana patent right that covers or claims the exploitation of such product in such country, or (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term for each product on a country‑by‑country basis, Merck KGaA’s exclusive license will convert to a perpetual, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license with respect to such product in such country. Merck KGaA may terminate this agreement in its entirety or with respect to any target antigen for convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Each party may terminate this agreement in its entirety upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party.
 Asana Biosciences collaboration agreement
 In March 2012, we entered to a collaboration agreement with Asana Biosciences (formerly part of Endo Pharmaceuticals) to develop next-generation ADCs. Under this agreement, Asana paid us an upfront fee for the right to utilize our Fleximer technology to develop novel ADC candidates against a single cancer target. We are responsible for conducting research and creating ADCs that are conjugates of our diverse, highly potent cytotoxic payloads, our Fleximer polymer and custom linkers, and Asana’s novel antibodies. In addition to providing novel antibodies, Asana is responsible for product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any Fleximer-ADC products. Through December 31, 2018, we have received an upfront payment of $0.8 million and milestone payments of $3.0 million under this agreement.
 Takeda XMT‑1522 strategic partnership 
 In January 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda (formerly in partnership with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for the development and commercialization of XMT‑1522. On January 2, 2019 we received a notice from Takeda that it was exercising its rights to terminate the Development Collaboration and Commercial License Agreement between the two parties for the global development and commercialization of XMT-1522. Takeda’s delivery of the notice followed discussions between the two parties whereby we mutually agreed to terminate the co-development collaboration for XMT-1522 following a strategic evaluation of the competitive environment for HER2-targeted therapies.  We are working with Takeda to wind down activities under the Development Collaboration and Commercial License Agreement. Through December 31, 2018, we have received an upfront payment of $13.3 million and milestone payments of $33.3 million under this agreement.
 Takeda strategic research and development partnership
 In March 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda (formerly in partnership with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for the development and commercialization of ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer. On January 2, 2019, we received notice from Takeda stating that it was exercising its rights to terminate the Research Collaboration and Commercial License Agreement. Takeda’s delivery of the notice followed discussions between the two parties whereby they mutually agreed to discontinue the Research Collaboration and License Agreement. We are in the process of winding down activities under Research Collaboration and Commercial License Agreement. Through December 31, 2018, we have received an upfront payment of $24.8 million and milestone payments of $0.8 million under this agreement.
 Strategic partnerships to access antibodies to progress our proprietary pipeline
 Our focus is to progress our proprietary pipeline of Fleximer based ADCs. For this reason, we have partnered with biotechnology companies that have the capability to generate high quality antibodies or that have existing antibodies that we can license for inclusion in our ADCs. These strategic partnerships have facilitated the acceleration of our proprietary pipeline.

 Recepta license for the antibody in XMT‑1536
 In July 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Recepta Biopharma S.A., or Recepta, a Brazilian biopharmaceutical company, licensing Recepta’s NaPi2b antibody for use in XMT‑1536 and granting Recepta the exclusive right to commercialize XMT‑1536 in Brazil. Under this agreement, Recepta granted us an exclusive license and sub‑license with respect to certain patents licensed by Recepta from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and technology owned by Recepta to develop and exploit products containing Recepta’s NaPi2b antibody, including XMT‑1536, worldwide for the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of human cancer. We granted Recepta an exclusive license under our rights in such patents and technology and certain of our ADC‑related patents and technology to commercialize any such products developed by us, including XMT‑1536, in Brazil. We are responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of products under this agreement at our own expense in certain major markets, including at least one study site in our Phase 3 clinical studies in Brazil. Recepta may conduct development activities in Brazil at its own expense after providing us the opportunity to first conduct such activities at Recepta’s expense. If a product is successfully developed and commercialized by Recepta in Brazil, we will use diligent efforts to enter into an agreement for the supply of such products to Recepta for sale in Brazil.
 Under this agreement, we paid Recepta an upfront payment of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and are obligated to pay Recepta up to $65.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered royalties in the low‑single digit percentages on net sales of products outside of Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized. We are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low‑ to mid‑single digit percentages on net sales of products in Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized. The royalty term means, on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis, the period ending upon the later of (i) with respect to products commercialized by Mersana, the expiration of the last‑to‑expire Recepta patent that covers the product in such country (including the term of any applicable supplementary protection certificate) or with respect to products commercialized by Recepta, the expiration of the last‑to‑expire Mersana Patent that covers the product in Brazil (including the term of any applicable supplementary protection certificate) or (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term in each country for each applicable product, the exclusive licenses granted to each party under the agreement will become fully‑paid up and royalty‑free. This agreement will remain in effect until otherwise terminated as set forth below. We may terminate this agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a country‑by‑country basis (except with respect to Brazil) or product‑by‑product basis upon 180 days’ prior written notice for a termination in its entirety or upon 45 days’ prior written notice for a termination in part. Each party may terminate this agreement in its entirety upon bankruptcy or similar proceedings of the other party, upon a patent challenge by the other party or upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party. However, if such breach only relates to one country, the agreement may only be terminated with respect to such country.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate and currently have no plans to establish any cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on external Contract Manufacturing Organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of product to support clinical testing. In the future, we expect to use CMOs to manufacture commercial supply of our products. The Dolaflexin manufacturing process involves readily available starting materials and uses unit operations that are well‑precedented in the field of chemical/pharmaceutical production. The current XMT-1536 supply chain utilizes the same vendors the company could use for commercialization.
 Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, clinical and preclinical testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may 

 
  18

 
subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal to approve marketing applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties.
 Review and approval in the United States
 In the United States, our ADC product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. The FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and associated implementing regulations. The failure to comply with the FDCA, the PHS Act and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement‑related letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
 The steps before a biological product may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND application which must take effect before human clinical studies may begin in the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each indication, conducted in accordance with GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the BLA, which might include an Advisory Committee review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of clinical study sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees, if any, for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post‑approval requirements, including a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, where applicable, and post‑approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.

 Preclinical studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate for use in humans. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Additional preclinical testing, such as toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 Clinical studies
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. GCP requirements include, among other things, conducting the study in accordance with a written protocol, obtaining informed consent from study subjects and approval and ongoing review of the study by an IRB at each site where the study will be conducted.
 A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study or places the study on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
 Clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, which may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in some cases, patients with the target disease (e.g., cancer) or condition. In Phase 1, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
 Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, in well‑controlled clinical studies to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Phase 4 clinical studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under accelerated approval regulations or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post‑market requirements or commitments.
 Clinical studies at each phase of development may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee, if applicable, may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Submission of a marketing application to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.

 
  20

 

 BLA pathway
 Our ADC product candidates must be licensed via FDA approval of a BLA under Section 351 of the PHS Act on the basis of a demonstration that the product is safe, pure and potent. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review BLAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving the BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the biological product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility is compliant with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical study sites for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
 During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether to require post‑approval testing, including Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics after they are commercialized. In addition, the FDA will determine whether the biologic will require a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval of the BLA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, be conducted to further assess the product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 First, the FDA may designate a product for “fast track” review if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees.
 Second, the FDA may designate a product as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review 

 
  21

 
process, assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and shortens the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the filing date.
 Accelerated approval pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical studies to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post‑approval requirements
 Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications.
 In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new 

 
  22

 
safety information, imposition of post‑market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning or other enforcement‑related letters or holds on post‑approval clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Such products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Biosimilars and exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, or the Health Care Reform Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA‑licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity requires a showing that the product is “highly similar” to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.
 A reference biologic is entitled to 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product. In addition, the first biological product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with, not just biosimilar to, the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42‑month period.
 The BPCIA is complex and is still being implemented by the FDA.  In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Pediatric studies and exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, all applications for new active ingredients, new indications, new dosage forms, new dosing regimens or new routes of administration are required to contain an assessment of the safety and 

 
  23

 
effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived, deferred or inapplicable.
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, a product may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, which, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six‑month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA‑issued written request for such a study.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product, including a biological product, as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, a disease for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 A product that receives the first FDA approval for a product for the indication for which it has orphan designation is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 Patent term restoration
 A patent claiming a new product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. The USPTO, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 Review and approval outside the United States
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability and adequacy of third‑party reimbursement. Third‑party payors include government health administrative authorities, including authorities at the U.S. federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for, examining the medical necessity of and assessing the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services.

 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third‑party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs and biologics have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health technology assessments, to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company.
 The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 Healthcare law and regulation
 Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third‑party payors are and will be subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our arrangements with third‑party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research programs, healthcare professionals and others who purchase, recommend or prescribe our approved products and our proposed sales, marketing, distribution and education programs. The federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, the following:

· | the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  25

 


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including private insurers. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non‑compliance with these laws, and reputational harm. Additionally, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business.
 Healthcare reform
 Our revenue and operations could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and elsewhere. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. As noted above, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and foreign regulators from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the Health Care Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The law contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for our products such as:

· | increasing rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription products and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription products reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  26

 


· | requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on Medicare Part D brand name prescription products sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription product costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so‑called “donut hole”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Health Care Reform Act in the future. The current Presidential administration and members of the U.S. Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Health Care Reform Act. Most recently, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Health Care Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers which began in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
 Additional regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
 Intellectual property
 We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing patents that cover our ADC platform, proprietary composition of matter, ADC product candidates and methods of using and manufacturing the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.
 Our commercial success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S., international (under Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT) and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we consider to be important to the development and implementation of our business.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non‑provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are 

 
  27

 
met. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any of our patents.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may currently own or license or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third‑party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
 As of January 31, 2019, we owned, in all of our patent portfolios, 15 issued U.S. patents, 14 pending non‑provisional U.S. patent applications (including one allowed U.S. patent application), 15 pending provisional U.S. patent applications, 35 issued foreign patents, six pending PCT patent applications and 105 pending foreign patent applications (including 10 allowed foreign patent applications) in a number of jurisdictions, including, but being not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Eurasia, Gulf Cooperation Council, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Macau, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Taiwan. Our eight issued U.S. patents covering our Fleximer ADC platform are projected to expire in 2032, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our one issued U.S. patent covering our Dolaflexin ADC platform is projected to expire in 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our two issued U.S. patents covering our XMT-1522 ADC are projected to expire in 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our one issued U.S. patent covering our Alkymer ADC is projected to expire in 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our additional two issued U.S. patents are projected to expire in 2033 and 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; and any patent that may issue from our pending U.S. applications is projected to expire between 2032 and 2039, in each case, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. In addition, we have exclusively in‑licensed three issued U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. patent application and one issued European patent for the NaPi2b antibody from Recepta. These in‑licensed issued U.S. and foreign patents are projected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before they are granted. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant registration authorities, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be granted on the same product candidate or technology.
 The intellectual property portfolio of our ADC platform, our ADC product candidates and components thereof are summarized below. Some of these portfolios are in very early stages and prosecution has yet to commence on most of the pending patent applications. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO may be narrowed (sometimes significantly) by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.

 
  28

 

 Fleximer ADC platform
 The intellectual property portfolio for our Fleximer ADC platform is directed to compositions of matter for the Fleximer ADCs, as well as methods of using and making these novel conjugates, compositions of matter for Fleximer drug conjugates prior to conjugation with the antibody or antibody fragment and methods of making the same and compositions of matter for our proprietary auristatin compounds (and by extension our proprietary DolaLock feature) and conjugates thereof (e.g., to Fleximer and/or an antibody or antibody fragment). As of January 31, 2019, we owned eight issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent, 32 issued foreign patents and 16 pending foreign patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Macau, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the Fleximer ADC platform is projected to expire in June 2032, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 Dolaflexin ADC platform
 The intellectual property portfolio for our Dolaflexin ADC platform is directed to compositions of matter for the Dolaflexin ADCs, as well as methods of using and making these novel conjugates, compositions of matter for Dolaflexin drug conjugates prior to conjugation with the antibody or antibody fragment and methods of making the same. As of January 31, 2019, we owned one issued U.S. patent, two pending U.S. applications and one pending PCT application, one issued foreign patent and 13 pending foreign patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and South Africa. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering Dolaflexin ADC platform is projected to expire in October 2034, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the method of making the Dolaflexin ADC is projected to expire in June 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 XMT‑1536 ADC
 The intellectual property portfolio for our NaPi2b ADC product candidate, XMT‑1536, is directed to compositions of matter for our novel ADC based on exclusively in‑licensed NaPi2b antibody and our Dolaflexin platform, as well as methods of using and making these novel conjugates. As of January 31, 2019, we owned six pending U.S. applications (including four pending provisional U.S. patent applications), 18 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending PCT application directed to the composition of matter for XMT‑1536, methods of using and making same, companion diagnostics for XMT-1536 ADC and XMT‑1536 dosing regimens. We also intend to enter the national/regional phase of the pending PCT patent application in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and South Africa. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering XMT‑1536 is projected to expire in March 2037, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering XMT‑1536 companion diagnostics is projected to expire in September 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the XMT‑1536 dosing regimens is projected to expire in May 2039.
 In addition, we have exclusively in‑licensed three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application and one issued European patent for the novel NaPi2b antibody from Recepta, which Recepta licensed from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. These in‑licensed issued U.S. and European patents are projected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. Recepta still owns one pending Brazilian patent application for the NaPi2b antibody, which is not licensed to us. A patent issuing from this Brazilian patent application is projected to expire in 2029.
 Novel DNA Alkylators and Novel Scaffolds
 The intellectual property portfolio for our novel DNA alkylators and novel scaffold platforms is directed to compositions of matter for the novel DNA alkylators, ADCs thereof, novel scaffolds, as well as methods of using and making these novel conjugates, scaffolds and compositions of matter. As of January 31, 2019, we owned one issued U.S. patent, nine pending U.S. patent applications (including six pending provisional U.S. patent applications), eight pending foreign patent applications, and three pending PCT patent applications. We intend to enter the national/regional phase of the PCT patent 

 
  29

 
applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Macau, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the novel DNA alkylators and novel scaffold platforms is projected to expire between 2037 and 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors and non‑competition, non‑solicitation, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. With respect to the building of our proprietary compound library, we consider trade secrets and know‑how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know‑how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to this technology platform, these trade secrets and know‑how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. For more information regarding the risks associated with our trade secrets, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property—Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.”
 Competition
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary ADC platforms and scientific expertise provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. These competitors generally fall within the following categories:
 New cancer treatments: Many global pharmaceutical companies, as well as medium and small biotechnology companies, are pursuing new cancer treatments whether small molecules, biologics or ADCs. Any of these treatments could prove to be superior clinically to our products.
 ADC platforms: Although Dolaflexin, Dolasynthen and the new platform initiatives we have underway are highly differentiated and proprietary, many companies continue to invest in innovation in the ADC field including new payload classes, new conjugation approaches and new targeting moieties. Any of these initiatives could lead to a platform that has superior properties to ours. We are aware of multiple companies with ADC technologies that may be competitive to our ADC platforms, including Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bristol‑Myers Squibb, CytomX Therapeutics, Daiichi Sankyo, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, Pfizer, Seattle Genetics and Sutro. These companies or their partners, including AbbVie, Genentech, Lilly, Novartis, Sanofi and Takeda, may develop ADCs based on these ADC technologies which compete in the same indications as our current and future ADC product candidates. We expect to compete on improved efficacy, safety and tolerability compared to other ADCs and if our products are not demonstrably superior in these respects compared to other approved therapeutics, we may not be able to compete effectively.

 
  30

 

 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non‑competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early‑stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and tolerability of our product candidates. 
 Employees
 As of January 31, 2019, we had 86 full time employees, including 65 with M.D., Ph.D. or other advanced degrees. Of these full time employees, 69 are engaged in research and development and 17 are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Facilities
 We occupy approximately 34,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Cambridge, MA under a lease that expires in early 2021. We have an option to extend the lease term for an additional five years. We believe that this office and laboratory space is sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
 Legal proceedings
 From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
