Item 1. Business
General
Hanmi Financial Corporation (“Hanmi Financial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on March 14, 2000 to be the holding company for Hanmi Bank (the “Bank”) and is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). Hanmi Financial also elected financial holding company status under the BHCA in 2000. Our principal office is located at 3660 Wilshire Boulevard, Penthouse Suite A, Los Angeles, California 90010, and our telephone number is (213) 382-2200.
Hanmi Bank, the primary subsidiary of Hanmi Financial, is a state chartered bank incorporated under the laws of the State of California on August 24, 1981, and licensed pursuant to the California Financial Code (“California Financial Code”) on December 15, 1982. The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) up to applicable limits thereof. Effective July 19, 2016, the Bank converted from a state member bank to a state nonmember bank and, as a result, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) is its primary federal bank regulator. The California Department of Business Oversight (“DBO”) remains the Bank’s primary state bank regulator. The Bank’s headquarters is located at 3660 Wilshire Boulevard, Penthouse Suite A, Los Angeles, California 90010.
The Bank is a community bank conducting general business banking, with its primary market encompassing the Korean-American community as well as other ethnic communities across California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia and Washington. The Bank’s full-service offices are located in markets where many of the businesses are run by immigrants and other minority groups. The Bank’s client base reflects the multi-ethnic composition of these communities. 
On October 27, 2016, the Bank acquired certain leases of Irvine, California-based Banc of California (“Banc”). The acquisition included the purchase of equipment leases diversified across the U.S. with concentrations in California, Georgia and Texas. The Bank retained most of Banc’s former Commercial Specialty Finance employees and the unit operates from a location in Irvine, California, as the Company’s Commercial Equipment Leasing Division. This transaction was considered a purchase of a business in accordance with current accounting guidance and accordingly the Bank applied the acquisition method of accounting to the transaction. Cash consideration paid was $240.8 million and the net estimated fair value of the equipment lease portfolio was $228.2 million as of the acquisition date. In addition to the leases, the Bank recorded other tangible and intangible assets of $12.6 million. The intangible assets included an identifiable intangible asset representing the estimated fair value of third-party originators of $483,000 and goodwill of $11.0 million. 
On August 31, 2014, Hanmi Financial completed its acquisition of Central Bancorp Inc. (the “CBI Acquisition”), a Texas corporation (“CBI”), the parent company of United Central Bank. In the merger with CBI, each share of CBI common stock was exchanged for $17.64 per share or $50 million in the aggregate. In addition, Hanmi Financial paid $28.7 million to redeem CBI preferred stock immediately prior to the consummation of the merger. The merger consideration was funded from consolidated cash of Hanmi Financial. At August 31, 2014, CBI had total assets, liabilities and equity of $1.27 billion, $1.17 billion and $93.3 million, respectively. Total loans and deposits were $297.3 million and $1.10 billion, respectively, at August 31, 2014. The Company recorded a $14.6 million bargain purchase gain related to this transaction. 
Hanmi Financial sold its insurance subsidiaries, Chun-Ha Insurance Services, Inc. (“Chun-Ha”) and All World Insurance Services, Inc. (“All World”), to Chunha Holding Corporation on June 30, 2014. Total assets and net asset of Chun-Ha and All World were $5.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The total sales price was $3.5 million, of which $2.0 million was paid upon signing.
The Bank’s revenues are derived primarily from interest and fees on loans and leases, interest and dividends on securities portfolio, and service charges on deposit accounts.

Market Area
The Bank historically has provided its banking services through its branch network to a wide variety of small- to medium-sized businesses. Throughout the Bank’s service areas, competition is intense for both loans and deposits. While the market for banking services is dominated by a few nationwide banks with many offices operating over wide geographic areas, the Bank’s primary competitors are relatively larger and smaller community banks that focus their marketing efforts on Korean-American and other Asian-American businesses in the Bank’s service areas.
Lending Activities
The Bank originates loans and leases for its own portfolio and for sale in the secondary market. Lending activities include real estate loans (commercial property, construction and residential property), commercial and industrial loans (commercial term, commercial lines of credit and international), equipment lease financing, consumer loans and Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans.
Real Estate Loans
Real estate lending involves risks associated with the potential decline in the value of the underlying real estate collateral and the cash flows from income-producing properties. Declines in real estate values and cash flows can be caused by a number of factors, including adversity in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, changes in tax and other laws and regulations affecting the holding of real estate, environmental conditions, governmental and other use restrictions, development of competitive properties and increasing vacancy rates. When real estate values decline, the Bank’s real estate dependence increases the risk of loss both in the Bank’s loan portfolio and the Bank’s holdings of other real estate owned (“OREO”), which are the result of foreclosures on real property due to default by borrowers who use the property as collateral for loans. OREO properties are categorized as real property that is owned by the Bank but which is not directly related to the Bank’s business.
Commercial Property
The Bank offers commercial real estate loans, which are usually collateralized by first deeds of trust. The Bank generally obtains formal appraisals in accordance with applicable regulations to support the value of the real estate collateral. All appraisal reports on commercial mortgage loans are reviewed by an appraisal review officer. The review generally covers an examination of the appraiser’s assumptions and methods that were used to derive a value for the property, as well as compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (the “USPAP”). The Bank determines creditworthiness of a borrower by evaluating cash flow ability, asset and debt structure, as well as credit history. The purpose of the loan is also an important consideration that dictates loan structure and the credit decision.
The Bank’s commercial real estate loans are principally secured by investor-owned or owner-occupied commercial and industrial buildings. Generally, these types of loans are made with a maturity date of up to seven years, based on longer amortization periods. Typically, the Bank’s commercial real estate loans have a debt-coverage ratio at time of origination of 1.25 or more and a loan-to-value ratio of 70 percent or less. The Bank offers fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, including hybrid-fixed rate loans that are fixed for one to five years and then convert to adjustable rate loans for the remaining term. In addition, the Bank seeks an adjustable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate appearing in The Wall Street Journal (“WSJ Prime Rate”) or the Bank’s prime rate (“Bank Prime Rate”), as adjusted from time to time. Amortization schedules for commercial real estate loans generally do not exceed 25 years.
4

Payments on loans secured by investor-owned and owner-occupied properties are often dependent upon successful operation or management of the properties. Repayment of such loans may be subject to the risk from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including limiting the size of such loans in relation to the market value of the property and strictly scrutinizing the property securing the loan. At the time of loan origination a sensitivity analysis is performed for potential increases to vacancy and interest rates. Additionally, a quarterly risk assessment is also performed for the commercial real estate secured loan portfolio, which involves evaluating recent industry trends. When possible, the Bank also obtains corporate or individual guarantees. Representatives of the Bank conduct site visits of most commercial properties securing the Bank’s real estate loans before the loans are approved.
The Bank generally requires the borrower to provide, at least annually, current cash flow information in order for the Bank to re-assess the debt-coverage ratio. In addition, the Bank requires title insurance to insure the status of its lien on real estate secured loans when a trust deed on the real estate is taken as collateral. The Bank also requires the borrower to maintain fire insurance, extended coverage casualty insurance and, if the property is in a flood zone, flood insurance, in an amount equal to the outstanding loan balance, subject to applicable laws that may limit the amount of hazard insurance a lender can require to replace such improvements. We cannot assure that these procedures will protect against losses on loans secured by real property.
Construction
The Bank finances a small construction portfolio for multifamily, low-income housing and commercial and industrial properties within its market area. The future condition of the local economy could negatively affect the collateral values of such loans. The Bank’s construction loans typically have the following structure:

• | maturities of two years or less;


• | a floating rate of interest based on the Bank Prime Rate or the WSJ Prime Rate;


• | minimum cash equity consistent with high volatility commercial real estate guidelines;


• | a reserve of anticipated interest costs during construction or an advance of fees;


• | a first lien position on the underlying real estate;


• | loan-to-value ratios at time of origination that do not exceed 75 percent; and


• | recourse against the borrower or a guarantor in the event of default.

On a case-by-case basis, the Bank does commit to making permanent loans on the property under loan conditions that require strong project stability and debt service coverage. Construction loans involve additional risks compared to loans secured by existing improved real property. Such risks include:

• | the uncertain value of the project prior to completion;


• | the inherent uncertainty in estimating construction costs, which are often beyond the borrower’s control;


• | construction delays and cost overruns;


• | possible difficulties encountered in connection with municipal, state or other governmental ordinances or regulations during construction; and


• | the difficulty in accurately evaluating the market value of the completed project.

Because of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds where repayment of the loan is dependent, in part, on the success of the final project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest on the loan. If the Bank is forced to foreclose on a construction project prior to or at completion due to a default under the terms of a loan, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, or accrued interest on, the loan as well as the related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Bank may be required to fund additional amounts in order to complete a pending construction project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminable period of time. The Bank has underwriting procedures designed to identify factors that it believes to maintain acceptable levels of risk in construction lending, including, among other procedures, engaging qualified and bonded third parties to provide progress reports and recommendations for construction loan disbursements. No assurance can be given that these procedures will prevent losses arising from the risks associated with construction loans described above.
Residential Property
The Bank purchases and originates fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family properties with amortization schedules of 15 to 30 years and maturity schedules of up to 30 years. The loan fees, interest rates and other 
5

provisions of the Bank’s residential loans are determined by an analysis of the Bank’s cost of funds, cost of origination, cost of servicing, risk factors and portfolio needs.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
The Bank offers commercial loans for intermediate and short-term credit. Commercial loans may be unsecured, partially secured or fully secured. The majority of the commercial loans that the Bank originates are for businesses located primarily in California, Illinois and Texas, and the maturity schedules range from 12 to 60 months. The Bank finances primarily small- and middle-market businesses in a wide spectrum of industries. Commercial and industrial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs, loans for equipment purchases and working capital, and various other business purposes. The Bank requires credit underwriting before considering any extension of credit.
Commercial lending entails significant risks. Commercial lending loans typically involve larger loan balances, are generally dependent on the cash flows of the business and may be subject to adverse conditions in the general economy or in a specific industry. Short-term business loans are customarily intended to finance current operations and typically provide for principal payment at maturity, with interest payable monthly. Term loans typically provide for floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest.
In general, it is the intent of the Bank to take collateral whenever possible, regardless of the loan purpose(s). Collateral may include, but is not limited to, liens on inventory, accounts receivable, fixtures and equipment, leasehold improvements and real estate. Where real estate is the primary collateral, the Bank obtains formal appraisals in accordance with applicable regulations to support the value of the real estate collateral. Typically, the Bank requires all principals of a business to be co-obligors on all loan instruments and all significant stockholders of corporations to execute a specific debt guaranty. All borrowers must demonstrate the ability to service and repay not only their obligations to the Bank, but also any and all outstanding business debt, without liquidating the collateral, based on historical earnings or reliable projections.
Commercial Term
The Bank offers term loans for a variety of needs, including loans for working capital, purchases of equipment, machinery or inventory, business acquisitions, renovation of facilities, and refinancing of existing business-related debts. These loans have repayment terms of up to seven years.
Commercial Lines of Credit
The Bank offers lines of credit for a variety of short-term needs, including lines of credit for working capital, accounts receivable and inventory financing, and other purposes related to business operations. Commercial lines of credit usually have a term of 12 months or less.
International
The Bank offers a variety of international finance and trade services and products, including letters of credit, import financing (trust receipt financing and bankers’ acceptances) and export financing. Although most of our trade finance activities are related to trade with Asian countries, all of our loans are made to companies domiciled in the United States, and a substantial portion of those borrowers are California-based businesses engaged in import and export activities.
Leases Receivable
Equipment finance agreements have terms ranging from 1 to 7 years. Commercial equipment leases are secured by the business assets being financed. The Bank also obtains a commercial guaranty of the business and generally a personal guaranty of the owner(s) of the business. Equipment leases are similar to commercial business loans in that the leases are typically made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial equipment leases may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself, which in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions.
Consumer Loans
Consumer loans are extended for a variety of purposes, including automobile loans, secured and unsecured personal loans, home improvement loans, home equity lines of credit, unsecured lines of credit and credit cards. Management assesses the borrower’s creditworthiness and ability to repay the debt through a review of credit history and ratings, verification of employment and other income, review of debt-to-income ratios and other measures of repayment ability. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary importance, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of 
6

the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. Most of the Bank’s loans to individual consumers are repayable on an installment basis.
SBA Loans
The Bank originates loans that are guaranteed by the SBA, an independent agency of the federal government. SBA loans are offered for business purposes such as owner-occupied commercial real estate, business acquisitions, start-ups, franchise financing, working capital, improvements and renovations, inventory and equipment and debt-refinancing. SBA loans offer lower down payments and longer term financing which helps small business that are starting out, or about to expand. The guarantees on SBA loans currently range from 75 percent to 85 percent of the principal amount of the loan. The Bank typically requires that SBA loans be secured by business assets and by a first or second deed of trust on any available real property. When the SBA loan is secured by a first deed of trust on real property, the Bank generally obtains appraisals in accordance with applicable regulations. SBA loans have terms ranging from 5 to 25 years depending on the use of the proceeds. To qualify for a SBA loan, a borrower must demonstrate the capacity to service and repay the loan, without liquidating the collateral, based on historical earnings or reliable projections.
The Bank normally sells to unrelated third parties a substantial amount of the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans that it originates. When the Bank sells a SBA loan, it has an option to repurchase the loan if the loan defaults. If the Bank repurchases a loan, the Bank will make a demand for the guaranteed portion of purchase to the SBA. Even after the sale of an SBA loan, the Bank retains the right to service the SBA loan and to receive servicing fees. The unsold portions of the SBA loans that remain owned by the Bank are included in loans receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $9.4 million of SBA loans held for sale, $194.1 million of SBA loans in its loan portfolio, and was servicing $448.6 million of SBA loans sold to investors.
Off-Balance Sheet Commitments
As part of the suite of services available to its small- to medium-sized business customers, the Bank from time to time issues formal commitments and lines of credit. These commitments can be either secured or unsecured. They may be revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs or commercial letters of credit or standby letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit facilitate import trade. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
Lending Procedures and Lending Limits
Individual lending authority is granted to the Chief Credit Administration Officer and certain additional designated officers. Loans and leases for which direct and indirect borrower liability exceeds an individual’s lending authority are referred to the Bank’s Management Credit Committee.
Legal lending limits are calculated in conformance with the California Financial Code, which prohibits a bank from lending to any one individual or entity or its related interests on an unsecured basis any amount that exceeds 15 percent of the sum of such bank’s stockholders’ equity plus the allowance for loan and lease losses, capital notes and any debentures, or 25 percent on a secured and unsecured basis. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s authorized legal lending limits for loans to one borrower was $102.6 million for unsecured loans and an additional $68.4 million for secured and unsecured loans combined.
The Bank seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan and lease portfolio by adhering to certain underwriting practices. The review of each loan and lease application includes analysis of the applicant’s business and experience, prior credit history, income level, cash flows, financial condition, tax returns, cash flow projections, and the value of any collateral to secure the loan, based upon reports of independent appraisers and/or audits of accounts receivable or inventory pledged as security. In the case of real estate loans over a specified threshold, the review of collateral value includes an appraisal report prepared by an independent Bank-approved appraiser. All appraisal reports on commercial real property secured loans are reviewed by an appraisal review officer. The review generally covers an examination of the appraiser’s assumptions and methods that were used to derive a value for the property, as well as compliance with the USPAP.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items and Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
The Bank maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses at an appropriate level considered by management to be adequate to cover the inherent risks of loss associated with its loan and lease portfolio under prevailing economic conditions. In addition, the Bank maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet items associated with unfunded commitments and letters of credit, which is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
7

The Bank assesses its allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy on a quarterly basis. The DBO and the FDIC may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses through a provision for loan and lease losses based upon their assessment of the information available to them at the time of their examinations.
Deposits
The Bank offers a traditional array of deposit products, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. These accounts, except for noninterest-bearing checking accounts, earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management’s desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to tailor products and bundle those that meet the customer’s needs. This approach is designed to add value for the customer, increase products per household and produce higher service fee income.
Available Information
We file reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments thereto. These reports and other information on file can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington D.C. 20549.

The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov, which contains the reports, proxy and information statements and other information we file with the SEC.
We also maintain an Internet website at www.hanmi.com. We make available free of charge through our website our Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the SEC. We make our website content available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes. None of the information contained in or hyperlinked from our website is incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 635 full-time equivalent employees. None of the employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The management of the Bank believes that its employee relations are good.
Insurance
We maintain directors and officers, financial institution bond and commercial insurance at levels deemed adequate by management to protect Hanmi Financial from certain litigation and other losses.
Competition
The banking and financial services industry in each state we are located generally, and in the Bank’s market areas specifically, are highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment faced by banks is primarily the result of changes in laws and regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, new competitors in the market, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. We compete for loans and leases, deposits and customers with other commercial banks, savings institutions, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions, financial technology companies and other non-bank financial service providers. Some of these competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, including foreign-ownership, and/or offer a broader range of financial services.
Many of our competitors are larger financial institutions that offer some services, such as more extensive and established branch networks and trust services, which the Bank does not provide.
Other institutions, including brokerage firms, credit card companies and retail establishments, offer banking services and products to consumers that are in direct competition with the Bank, including money market funds with check access and cash advances on credit card accounts. In addition, many non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal or state regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks.
The Bank’s direct competitors are community banks that focus their marketing efforts on Korean-American, Asian-American and immigrant-owned businesses, while offering the same or similar services and products as those offered by the 
8

Bank. These banks compete for loans and deposits primarily through the interest rates and fees they charge and the convenience and quality of service they provide to customers.
Economic, Legislative and Regulatory Developments
Future profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate differentials and credit quality. In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by us on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and leases extended to our customers and securities held in our investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of our earnings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, and the impact that future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us.
Our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FDIC. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession) through its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans and leases, investments and deposits, and affect interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The nature and impact on us of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies cannot be predicted.
From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers, such as federal legislation permitting affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies and securities firms. We cannot predict whether or when any potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the outcome of any investigations initiated by state authorities or litigation raising issues may result in necessary changes in our operations, additional regulation and increased compliance costs.
Regulation and Supervision
(a) General
The Company, which is a bank holding company and a financial holding company, and the Bank, which is a California-chartered state nonmember bank, are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. The applicable statutes and regulations, among other things, restrict activities and investments in which we may engage and our conduct of them, impose capital requirements with which we must comply, impose various reporting and information collecting obligations upon us, and subject us to comprehensive supervision and regulation by regulatory agencies. The federal and state banking statutes and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks and their parent companies by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the maintenance of the safety and soundness of banks and their depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders or creditors of banks or their parent companies. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continuously under review by federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and a change in them could have a material adverse effect on our business, such as materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers.
We cannot predict whether or when other legislation or new regulations may be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that new legislation or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations. Such developments may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject us to increased regulation, disclosure, and reporting requirements.
(b) Legislation and Regulatory Developments
We anticipate new legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years. Legislative and regulatory developments to date, as well as those that come in the future, have had and are likely to continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by federal and state bank regulators, or changes in the interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of our business. The profitability of our business may also be affected by laws and regulations that impact the business and financial sectors in general.
9

Regulations and regulatory oversight have increased significantly since 2008, primarily as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank” or “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act comprehensively reformed the regulation of financial institutions, products, and services, including revising the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and increasing coverage to $250,000; revising the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; removing barriers to interstate branching; requiring disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation; imposing limitations on certain short-term proprietary trading and investments in and relationships with certain private investment funds; amending the Truth in Lending Act with respect to mortgage originations; creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”); and providing for new capital standards. The full impact of Dodd-Frank on our business may not be known for months or years.
In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the regulatory agencies have emphasized corporate governance, stress testing, enterprise risk management and other board responsibilities; anti-money laundering compliance and enhanced high risk customer due diligence; vendor management; cyber security and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations.
On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with other Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) member agencies, which includes the Federal Reserve, to report on the extent which existing U.S. financial laws, regulations, guidance and other authorities are consistent with a set of “core principles” of financial policy. The core financial principles identified in the executive order include: empowering Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth; preventing taxpayer-funded bailouts; fostering economic growth and vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures, such as moral hazard and information asymmetry; enabling American companies to be competitive with foreign firms in domestic and foreign markets; advancing American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings; making regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored; and restoring public accountability within Federal financial regulatory agencies and rationalizing the Federal financial regulatory framework. Although the order does not specifically identify any existing laws, regulations, guidance or other authorities that the administration considers to be inconsistent with the core principles, areas that the mandated agency report may ultimately identify for reform include the Volcker Rule; and the powers, structure and funding arrangements of the FSOC, the Office of Financial Research, the prudential bank regulators, the SEC, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and CFPB. 
(c) Capital Adequacy Requirements
Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking regulators. In July 2013, the bank regulators approved enhanced regulatory capital rules (the “New Capital Rules”), which substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to banks and their parent companies. The New Capital Rules became effective as applied to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a multi-year phase in period. Among other things, the New Capital Rules established a new capital measure “Common Equity Tier 1”; narrowed the definition of regulatory capital; revised the capital levels at which banks and their parent companies would be subject to prompt corrective action; expanded the scope of the deductions or adjustments from capital; excluded from Tier 1 capital non-exempt trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock; imposed additional constraints on the inclusion in Tier 1 capital (and stricter risk-weights for) mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets, and minority interests; and imposed stricter risk-weights for certain assets, including for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures. Under the New Capital Rules, the Company and the Bank made a one-time election to remove certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income from the computation of common equity regulatory capital.
The New Capital Rules require banking organizations to maintain: (i) a minimum capital ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%; (ii) a minimum capital ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%; (iii) a minimum capital ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%; and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets of 4.0%. In addition, as fully-phased in on January 1, 2019, the New Capital Rules require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the minimum capital ratios. Banking organizations with capital ratios above the minimum capital ratio but below the capital conservation buffer will face limitation on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers.
 Capital adequacy requirements and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations (See “Prompt Corrective Action Provisions” below), involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations 
10

require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with an organization’s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans and leases, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Banking organizations engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. To the extent that the new rules are not fully phased in, the prior capital rules continue to apply.
At December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank’s total risk-based capital ratios were 14.54% and 14.19%, respectively; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were 11.74% and 13.47%, respectively; Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios were 11.32% and 13.47%, respectively, and the Company’s and Bank’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratios were 10.18% and 11.67%, respectively, all of which ratios exceeded the minimum percentage requirements for the Bank to be deemed “well-capitalized” and for the Company to meet and exceed all applicable capital ratio requirements for regulatory purposes. The Bank’s capital conservation buffer was 6.19% and 7.20% and the Company’s capital conservation buffer was 5.74% and 6.55% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources.” The federal banking regulators may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and may therefore be subject to restrictions on taking brokered deposits.
Legislation enacted in 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions and holding companies with less than $10 billion of assets. Banks meeting the specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The federal agencies issued a proposed rule in November 2018 that would set the community bank leverage ratio at 9%. 
While the New Capital Rules set higher regulatory capital requirements for the Company and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The implementation of the New Capital Rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company’s net income and return on equity, restrict the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses and require the raising of additional capital.
Management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank would meet all applicable capital requirements under the New Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently in effect. 
(d) Final Volcker Rule
Under the Volcker Rule, and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities, including the Company and the Bank, are restricted in their ability to engage in activities that are considered short-term proprietary trading and their ability to invest in and have relationships with certain private investment funds, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered “covered funds.” The regulation implementing these restrictions became effective on April 1, 2014, although the Federal Reserve extended the compliance period generally until July 2015. In addition, the compliance period for certain investments in and relationships with certain covered funds was extended by the Federal Reserve to July 2017. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2018 and 2017 that were subject to the Volcker Rule. Therefore, while the Volcker Rule, including its implementing regulations, requires us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting, it did not require any material changes in our operations or business. Legislation enacted in 2018 exempts bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets if its total trading assets or liabilities do not exceed 5% of total consolidated assets.
(e) Bank Holding Company Regulation
The Company is a bank holding company and a financial holding company that is subject to comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve.
Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by Federal and State laws and regulatory agencies, which may affect the cost of doing business, and may limit permissible activities and expansion or impact the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. Federal and state banking laws and regulations, among other things:

• | Require periodic reports and such additional reports of information as the Federal Reserve may require;

11


• | Limit the scope of bank holding companies’ activities and investments;


• | Require bank holding companies to meet or exceed certain levels of capital (See “Capital Adequacy Requirements” above);


• | Require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank.


• | Limit dividends payable to shareholders and restricts the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on both its common and preferred stock is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Substantially all of the Company’s funds to pay dividends or to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations are derived from dividends paid by the Bank;


• | Require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary;


• | Require the prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit golden parachute payments, including change in control agreements, or new employment agreements with such payment terms, which are contingent upon termination if an institution is in “troubled condition”;


• | Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities; and


• | Require prior Federal Reserve approval to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank, to acquire more than 5% of a class of voting shares of a bank, or to merge with another bank holding company and consider certain competitive, management, financial, anti-money-laundering compliance, potential impact on U.S. financial stability or other factors in granting these approvals, in addition to similar California or other state banking agency approvals which may also be required.

A bank holding company is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. Examinations are designed to inform the Federal Reserve of the financial condition and nature of the operations of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and to monitor compliance with the BHCA and other laws affecting the operations of bank holding companies. To determine whether potential weaknesses in the condition or operations of bank holding companies might pose a risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks, examinations focus on whether a bank holding company has adequate systems and internal controls in place to manage the risks inherent in its business, including credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal risk and reputation risk. Bank holding companies may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the Federal Reserve for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the Federal Reserve. Enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, the imposition of civil money penalties, the requirement to meet and maintain specific capital levels for any capital measure, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or removal and prohibition orders against officers or directors and other institution-affiliated parties. 
(f) Other Restrictions on the Company’s Activities
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) permits a qualifying bank holding company to elect “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a bank holding company. These broader activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be “financial in nature” or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. In addition, a financial holding company is permitted to conduct new permissible financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve. In order to elect financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding company must be considered well capitalized and well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, depository subsidiaries must receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”). Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time period could result in material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company, may adversely affect the financial holding company's ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, may lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks, may require all activities to be conformed to those otherwise permissible for a bank holding company, or may result in the loss of financial holding company status. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of a financial holding company, such information may not necessarily be available to the public. The Company elected financial holding company status in 2000. Neither the Company nor the Bank engages in any activities that are permissible only for a financial holding company. The Bank was rated “Satisfactory” in meeting community credit needs under the CRA at its most recent examination for CRA performance.
12

The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. The DBO approvals may also be required for certain mergers and acquisitions.
(g) Bank Regulation
The Bank is a California state-chartered commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the FDIC. Effective July 19, 2016, the Bank converted from a state member bank to a state nonmember bank and, as a result, the FDIC is its primary federal bank regulator. The DBO remains the Bank’s primary state bank regulator. The Bank is subject to comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the FDIC and the DBO. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, their activities relating to dividends, investments, loans, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, servicing and foreclosing on loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching and mergers and acquisitions. 
Banks are also subject to restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions with affiliates and other related parties. The Federal Reserve Regulation O imposes limitations on loans or extensions of credit to “insiders”, including officers, directors, and principal shareholders. The Federal Reserve Act Section 23A and Regulation W impose quantitative limits, qualitative requirements, and collateral requirements on certain transactions with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Transactions covered generally include loans, extensions of credit, investments in securities issued by an affiliate, and acquisitions of assets from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W require that most types of transactions by a bank with, or for the benefit of, an affiliate be on terms and conditions at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties. Dodd-Frank expanded definitions and restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under Sections 23A and 23B and also lending limits for derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions.
Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDI Act”) and the California Financial Code, California state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries. Further, the Bank may conduct certain “financial” activities permitted under GLBA in a “financial subsidiary” to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the Bank is and remains “well-capitalized,” “well-managed” and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. The Bank currently has no financial subsidiaries.
(h) Enforcement Authority
The federal and California regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of appropriate loan and lease loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution’s capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems and security, and internal audit systems; (2) loan and lease documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or FDIC, as applicable, determines that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the FDIC have residual authority to:

• | Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice;


• | Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which could preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits;


• | Restrict the Bank’s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions, including bidding in FDIC receiverships for failed banks;


• | Enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions, including required Board resolutions, Matters Requiring Board Attention, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices;


• | Require the sale of subsidiaries or assets;


• | Limit dividend and distributions;

13


• | Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and


• | Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver.

(i) Deposit Insurance
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits for each depositor. As a general matter, the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by FDIC modeling based on regulatory capital and other financial ratios as well as supervisory factors. The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank’s depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank’s charter by the DBO.
We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance, which can be affected by the cost of bank failures to the FDIC among other factors. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock.
(j) Prompt Corrective Action Provisions
The FDI Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy requirements, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the bank’s capital ratios, the agencies’ regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank’s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.
The prompt corrective action standards were changed when the New Capital Rule ratios became effective. In order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action standards, the Bank is required to meet the new Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged).
(k) Dividends
The Company depends in part upon dividends received from the Bank to fund its activities, including the payment of dividends. The Company and the Bank are subject to various federal and state restrictions on their ability to pay dividends. It is the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. In addition, the federal bank regulators are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and, depending upon the circumstances, could find that paying a dividend or making a capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management’s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The New Capital rules may restrict dividends by the Bank if the additional capital conservation buffer is not achieved.
The power of the board of directors of the Bank to declare a cash dividend to the Company is subject to California law, which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank’s retained earnings or net income for its last three 
14

fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the DBO, in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year.
(l) Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws
The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the CRA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and various federal and state privacy protection laws. Noncompliance with any of these laws could subject the Bank to compliance enforcement actions as well as lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition.
These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans and leases, servicing, collecting and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The bank regulators examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA requires the bank regulators to take into account the bank’s record in meeting the needs of its communities when considering an application by a bank to establish or relocate a branch or to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions, or an application by the parent holding company to merge with another bank holding company or acquire a banking organization. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The Bank was rated “Satisfactory” in meeting community credit needs under the CRA at its most recent examination for CRA performance.
Dodd-Frank provided for the creation of the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB's functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to banks, and banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency.
(m) Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member and holder of the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLBSF”). There are a total of eleven Federal Home Loan Banks (each, an “FHLB”) across the U.S. owned by their members who are more than 7,300 community financial institutions of all sizes and types. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and makes available loans or advances to its members. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB. Each member of FHLBSF is currently required to own stock in an amount equal to the greater of (i) a membership stock requirement of 1.0 percent of an institution’s “membership asset value” which is determined by multiplying the amount of the member’s membership assets by the applicable membership asset factors and is capped at $15 million, or (ii) an activity based stock requirement (2.7% of the member’s outstanding advances). At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the FHLBSF’s stock ownership requirement, and our investment in FHLBSF capital stock was $16.4 million. The total borrowing capacity available based on pledged collateral and the remaining available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2018 were $924.4 million and $729.4 million, respectively.
(n) Impact of Monetary Policies
The earnings and growth of the Bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. As a result, the Bank’s performance is influenced by general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of the regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession) by its open-market operations in U.S. government 
15

securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the Federal Reserve Banks. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans and leases, investments, and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans and leases, and deposits. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted.
(o) Regulation of Non-Bank Subsidiaries
Non-bank subsidiaries are subject to additional or separate regulation and supervision by other state, federal and self-regulatory bodies. Additionally, any foreign-based subsidiaries would also be subject to foreign laws and regulations. 
(p) Federal Securities Law
The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company is subject to the information and proxy solicitation requirements, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
