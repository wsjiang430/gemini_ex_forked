Item 1. Business 
 
We are a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company working to develop the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, -approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications. Our goal is to launch ONS-5010 as the first and only approved bevacizumab in the United States, Europe, Japan and other markets for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, diabetic macular edema, or DME, and branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO.
 
ONS-5010 is an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development to be administered as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. Bevacizumab is a full-length, humanized anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) recombinant monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that inhibits VEGF and associated angiogenic activity. The study design for our Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate ONS-5010 as an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab was reviewed at an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in April 2018, and we filed our investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA in the first quarter of calendar 2019.
 
Our Phase 3 program for ONS-5010 in wet AMD involves two clinical trials, which we refer to as NORSE 1 and NORSE 2, evaluating ONS-5010 against ranibizumab (LUCENTIS). Enrollment in the NORSE 1 study is complete with 61 patients enrolled, all in Australia. The NORSE 2 study has been initiated and began enrolling wet AMD patients in July 2019. The NORSE 2 study is expected to enroll a total of at least 220 patients and is being conducted in the United States. The endpoint for both studies is a mean increase in baseline visual acuity at 11 months for ONS-5010 dosed on a monthly basis compared to LUCENTIS dosed using the alternative PIER clinical trial dosing regimen of three-monthly doses followed by quarterly dosing.
 
Currently, the cancer drug Avastin (bevacizumab) is used off-label for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases such as DME and BRVO even though Avastin has not been approved by regulatory authorities for use in these diseases. If the ONS-5010 clinical program is successful, it will support our plans to submit for regulatory approval in multiple markets in 2021 including the United States, Europe and Japan. Because there are no approved bevacizumab products for the treatment of retinal diseases in such major markets, we are developing ONS-5010 as a novel biologic and not using the biosimilar drug development pathway that would be required if Avastin were an approved drug for the targeted diseases. If approved, we believe ONS-5010 has potential to mitigate risks associated with off-label use of bevacizumab. Off-label use of bevacizumab is currently estimated to account for at least 50% of all wet AMD prescriptions in the United States.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to launch ONS-5010 as the first, and only, approved bevacizumab for ophthalmic use in the United States, Europe, Japan and other markets. In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted a streamlined clinical and regulatory strategy to quickly and efficiently complete the process required to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, with the FDA at the earliest opportunity. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Leveraging the ophthalmic drug development and commercialization expertise of our leadership team. Members of our executive team have extensive expertise in developing and commercializing treatments for retinal diseases, such as wet AMD. We intend to leverage their collective experience to further the development of, and execute an optimal commercial strategy for, ONS-5010.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engaging with regulatory agencies to establish clear guidelines for potential approval. We have continued our approach to work closely with regulatory authorities to develop and conduct clinical trials that we believe will appropriately support approval of our product candidates if our clinical trials are successful. As an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab, we believe ONS-5010 has a well-defined regulatory pathway.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducting and efficiently executing clinical trials inside and outside of the United States to support potential approval. We have designed our ONS-5010 clinical program to take advantage of reduced costs for clinical trials conducted outside of the United States, as appropriate. We intend to further this strategy, in a manner that will support a BLA submission in the United States at the earliest opportunity for ONS-5010.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Reducing and managing costs to minimize additional investment to complete our development programs. We have made the strategic decision to outsource the commercial manufacturing and future clinical trial supply manufacturing for our product candidates. We believe this will significantly reduce future overhead costs not directly related to our ONS-5010 program.

Our Product Candidate Portfolio
 
Our product candidate portfolio includes our lead product candidate, ONS-5010, which we are actively developing, as well as our biosimilar product candidates, which we only plan to further advance upon entering into a license or co-development agreement with a partner in the major markets. We refer to these legacy biosimilar product candidates as our inactive development portfolio.
Active Development Portfolio
 
ONS-5010 — Bevacizumab for Ophthalmic Use
 
ONS-5010 is an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development to be administered as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. We currently intend to commercialize both vial and pre-filled syringe formulations if approved.
 
Bevacizumab is a full-length, humanized anti-VEGF recombinant mAb that inhibits VEGF and associated angiogenic (the growth of new blood vessels) activity. With wet AMD, abnormally high levels of VEGF are secreted in the eye. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new abnormal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF injection therapy blocks this growth. Since the advent of anti-VEGF therapy, it has become the standard of care treatment option within the retina community globally.
 
Previously, we were developing ONS-5010 as a biosimilar (ONS-1045) of the cancer drug Avastin for use in oncology indications. In the ONS-1045 program, our bevacizumab met the primary and secondary endpoints in a three-arm single-dose pharmacokinetic, or PK, Phase 1 clinical trial (see “—Inactive Development Portfolio-ONS-1045— Bevacizumab (Avastin) Biosimilar”). All the PK endpoints met the bioequivalency criteria of the geometric mean ratios within 90% confidence interval of 80-125% when compared to both U.S.- and E.U.-sourced Avastin reference products. We are developing ONS-5010 as an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for a BLA filing and not using the biosimilar drug development pathway. The following figure demonstrates the concentration-time profile of ONS-1045, U.S.-licensed Avastin, and E.U.-licensed Avastin as the mean. The vertical line at time zero denotes dosing. These results suggest a high degree of similarity among the three products.

Comparative Potency of ONS-1045 versus Avastin (U.S. and E.U.)
 

Market Opportunity
 
Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a common eye condition and a leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. Wet AMD is a form of “late stage” AMD and is also called neovascular AMD. In wet AMD, abnormal blood vessels grow underneath the retina. These vessels can leak fluid and blood, which may lead to swelling and damage of the macula causing vision loss. With wet AMD, abnormally high levels of VEGF are secreted in the eyes. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new abnormal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF injection therapy blocks this growth. Since the advent of anti-VEGF therapy, it has become the standard of care treatment option within the retina community, globally. Wet AMD is a significant disease worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of over 2.8 million patients diagnosed in the United States, top five European countries and Japan alone in 2018 (GlobalData). Annual revenue from LUCENTIS and EYLEA (two approved anti-VEGF therapies) was approximately $9.0 billion in 2018. Although bevacizumab is not currently FDA-approved for use in treating wet AMD, it is believed that bevacizumab currently accounts for at least 50% of all wet AMD prescriptions in the United States, where Avastin is repackaged through compounding pharmacies and prescribed off-label. If approved, we believe ONS-5010 has potential to mitigate risks associated with off-label repackaging of bevacizumab.
 
DME is caused by a complication of diabetes called diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in working age Americans. Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes and is caused by ongoing damage to the small blood vessels of the retina. The leakage of fluid into the retina may lead to swelling of the surrounding tissue, including the macula. DME is the most common cause of vision loss in people with diabetic retinopathy. DME can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, although it is more likely to occur in later stages of the disease. There were approximately 1.0 million patients with DME in the United States, top five European countries and Japan alone in 2018 (GlobalData).
 
In BRVO, retinal vein occlusions occur when there is a blockage of veins carrying blood with needed oxygen and nutrients away from the nerve cells in the retina. A blockage in the main vein of the retina is referred to as a central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO, while a blockage in a smaller vein is called a branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. Per the American Academy of Ophthalmology, retinal vein occlusions are the second most common retinal vascular disorder after diabetic retinopathy. There were an estimated 0.3 million patients with BRVO in the United States, top five European countries and Japan alone in 2018 (GlobalData).

Clinical Development Status
 
The study design for our Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate ONS-5010 as an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab was reviewed with the FDA at an end of Phase 2 meeting in April 2018. We began enrolling patients in the NORSE 2 study in July 2019. NORSE 2 is the second study in the Phase 3 clinical program for ONS-5010 for the treatment of wet AMD. We are conducting the NORSE 2 study in the United States. The NORSE 1 study, the first clinical study in the Phase 3 clinical trial program for ONS-5010, completed enrollment in Australia in August 2019. If the program is successful, it will support our plans to submit for regulatory approval in multiple markets in 2021, including the United States, Europe and Japan. Because enrollment completed in August 2019, we currently expect to report top line data from NORSE 1 in the third quarter of calendar 2020. For NORSE 2, we expect to report top line data and submit a BLA in the first calendar quarter of 2021.
 
We have also received agreement from the FDA on three Special Protocol Assessments, or SPAs, for three additional registration clinical trials for our ongoing Phase 3 program for ONS-5010. The agreements reached with the FDA on these SPAs cover the protocols for NORSE 4, a registration clinical trial to treat BRVO, and NORSE 5 and NORSE 6, two registration clinical trials to treat DME. We intend to initiate NORSE 4, 5 and 6 in 2020 after completion of enrollment in NORSE 2.
 
NORSE 1
 
NORSE 1 completed enrollment in August 2019 with a total of 61 patients at nine sites in Australia. The study is the first of two ongoing, clinical trials evaluating ONS-5010 against ranibizumab for wet AMD. The endpoint for the study is a mean change in baseline visual acuity at 11 months for ONS-5010 dosed on a monthly basis compared to ranibizumab dosed using the PIER alternative dosing regimen of three monthly doses followed by quarterly dosing. We currently expect to announce a readout of the topline results from NORSE 1 in the third quarter of calendar year 2020.
NORSE 2
 
NORSE 2 is the second of our two required clinical trials evaluating ONS-5010 against ranibizumab for wet AMD. We began enrolling patients in July 2019, and the study is expected to enroll a total of at least 220 patients at sites in the United States. Patients enrolled in the ONS-5010-002 study will be treated for 11 months. The endpoint for the study is a mean increase in baseline visual acuity of at least five letters at 11 months for ONS-5010 dosed on a monthly basis compared to ranibizumab dosed using the approved PIER alternative dosing regimen of three-monthly doses followed by quarterly dosing. We currently anticipate full enrollment for NORSE 2 in the first quarter of calendar year 2020.
Inactive Development Portfolio
 
ONS-3010 — Adalimumab (Humira) Biosimilar
 
Humira, the reference product for ONS-3010, is a subcutaneous injectable mAb that binds to tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNFα. TNFα belongs to a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or soluble protein mediators, that are key initiators of immune-mediated inflammation in many different diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Several biologic agents, including Humira, have been developed to inhibit the inflammatory activity of TNFs in the context of these diseases and are collectively referred to as the anti-TNF class of therapeutics.
 
We have successfully completed a randomized, double-blind, single-dose and single-center Phase 1 clinical trial comparing ONS-3010 to Humira in 198 subjects receiving a 40mg dose in three treatment arms: ONS-3010, U.S.-Humira and E.U.-Humira. This Phase 1 clinical trial was performed at the Center for Human Drug Research in Leiden, the Netherlands under the auspices of the Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek. In this trial, ONS-3010 met its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating a similar PK profile, as well as an immunogenicity profile equivalent to both U.S. - and E.U.-Humira across all three treatment arms. ONS-3010 was well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, which was similar to the safety profile for both U.S.- and E.U.-Humira and demonstrated a lower injection site reaction rate than both U.S.- and E.U.-Humira.

Regulatory Status and Development Plan
 
Prior to commencement of our Phase 1 clinical trial in 2014, we received feedback from both FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which provided guidance for the design of the clinical trial and our similarity testing approach. Since completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, we had additional regulatory meetings with the FDA and the EMA, as well as other national regulatory agencies such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the Swedish Medical Products Agency, and the Canadian regulatory agency, Health Canada, to obtain further guidance on the Phase 3 clinical trial design in plaque psoriasis and the general similarity development plan for registration. We have out-licensed all of the emerging markets development rights to third parties. Future development of ONS-3010 as a biosimilar for Humira in the United States and other developed markets will only occur if we secure a development partner or sell those development rights completely.
ONS-1045 — Bevacizumab (Avastin) Biosimilar
 
Avastin, the reference product for ONS-1045, is a mAb administered by infusion that interferes with tumor growth by binding to VEGF, a protein that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels and is approved for use in the United States, Europe and elsewhere for the treatment of various forms of cancer.
 
We have completed a randomized, double-blind, single-dose and single-center Phase 1 clinical trial comparing ONS-1045 to U.S.-licensed Avastin and E.U.-licensed Avastin in 135 subjects. This Phase 1 trial was performed at the Center for Human Drug Research in Leiden, the Netherlands under the auspices of the Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek. PK data, safety and immunogenicity were collected for a total of 98 days after a single 2.0 mg/kg dose. In this trial, ONS-1045 met its primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a similar PK profile, as well as an immunogenicity profile equivalent to both U.S.- and E.U.-Avastin. Safety was comparable across all three groups. Immunogenicity was low with only one subject in the E.U.-licensed Avastin arm developing an anti-drug antibody, or ADA, at day 98. No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any arm. The results of the Phase 1 trial (shown in the figure included under “—Active Development Portfolio — ONS-5010 — Bevacizumab for Ophthalmic Use”) suggest a high degree of similarity between the three products.
 
Regulatory Status and Development Plan
 
Prior to the commencement of the Phase 1 clinical trial in 2015, we received feedback from both the FDA and the EMA, which provided guidance for the clinical trial design and similarity testing approach. We have completed the next series of our regulatory interactions to obtain further guidance on our confirmatory trial design. Based on input from the FDA, EMA, MHRA and the Danish Health and Medicines Agency, we believe we have designed the appropriate confirmatory trial. We have outlicensed all of the emerging markets development rights to third parties. Future development of ONS-1045 as a biosimilar for Avastin in the United States and other developed markets will only occur if we secure a development partner or sell those development rights completely.
Commercialization, Sales and Marketing
 
We currently own all of the development and commercialization rights to ONS-5010. Our commercialization strategy is to maximize the revenue potential of ONS-5010, which could potentially include marketing it ourselves if approved, as well as seeking and securing licensing opportunities to fund its continued development. If approved, we believe that ONS-5010 will be entitled to 12 years marketing exclusivity against biosimilar competition.
 
For many years, anti-VEGF therapy has been the standard of care for many ophthalmic diseases, including wet AMD, DME and BRVO. However, although multiple branded drugs have been approved for these indications (e.g., LUCENTIS, EYLEA and BEOVU), they are very expensive. Doctors who wish to treat their retinal patients with a less expensive anti-VEGF drug often use bevacizumab. But because there is no FDA-approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab, doctors must use repackaged bevacizumab (Avastin) provided by compounding pharmacists. Despite clinicians’ widespread acceptance and use of bevacizumab to treat ophthalmic diseases such as wet AMD, DME and BRVO, no manufacturer has previously sought approval from FDA of bevacizumab for these purposes.
 
The repackaged bevacizumab for ophthalmic use that is provided by compounding pharmacies can carry known risks of contamination (including silicone oil droplet contamination from syringes) and inconsistent potency, with potentially severe consequences, as leading retinal societies have reported. For these reasons, the retina community and payors have shown interest in the development of an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab that could be an on-label alternative to repackaged bevacizumab from compounding pharmacists.

To meet this retinal market need, we are developing ONS-5010 as an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab. If approved, it will provide an FDA-approved and European Agency-approved, viable treatment option across the spectrum of anti-VEGF ophthalmic drugs that treat wet AMD, DME and BRVO. Additionally, if approved, it would avoid the safety, sterility, potency, availability and syringe drawbacks that can occur with repackaged bevacizumab from compounding pharmacies.
 
Additionally, if ONS-5010 is approved and commercialized, we expect to price it responsibly to help mitigate the high cost of on-label treatment for retinal diseases. Both in the U.S. and globally, the high cost of treating retinal diseases such as wet AMD, DME and BRVO can result in patients receiving an insufficient number of treatments, or potentially no treatment at all. Our commercial strategy includes a focus on becoming the step therapy of choice for retinal diseases for branded and long acting options. where an anti-VEGF therapy is indicated. Step therapy is a type of prior authorization for drugs that begins treatment for a medical condition with the most preferred drug therapy and progresses to other therapies only if necessary.
 
By ensuring the consistent availability of safe, sterile and fully potent on-label bevacizumab for intravitreal injection, at a responsible price, ONS-5010, if approved, has the potential to become the anti-VEGF cornerstone of care for retinal diseases. It may also provide synergies with future long-acting agents and adjunct therapies for advanced treatment of wet AMD, DME and BRVO. ONS-5010 has the potential, if approved and commercialized with a responsible pricing strategy, to help lower the aggregate costs of treating retinal diseases for the overall healthcare system.
 
To provide additional resources to fund the ONS-5010 program, in addition to pursuing potential strategic collaborations and partnerships for ONS-5010, we also intend to continue to pursue potential strategic collaborations, and partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and other regions for our clinical stage biosimilar assets, or even the outright sale of the development rights of these assets outside of the emerging markets territories previously licensed. Currently, we have a joint participation agreement in place for ONS-3010 with Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Huahai, whereby we share post-Phase 1 development costs with Huahai, and proportionately share the revenues from commercialization of ONS-3010 in the United States, Canada, European Union, or E.U., Japan, Australia and New Zealand. We could also be required to form a joint venture to further develop and commercialize ONS-3010 with Huahai in the agreed countries, if so, requested by Huahai. However, we do not have any other development and commercialization agreements for the United States or for major ex-U.S. markets, such as the E.U. and Japan.
 
For emerging markets opportunities, in 2012 and 2013, we established early country-specific partnerships for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in China with Huahai, in India with IPCA Laboratories Limited, or IPCA, and in Mexico with Laboratories Liomont, S.A. de C.V., or Liomont, and in September 2017 we entered into an agreement with BioLexis Pte. Ltd., or BioLexis, our controlling stockholder, providing for the license of rights to ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in emerging markets excluding China, India and Mexico. To date, these agreements have collectively provided an aggregate of $29.0 million in payments as of September 30, 2019.
 
Collaboration and License Agreements
 
We enter into collaboration and license agreements in the ordinary course of our business. We have in-licensed certain technology from Selexis SA, or Selexis, that we used to research and develop our product candidates. For product candidates developed using the Selexis technology, we enter into commercial license agreements with Selexis that give us rights to commercialize, file investigational new drugs, or INDs and enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties for the further development and commercialization of such biosimilar product candidates.

MTTR — Strategic Partnership Agreement (ONS-5010)
 
In February 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership agreement with MTTR, LLC, or MTTR, to advise on regulatory, clinical and commercial strategy and assist in obtaining approval of ONS-5010, our bevacizumab therapeutic product candidate for ophthalmic indications. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid MTTR a $58,333 monthly consulting fee through December 2018. Beginning January 2019, the monthly fee increased to $105,208 per month, and then, after launch of ONS-5010 in the United States, will increase to $170,833 per month (the amount of which is reduced by 50% in the event net sales of ONS-5010 are below a certain threshold million per year). We also agreed to pay MTTR a tiered percentage of the net profits of ONS-5010 ranging in the low- to mid-teens, with the ability to credit monthly fees paid to MTTR. In March 2018, we amended the MTTR agreement and agreed to pay a one-time fee of $268,553 to MTTR by September 2020 if certain regulatory milestones are achieved earlier than anticipated. In June 2019, we entered into a further amendment of our strategic partnership agreement with MTTR pursuant to which we increased the aggregate monthly payments to MTTR under the existing agreement from $105,208 to $170,724 through December 2019 by adding an additional monthly retainer of $115,516, and an offset of $50,000 to the existing monthly retainer while the additional monthly retainer is in effect. MTTR earned an aggregate $1,744,933 and $602,629 during the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which includes monthly consulting fees and expense reimbursement. 
 
Unless earlier terminated, the MTTR agreement expires, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of expiration of any regulatory exclusivity in such country and, in certain major market countries, ten years after launch of ONS-5010 in such major market country, and in all other countries in the territory, ten years after launch of ONS-5010 in any country in the territory. Either party may terminate the MTTR agreement upon the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or upon a bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. Additionally, we are permitted to terminate the MTTR agreement in the event of certain specified development or commercial failures of ONS-5010 and may terminate either the entire MTTR agreement or with respect to certain consultants in the event that certain consultants are not able to perform their obligations under the MTTR Agreement, and a suitable replacement consultant is not found. Additionally, in the event of a change of control of our company or sale of our rights to ONS-5010, MTTR will be entitled to additional consideration equal to its profit-sharing percentage multiplied by the value of the applicable transaction that relates to ONS-5010 (subject to certain adjustments).
 
In November 2018 we appointed Terry Dagnon as our Chief Operating Officer and Jeff Evanson as our Chief Commercial Officer. Although each is an executive officer of our company, they are providing services to us pursuant to our strategic partnership agreement with MTTR, are compensated by MTTR, and each has an ownership interest in MTTR. See also Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—MTTR LLC - ONS 5010 Strategic Partnership Agreement.”
 
Selexis — Humira (ONS-3010), Avastin (ONS-5010 and ONS-1045) and Herceptin (ONS-1050)
 
In October 2011, we entered into a research license agreement with Selexis, whereby we acquired a non-exclusive license to conduct research internally or in collaboration with third parties to develop recombinant proteins from cell lines created in mammalian cells using the Selexis expression technology, or the Selexis Technology. The research license expired on October 9, 2018, and accordingly, we are no longer using the Selexis Technology in our research.
 
Selexis also granted us a non-transferrable option to obtain a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide commercial license under the Selexis Technology to manufacture, or have manufactured, a recombinant protein produced by a cell line developed using the Selexis Technology for clinical testing and commercial sale. We exercised this option in April 2013 and entered into three commercial license agreements with Selexis for our ONS-3010, ONS-1045 (which covers ONS-5010) and ONS-1050 product candidates. We paid an upfront licensing fee to Selexis for each commercial license and also agreed to pay a fixed milestone payment for each licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay a single-digit royalty on a final product-by-final product and country-by-country basis, based on worldwide net sales of such final products by us or any of our affiliates or sub-licensees during the royalty term. At any time during the term, we have the right to terminate our royalty payment obligation by providing written notice to Selexis and paying Selexis a royalty termination fee.
 
Commercial License Agreements
 
On April 11, 2013, following the exercise of our option to enter a commercial license under the Selexis research license, we entered into commercial license agreements with Selexis for each of the ONS-3010, ONS-1045 and ONS-1050 (a biosimilar to Herceptin that we are no longer developing) biosimilar product candidates that were developed under the research license (which agreements were subsequently amended on May 21, 2014). Under the terms of each commercial license agreement, we acquired a non-exclusive worldwide license under the Selexis Technology to use the cell lines developed under the research license and related materials, to manufacture and commercialize licensed and final products, with a limited right to sublicense.

We were required to pay an upfront licensing fee of CHF 65,000 (approximately $0.1 million) to Selexis for each commercial license and also agreed to pay up to CHF 365,000 (approximately $0.4 million) in milestone payments for each licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay a single-digit royalty on a final product-by-final product and country-by-country basis, based on worldwide net sales of such final products by us or any of our affiliates or sublicensees during the royalty term. The royalty term for each final product in each country is the period commencing from the first commercial sale of the applicable final product in the applicable country and ending on the expiration of the specified patent coverage. At any time during the term, we have the right to terminate our royalty payment obligation by providing written notice to Selexis and paying Selexis a royalty termination fee of CHF 1,750,000 (approximately $1.8 million). The initiation of our Phase 3 clinical program for ONS-5010 in fiscal 2019 triggered a CHF 65,000 (approximately $0.1 million) milestone payment to Selexis under the commercial license agreement, which we paid in November, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, we have paid Selexis an aggregate of approximately $0.4 million under the commercial license agreements.
 
Each of our commercial agreements with Selexis will expire in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable Selexis patent rights. The licensed patent rights consist of two patent families. The first patent family relates to methods of transferring cells, and is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and Singapore. This patent family will begin to expire worldwide in 2022. The second patent family claims DNA compositions of matter useful for having protein production increasing activity. This patent family is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Singapore and South Africa. This patent family will begin to expire worldwide in 2025. Either party may terminate the related agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, winding up or similar circumstances.
 
Either party may also terminate the related agreement under designated circumstances if the Selexis Technology infringes third-party intellectual property rights. In addition, we have the right to terminate each of the commercial agreements at any time for our convenience; however, with respect to the agreements relating to ONS-3010 and ONS-1045, this right is subject to Liomont’s consent pursuant to a corresponding letter we executed in conjunction with the standby agreement entered into between Selexis and Liomont on November 11, 2014. The standby agreement permits Liomont to assume the license under the applicable commercial agreement for Mexico upon specified triggering events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances.
 
Ex-U.S. Collaboration and License Agreements
 
Aside from our joint participation agreement in place for ONS-3010 with Huahai, whereby we agreed to share post-Phase 1 clinical development costs, and proportionately share the revenues from commercialization of ONS-3010 in the United States, Canada, E.U. and Japan, among other markets, and under which we could be required to form a joint venture with Huahai for ONS-3010 if so requested by Huahai, we do not have any commercial license or development agreements for the United States or for major ex-U.S. markets, such as the E.U. or Japan. We currently have collaboration and license agreements for smaller ex-U.S. markets and, collectively, such agreements have provided an aggregate of $29.0 million in payments as of September 30, 2019 for our most advanced biosimilar product candidates. Our contracts include agreements with IPCA (for ONS-3010, ONS-1045 and ONS-1050 in India and other regional markets), Liomont (for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in Mexico), Huahai (for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in China) and BioLexis (for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in emerging markets excluding China, India and Mexico). Our arrangements with these partners generally include a strategic license for a defined territory for agreed biosimilar product candidates and may also include agreements to assist with research and development to assist our contract counterparty in establishing their own mAb research, development and manufacturing capabilities. Under our existing strategic licensing agreements, we generally received an upfront payment upon execution, and have the ability to earn additional regular milestone payments and the right to receive royalties (generally a mid-single digit to low-teens percentage rate) based on net sales in the agreed territory. Our existing agreements to assist with research and development also included an upfront payment upon execution, and we have the ability to earn additional regular milestone payments, and the right to receive royalties (generally a mid-single digit to low-teens percentage rate) based on net sales in the agreed territory.

Generally, our agreements expire on a product-by-product basis on the date of the expiration of the royalty revenue term for all products in the territory. The royalty revenue term is 10 years from the date of first commercial sale and any renewal is subject to good faith negotiation. The license term for the agreed territory is perpetual. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular product if the other party materially breaches the agreement, subject to specified notice and cure periods. In addition, we have the right to terminate the agreement in connection with any interference, opposition or challenge of our patent rights. If the agreement is terminated due to our breach, our contract counterparty is generally free to use all applicable technology and know-how that we have provided under the agreement.
 
As noted above, our collaboration agreements with Huahai also includes a joint participation agreement, which provides for the co-funding of development of ONS-3010 in the United States, Canada, E.U., Japan, Australia and New Zealand and the proportionate sharing of the revenues from commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries, and also provides for the formation of a joint venture with Huahai to further develop and commercialize ONS-3010 with Huahai in the agreed countries, if so requested by Huahai.
 
In the event Huahai funds its proportionate share of development costs incurred after completion of the “Phase-3 Ready Package,” Huahai would be entitled to retain its 51% value ownership, with us entitled to retain our 49% value ownership, of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries. Similarly, revenues from the commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries (including major markets such as the United States and the E.U., among others), would also be shared based on such proportional ownership interests. In the event that Huahai does not fund its proportionate share of such development costs, the joint participation agreement provides for a proportionate adjustment to our respective value ownership interests based on our respective investments in such development costs, which would increase our value ownership interest in ONS-3010.
 
Throughout the term of the joint participation agreement, we and our affiliates are prohibited from, directly or indirectly, conducting or having conducted or funding any discovery, research, development, regulatory, manufacturing or commercialization activity, alone or in collaboration with a third party, of any biosimilar product having the same reference product as the ONS-3010 compound or corresponding products, for use in the United States, Canada, E.U., Japan, Australia and New Zealand, other than ONS-3010 with Huahai pursuant to the joint participation agreement.
 
Unless terminated early upon mutual agreement of the parties, or due to a material breach of either party that is uncured, the joint participation agreement will terminate upon entry into a mutually acceptable collaboration agreement between us and Huahai for ongoing development and commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries, or we and Huahai enter into an agreed license with a third party for such ongoing development and commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries. If the joint participation agreement is terminated for cause due to our breach, we could be required to refund Huahai any amounts funded by Huahai to develop ONS-3010, as well as pay Huahai a 6% royalty on net sales made by us or an affiliate, as well as 25% of revenues we receive from a sublicensee for commercial sales of ONS-3010 until the aggregate of such payments is equal to 10 times the amount Huahai funded for the development of ONS-3010.
 
Furthermore, if we were to file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or have an involuntary petition filed that we could not dismiss within 120 days, then Huahai would be granted an exclusive license to continue the development and commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries.
 
As of September 30, 2019, we have received an aggregate of $5.0 million of payments from IPCA under our various agreements, an aggregate of $3.0 million of payments from Liomont under our various agreements, an aggregate of $16.0 million of payments from Huahai under our various agreements, $10.0 million of which were pursuant to the joint participation agreement and an aggregate of $5.0 million from BioLexis under our joint development and licensing agreement.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the area of pharmaceutical research and development is intense and significantly depends on scientific and technological factors. These factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We are aware of certain other products manufactured or under development by competitors that are used for the treatment of the health conditions that we have targeted for product development. We can provide no assurance that developments by others will not render our technology obsolete, noncompetitive or harm our development strategy, that we will be able to keep pace with new technological developments or that our technology will be able to supplant established products and methodologies in the therapeutic areas that are targeted by us. The foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.

We will encounter competition from existing firms that offer competitive solutions in ocular diseases. These competitive companies could develop products that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance, than the products being developed by us. We will have to compete against other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with greater market recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources.
 
Wet-AMD Market
 
AMD is a medical condition that usually affects older adults and generally results in a loss of vision. AMD occurs in “dry” (non-exudative) and “wet” (exudative) forms. Wet AMD is the advanced form of macular degeneration that involves the formation of abnormal and leaky blood vessels in the back of the eye behind the retina, through a process known as choroidal neovascularization. While the wet form accounts for approximately 15% of all AMD cases, according to the National Eye Institute, it is responsible for 90% of severe vision loss associated with AMD. The National Eye Institute also estimates that the prevalence of wet AMD among adults 40 years or older in the United States is approximately 1.75 million people. In addition, more than 200,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in North America.
 
Competitive Landscape in Wet-AMD
 
Off-label use of bevacizumab (Avastin) is estimated to be at least 50% of the overall market in the United States. The current FDA approved market leaders for the treatment of wet AMD are VEGF inhibitors, including LUCENTIS and EYLEA. Annual revenue (worldwide) was approximately $9.0 billion in 2018 for the approved anti-VEGF therapeutics LUCENTIS and EYLEA alone. Additionally, in 2019, BEOVU (brolucizumbab-dbll) was approved by the FDA as another anti-VEGF for the treatment of wet AMD. Bevacizumab, LUCENTIS, EYLEA and BEOVU are all administered via frequent intravitreal injections directly into the eye. We are developing ONS-5010 as an approved bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD, as well as DME and BRVO.
 
In addition to the other treatments used in patients with wet AMD, there are various other companies with product candidates in Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials for the treatment of wet AMD. Programs currently in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials include, but are not limited to:
 

• | Abicipar Pegol, a VEGF targeting DARPin molecule being developed by Allergan plc;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | X-82, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed by Tyrogenex, Inc.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ALG-1001, an integrin targeting peptide being developed by Allegro Ophthalmics LLC;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Zimura, a C-3 inhibitor being developed by Ophthotech Corporation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RG7716, a bispecific antibody to both VEGF-A and Ang2 being developed by Hoffman-La Roche AG;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | OPT-302, an inhibitor of VEGF-C and VEGF-D being developed by Opthea Limited; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PAN-90806, a selective inhibitor of VEGF being developed by PanOptica Inc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of these product candidates in clinical development, with the exception of X-82 and PAN-90806, use an intravitreal route of administration much like the current standards of care. We believe that ONS-5010 has potential competitive advantages through the familiarity of patients and physicians in using off-label Avastin. We also believe we have reduced the risk in our clinical program by leveraging our prior work in developing a biosmilar drug product candidate for Avastin as a treatment for cancer. However, clinical trial data from other clinical programs may negatively impact our ability to garner future financing or business collaborations, combinations or transactions with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies where applicable and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by, among other methods, evaluating relevant patents, establishing defensive positions, monitoring E.U. oppositions and pending intellectual property rights, preparing litigation strategies in view of the U.S. legislative framework and filing U.S. and international patent applications on technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. As of September 30, 2019, we own one U.S. patent, one foreign patent, seven pending U.S. non-provisional applications, and 50 pending international applications that were nationalized from eight Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications, and one pending PCT application, which relate to formulations developed for ONS-3010, ONS-5010/ONS-1045 and ONS-1050, methods of antibody purification, methods for purifying antibodies to separate isoforms, methods of use, methods of reducing high molecular weight species, and modulating afucosylated species as well as efficiently determining the amino acid sequence of antibodies. Our first PCT application was nationalized in April 2016 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these nine applications are expected to expire in 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our second PCT application was nationalized in July 2017 in Europe and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these two applications are expected to expire in 2036, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our third PCT application was nationalized in June 2018 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these eight applications are expected to expire in 2036, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our fourth PCT application was nationalized in July 2018 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these eight applications are expected to expire in 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our fifth PCT application was nationalized in July 2018 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these eight applications are expected to expire in 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our sixth PCT application was nationalized in July 2018 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these eight applications are expected to expire in 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our seventh PCT application was nationalized in August 2018 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these eight applications are expected to expire in 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our eighth PCT application was nationalized in August 2018 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these eight applications are expected to expire in 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. Any patents that may eventually issue claiming priority to our provisional patent application are expected to expire in 2039. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
 
Regulatory
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
 
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11
--


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development
 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 

• | Phase 1 — The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 — The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 — The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so- called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
BLA Submission and Review
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors expose us to broadly applicable healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, either to induce or award the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, recommending or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on, in certain cases, sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or federal civil monetary penalties statute.
 
Additionally, the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government has used the civil False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes requirements regarding the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, for covered entities, or certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates that provide services to the covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA.
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, via the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Certain states also impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states and local governments require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. State laws may also apply that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers or other potential referral sources. In addition, certain states require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures or drug pricing. In addition, state and local laws may require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. We may also be subject to, and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Healthcare Reform
 
The Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing or delaying penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. Additionally, on December 15, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the current presidential administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act has on our business. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers. In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposals for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation. In addition, the current presidential administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has started soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is implementing others under its existing authority. While some of these measures may require additional authorization to become effective, U.S. Congress and the Trump administration have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Although a number of these, and other measures may require authorization to become effective, Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The Affordable Care Act, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues.
International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, foreign regulations also govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates within their jurisdiction. The regulatory approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, the approval of a biosimilar for marketing is based on an opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency and a decision issued by the European Commission. However, substitution of a biosimilar for the innovator is a decision that is made at the local (national) level on a country-by-country basis. Additionally, a number of European countries do not permit the automatic substitution of biosimilars for the reference product. Many countries also have published their own legislation outlining a regulatory pathway for the development and approval of biosimilars. In some cases, countries have either adopted European guidance or are following guidance issued by the World Health Organization. Although similarities are apparent across these various regulatory guidance, there is also the potential for additional country-specific requirements.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of drug products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly drug products. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As such, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our product candidates, once approved, may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement compared to existing approved biologics and other therapies. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs in the United States, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
