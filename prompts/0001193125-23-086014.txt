On February 7, 2023, the SEC declared effective our registration statement on Form 10. Each Crane Holdings, Co. stockholder will receive one share of Crane Company common stock for every one share of Crane Holdings, Co. common stock held on March 23, 2023, the record date for the distribution. 
 For additional information regarding the Separation, including risk factors, see the Information Statement of Crane Company, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the registration statement on Form 10 filed by Crane Company with the SEC on December 15, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed with the SEC on January 24, 2023. 
 Crane Company Credit Facilities
On March 17, 2023, Crane Company entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), which provides for (i) a $500 million, 5-year Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolving Facility) and (ii) a $300 million, 3-year term loan facility (the Term Facility), funding under each of which will become available substantially concurrently with the spin-off, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions of facilities of this type. The Revolving Facility allows us to borrow, repay and re-borrow funds from time to time prior to maturity of the Revolving Facility without any penalty or premium, subject to customary borrowing conditions for facilities of this type and the reimbursement of breakage costs. Borrowings under the Term Facility are prepayable without premium or penalty, subject to customary reimbursement of breakage costs. Interest on loans advanced under the Credit Agreement accrues, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to (1) adjusted term SOFR for the applicable interest period plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% or (2) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.25%, in each case, with such margin determined based on our total net leverage ratio. We are required to pay a fee on undrawn commitments under the Revolving Facility at a rate per annum that ranges from 0.20% to 0.35%, depending on our total net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on us and our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and hedging arrangements. As of the last day of each quarter, we must also maintain a total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00 (which, at the Crane Companys election, such maximum ratio may be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for specified periods following our consummation of certain material acquisitions) and a minimum interest coverage ratio must be at least 3.00 to 1.00.

Manufacturing facilities are located in the United States. 
 Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole
Competitive Conditions
Our businesses participate in markets that are highly competitive. Because of the diversity of products manufactured and sold, our businesses typically have a different set of competitors in each geographic area and end market in which they participate. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the number of competitors, or precise market share; however, we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our markets. Our primary basis of competition is providing high quality products, with technological differentiation, at competitive prices, with superior customer service and timely delivery. 
 Our products are sold into primary end markets which include aerospace, defense and space, process industries, non-residential and municipal construction, along with a wide range of general industrial and certain consumer related end markets. As such, our revenues depend on numerous unpredictable factors, including changes in market demand, general economic conditions, customer capital spending, timing and amount of contract awards and credit availability. Since our products are sold in such a wide variety of markets, we do not believe that we can reliably quantify or predict the potential effects of changes in any of the aforementioned factors. Our engineering and product development activities are focused on improving existing products, customizing existing products for particular customer requirements, as well as the development of new products. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property, no one of which is of such importance that termination would materially affect our business. From time to time, however, we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property. 
 Raw Materials
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics, and various petroleum-based products. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. Although market forces have at times, including in 2022, caused increases in the costs of key raw materials, there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business. We believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at acceptable costs. For a further discussion of risks related to raw materials, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
10 


 Government Contracts
We have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in our Aerospace & Electronics and, to a lesser extent, our Process Flow Technologies segment. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts. For example, some government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Environmental Compliance and Climate Change
We are regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce significant volumes or quantities of byproducts that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment if not properly handled or maintained. Accordingly, continued compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures or earnings. 
 However, we occasionally engage in environmental remediation activities as required by federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in the characterization and remediation of federal Superfund sites, or analogous state sites. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. For further discussion of environmental related risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. For further discussion of our environmental matters, please refer to Part II, Item 8 under Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Combined Financial Statements. 
 Human Capital Resources
To remain a leading manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products, it is important that we continue to attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent across our global enterprise. 
 The Company has a diverse global workforce located in 20 countries, spanning six continents. At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 7,000 persons worldwide, of which substantially all were full time employees. In the United States, we employed approximately 4,000 people across 35 locations. At December 31, 2022, approximately 5% of our U.S. employees were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. Employees based in some foreign countries may, from time to time, be represented by works councils or unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
 To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our associates. We are committed to developing our associates personally and professionally by leveraging a structured and disciplined Intellectual Capital (IC) process. Our regular IC cadence includes constructive reviews and various talent and leadership development initiatives conducted by the executive management team and provided throughout an associates career. We are also committed to an inclusive and high-performance culture at all levels of the organization, based on trust and respect. 
 The manufacture and production of our products requires the use of a variety of tools, equipment, materials, and supplies. At Crane, we are strongly committed to the health and safety of our associates and strive to continuously adhere to global regulatory safety requirements and to reduce the incidence and severity of job-related injuries. We utilize strict compliance protocols, training programs, effective risk management practices, and sound science in our operations to minimize risk to our associates.

 Beginning in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented flexible remote work options and health and safety protocols and procedures across all of our global offices, manufacturing and distribution facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates. These protocols included proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use and temperature screenings and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S., and other similar public health authorities in our international locations. Today, we continue to deploy various work options and protocols in response to the significantly reduced health risks compared to the initial and early period of the pandemic. 
 For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
