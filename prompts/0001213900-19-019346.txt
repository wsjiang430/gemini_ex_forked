Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 
Esports is the competitive playing of video games by amateur and professional teams for cash prizes. Esports typically takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter and multiplayer online battle arena games. As of March 20, 2019, the three largest selling esports games were Dota 2, League of Legends (each multiplayer online battle arena games) and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (a first-person shooter game). Other popular games include Smite, StarCraft II, Call of Duty¸ Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone and Fortnite. Esports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions on the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and WII (Nintendo). Most major professional esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events are broadcast live via streaming services including twitch.tv, azubu.tv, ustream.tv and youtube.com.
 
Esports Entertainment Group, Inc. (“Esports,” “EEG,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) operates a licensed online gambling platform focused purely on the esports industry. Utilizing our peer-to-peer wagering system, we offer real money betting exchange style wagering on esports events from around the world in a secure environment. A betting exchange allows players to bet against one another rather than a bookmaker. Players can offer odds to, or request odds from, other players who wish to wager. Where traditional bookmakers risk going head-to-head with gamblers on markets, a betting exchange takes on no risk on the particular outcome of an event. Instead, a betting exchange provides the platform for its customers to match bets against one another and takes a small commission on winnings. Betting exchanges are becoming an increasingly integral part of the global gambling landscape, in many cases enabling customers to obtain better odds, more transparency and an experience that feels intuitively fairer. We believe that we are currently the only online gambling company focused on esports to offer bet exchange style wagering or player versus player (“PvP”) betting, on professional esports events.
 
At the current time, under the terms of our existing Curacao license, we are currently able to accept wagers from residents of over 149 jurisdictions including Canada, Japan, Germany and South Africa. We have applied for a gaming service license from the Malta Gaming Authority. If our application is approved and a license is issued, we expect that residents in a number of European Union member states will be able to place bets on our website. We are also able to accept payments from additional third party payment providers. Money Matrix, a licensed regulated financial institution and our third party payment platform, updates the jurisdictions we are able to accept bets from on a real time basis as these changes occur. When customers open an account on our website, they are required to make a deposit and Money Matrix displays a list of payment options available to that person based on the jurisdiction they are located in. It is expected that if and when we acquire additional gaming licenses, additional payment options will become available to us and we will be able to accept bets in additional jurisdictions. Money Matrix automatically updates our website with additional payment options as they negotiate with various payment providers.
 
Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a global surge in popularity over the last few years with the rapid growth of online streaming. The advent of online streaming has turned esports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in-person in stadiums and by online viewers, which regularly exceed 1,000,000 for major tournaments. The impact has been so significant that many video game developers are now building features into their games designed to facilitate competition.
 
According to Newzoo, a global leader in esports, games and mobile intelligence, it is expected the total global esports audience will reach 453.8 million in 2019. Esports Enthusiasts, which are people who watch professional esports content at least once a month, will make up 201.2 million of the total up from 143.2 million in 2017, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of +15.7% (2017-2022) to reach almost 297 million in 2022. The global average revenue per Esports Enthusiast, which includes not only gaming revenue, but also sponsorships, advertising and all other esports related revenues, is projected to be $5.45 in 2019, up 8.9% from $5.00 in 2018. The number of occasional esports viewers (people who watch professional esports content less than once a month) is expected to reach 252.6 million in 2019, up from 221.6 million in 2018, and is projected to grow with a CAGR of +12.6% to surpass 347 million in 2022. The number of people who are aware of esports worldwide is expected to reach 1.8 billion in 2019, up from 1.6 billion in 2018. China is expected to contribute most to global esports awareness, with 500.2 million people aware of esports in 2019. The increasing prominence of esports as a mainstream entertainment industry is driving the growth in awareness in most regions. Audience and awareness growth in the emerging regions of Latin
 
America, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, and Rest of Asia is largely driven by improving IT infrastructure and urbanization. We believe the rise of new franchises, such as Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds or PubG, is an important global growth factor as the influx of millennials should continue to drive the growth of the industry’s audience.
 
In 2018, there were 737 major esports events that generated an estimated $54.7 million in ticket revenues, up from $32 million in 2016, but down from 58.9 million in 2017. The total prize money of all esports events held in 2018 reached $150.8 million, after breaking the $100 million mark for the first time in 2017. The League of Legends World Championship was 2018’s biggest tournament by live viewership hours on Twitch, with 53.8 million hours. It also produced $1.9 million in ticket revenues. The Overwatch League was the most-watched league by live viewership hours on Twitch, generating 79.5 million hours.
 
According to Statista, the amounts wagered on esports betting is expected to grow from $3.15 million in 2015 to $23.5 billion in 2020. Forbes magazine projects fans of eSports will wager $23 billion on professional esports events by 2020. We believe as the size of the market and the number of esports enthusiasts continues to grow, so will the number of esports enthusiasts gambling on the events will also continue to grow, making our platform more in demand.

History
 
Esports Entertainment Group, Inc. was formed in the State of Nevada on July 22, 2008 under our prior name Virtual Closet, Inc. Virtual Closet, Inc. changed its name to DK Sinopharma, Inc. on June 6, 2010. DK Sinopharma, Inc. changed its name to VGambling, Inc. on August 12, 2014. On or about April 24, 2017, VGambling, Inc. changed its name to Esports Entertainment Group, Inc. Our company was engaged in a number of different enterprises up until May 20, 2013, when, pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of H&H Arizona Corporation in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of our common stock. From May 2013 until August 2018, our operations were limited to designing, developing and testing our wagering systems. We launched our online esports wagering website (www.vie.gg) in August 2018.
 
Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths
 
We believe the following strengths position us for sustainable growth:
 
Management Team and Key Personnel Experience: Our Board of Directors includes senior managers with extensive experience in online gambling, esports, information technology, compliance, regulation, accounting and finance. Our Officers and Senior Managers include individuals with extensive experience in online gambling, esports, information technology, marketing, business development, payment processing, compliance, regulation, accounting, finance and customer service.
 
Licensed Technology/IP: We are currently party to an exclusive software licensing agreement for our bet exchange software platform (the “Licensed Software”) with Swiss Interactive Software (GmbH) Switzerland (“Swiss Interactive”), a company controlled by Yan Rozum, our previous Chief Technology Officer and a former member of the board of directors. We believe our bet exchange platform provides us with a first mover advantage, as we believe that we are currently the only bet exchange platform in the esports wagering market. Virtually all other companies offering esports wagering are using the “bookie” model whereby the player wagers against the house. Our Licensed Software requires complex code and very skilled development, as opposed to the software used for bookie style wagering which is widely available and easily reproduced. Accordingly, we believe the complexity of our licensed software and bet exchange platform offers a higher barrier to entry than standard wagering platforms.
 
On April 7, 2019, we entered into a software transfer agreement with Swiss Interactive for the purchase of the Licensed Software for consideration of $1,700,000, the consummation of which is contingent upon either the Company’s completion of a (i) any private placement offerings or registered public offerings pursuant to which the Company received proceeds in excess of $6,000,000 or (ii) any private or public offerings in connection with the listing of the Company’s securities on a national securities exchange (“Qualified Offering”). If the Company does not complete a Qualified Offering within six months of the execution date of the transfer agreement, such agreement becomes void and the Company and Swiss Interactive are required to continue to abide by the terms of the existing agreement on the Licensed Software.
 
Affiliate Marketing Program: Our affiliate marketing program focuses on professional esports teams and individual social media influencers. As part of our efforts to market our online gaming services, we attempt to enter into “Affiliate Marketing Agreements” with professional esports teams and other influential individuals and groups within esports. As an Affiliate, the esports team will provide their fans with a link to our online gaming website, where the fan, if located in a country which allows the fan to place a bet using our gaming platform, can bet on teams playing in esports tournaments.
 
For a player placing a bet through the marketing affiliate’s link to our website and provided such player wins the bet, we pay the Affiliate a percentage of the amount we collect from the winning bet. We believe our PvP wagering model allows us to attract and retain affiliate marketing partners who participate directly in the revenues generated by their referrals to our website. In addition, our affiliate marketing partners are paid fees between 25% and 35% of revenues that they generate through their own client base or fan base, depending upon the system they employ. Instead of the Company incurring significant costs related to online advertising, which must be paid for in advance, this system allows us to spend less resources on advertising directly because our affiliate partners market to their own client or fan bases for us. Because our affiliate marketing partners have defined clients and fan bases already interested in esports and or wagering, we believe this program not only affords the Company savings related to marketing expense, but also serves as an avenue for direct or targeted marketing which would presumably lead to increased traffic on our website.

Growth Strategy
 
In the future, we intend to expand our services to offer players the ability to participate in video game tournaments for cash prizes. We also intend to grow our existing business through the expansion into additional international markets. Lastly, we plan to increase our marketing efforts and upgrade sales and marketing capabilities which should result in further growth.
Future Products and Services:
 
Online Esports Tournament Play
 
We intend to offer players from around the world, including the United States (except in 13 states in the US and other jurisdictions outside the US which currently prohibit playing games of skill for cash prizes), the ability to enter and participate in online video game tournaments and win cash prizes. Cash-based tournaments involving games of skill are not considered gambling in most U.S. states because the generally accepted definition of gambling involves three specific things: (1) the award of a prize, (2) paid-in consideration (meaning entrants pay to compete) and (3) an outcome determined on the basis of chance. As a result, games of skill are not generally subject to the same laws and regulations as our esports event wagering service. We expect participants in our tournaments being able to enter and play against each other with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We anticipate collecting a tournament entry fee for our tournaments, as well as a percentage of total winnings that are paid to users (typically 10% of the entry fees) and thus none of our money will be at risk or otherwise dependent on the outcome. We intend to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in small groups to major tournaments.
 
We intend to develop, license or acquire from a third party an online skill games tournament play platform. Users will be able to enter and participate in tournaments using their PC, game console or mobile device. Players will play against each other in either ring games (i.e., games for cash on a hand-by-hand basis) or in tournaments (i.e., players play against each other for prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors) or variations thereof. We expect to launch online versions of tournament play, initially utilizing simple video games and later more complex video games, under the VIE brand beginning in the second half of 2019.
 
Live Esports Tournament Play
 
It is our intention to launch live esport tournament play in the fourth quarter of 2019. This platform would be a secured third party platform for online gamers to set up head-to-head tournaments in one on one or larger groups. Once a tournament has been accepted by two or more members/players, money from player accounts is automatically deposited into a secure escrow account. After the online game has been played, the results have been reported and verified by all players, the winner’s account will automatically be credited. The platform will be set up so players can play in head-to-head matches online only for games of skill, not chance. These games include Madden, FIFA, NBA 2K, Call of Duty, Apex Legends and more. We expect to have a list of available games on our homepage. We expect to continuously add games based on feedback from players. Initially it is our intention to support the following systems: Xbox1, PS4, PC, Xbox 360, PS3, WII & WII U.
International Market Expansion
 
We have applied for an online gambling license in Malta, established a brick and mortar office there and intend to commence online gambling operations in that jurisdiction in 2019. If we are successful in obtaining this license, we expect that residents of a number of European Union countries being able to place bets on our website. In order to better service the Asian market, we intend to apply for an online gambling license in an Asian jurisdiction and commence online gambling operations in such jurisdiction within the next 12 months. In the future, we may consider obtaining additional country specific gaming licenses should we determine there is sufficient local demand for our services in these markets.
 
In order to effectively penetrate international markets, we intend to translate our website into several additional languages and offer customer service and technical support in the local language of key markets.

Our Online Wagering Platforms
 
According to Zion Market Research’s, Online Gambling & Betting Market by Game Form (Poker, Casino, Sports Betting, Bingo, Lottery, Horse Racing Betting, and Others) and by Component (Hardware, Software, and Service): Global Industry Perspective, Comprehensive Analysis and Forecast, 2017 – 2024, the online gambling market represents one of the fastest growing segments of the gambling industry. Zion Market estimates the current size of the global online gambling market is in excess of US$45.8 billion and is projected to reach US$94.4 billion by 2024.
 
We are currently focused solely on offering online wagering on the widest range of esports events broadcast from around the world. We do not offer online users traditional casino style games such as poker, craps or slots, nor do we offer online wagering on traditional sporting events such as football or soccer.
 
All persons 18 years and older can presently place bets on our online gambling website at www.vie.gg except for residents of the following countries:
 

● | United States
--+--------------


● | European Union member countries
--+--------------------------------


● | Turkey
--+-------


● | Singapore
--+----------


● | Colombia
--+---------

 
We have applied for an online gambling license from the country of Malta in order to allow residents of certain European Union member countries to place bets on our website. If granted, residents of a number of European Union countries would be able to place bets on our website.
 
Once on our website, a player can place a bet on a team participating in any number of tournaments which are scheduled to be held in the upcoming weeks. This takes place on our betting exchange. A player can either start the bet, using whatever odds are chosen by the player, or accept a bet started by another player. Each bet pertains to a particular game in the tournament. Once the game is over, the winning proceeds, net of our service fee, are electronically transferred to the winning player’s account. For our services, we keep 5.0% to 10.0% of the amount paid to the winning player. We have generated approximately a few hundred thousand dollars of revenue to date, but this amount has not yet been audited by our audit firm.
 
We also maintain and “how to play” section on the website which provides players with instructional videos walking them through the betting exchange platform as well as other pieces of information that may be beneficial to an unexperienced player or a new user of our website or exchange platform.
 
Additionally, we maintain a “frequently asked questions” section which provides our customers with the ability to easily navigate general questions relating to the website, personal account information, payment processing, betting rules and procedures as well as tips.
 
We have agreements with the following third party companies that provide us with certain services that enable our website to function efficiently:
 
MoneyMatrix. MoneyMatrix provides us with the software we use to receive payments from players. Using MoneyMatrix, a player can select from over 150 payment options (i.e. Skrill, Astropay) to deposit funds with us for use in placing bets.
 
Partner Matrix Partner Matrix provides us with the software we use to track players placing a bet through an Affiliate’s link to our website.
 
SportRadar. SportRadar provides our online gaming website with information as to upcoming tournaments, such as the teams participating in those tournaments, the dates and times of specific tournament games and the winners of tournament games.
 
Money Matrix, Partner Matrix and SportRadar all are paid monthly for their services to the Company.

Swiss Interactive. Our betting platform and source code is licensed from Swiss Interactive, a company controlled by Yan Rozum, our previous Chief Technology Officer and a former member of the board of directors. Additionally, Swiss Interactive provides software development and network administration services. We pay Swiss Interactive a percentage on gaming revenues (capped at $300,000 annually) for this license depending on the volume of transactions. Additionally, we paid Swiss Interactive a monthly service fee of $24,500.
Marketing and Sales Initiatives
 
The Company has sponsorship marketing agreements in place for their website as well a similar agreement with HLTV.org (HLTV) to drive traffic to its website. HLTV is the leading Counter-Strike coverage site in the world with on-site coverage of all major tournaments, they feature, stats, demos, news, results, standings, videos, photos, and more. We pay them it is $6,500 per month for marketing services and betting lists which is the list of events to wager on. In addition, the Company also has an agreement in place with an analytics based company to better identify and source better quality campaigns and selective advertising locations.
 
We expect to expand into new geographic territories, assuming we obtain licenses to operate in those territories. The need for hands-on implementation in these territories and support may also require investment in additional physical offices and other overhead. We believe our approach is conservative in these respects.
 
We may accelerate expansion if we find complementary businesses that we are able to acquire in other territories. Our marketing efforts to expand into new territories have included attendance at esports events in addition to personal contact with other market participants.
 
Esports games are played by professional teams, amateur teams, and individuals. Professional esports teams typically have their own social media presence, with some of the top professional teams having millions of fans who visit the team’s website on a regular basis. A website of a professional esports team usually contains specific information about the team and lists upcoming tournaments or events in which the team will be participating. As part of our efforts to market our online gaming services, we attempt to enter into affiliate marketing agreements with professional esport teams.
 
As a marketing affiliate, the esports team will provide their fans with a link to our online gaming website, where the fan, if located in a country which allows the fan to place a bet using our gaming platform, can bet on teams playing in esports tournaments. For a player placing a bet through the team’s link to our website (and provided the player won the bet), we pay the Affiliate a percentage of the amount we collect from the winning bet. As of April 29, 2019, we had more than 170 esports teams agreeing to act as our marketing affiliates.
 
We plan to increase our marketing efforts and awareness of our website and future offerings by:
 

● | continuing to grow our efforts with our affiliate marketing program with professional esports teams;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advertising and sponsoring major professional esports events held in stadiums around the world that are broadcast online to a global audience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | utilizing celebrities and social media influencers who have an interest in video games and esports to generate new customers. We intend to increase our efforts in attracting esports players and other celebrities who have an interest in video games and esports to enter into affiliate marketing agreements with the Company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | using a multimedia approach focused on acquiring and retaining customers. We intend to utilize multiple electronic social media platforms to promote the Company’s wagering business including, but not limited to, Facebook Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube, Twitch, Whatsapp, QQ, WeChat, email and SMS messages and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | using online advertisements, paid search optimization and various social media campaigns to increase our online presence and drive traffic to our website. We intend to increase our investments in online advertisements, primarily through the purchase of banner advertisements on esports and esports gambling related websites. We also intend to continue to invest in optimizing the Company’s website so it will attain a high ranking under key search words or phrases, such as “esports gambling.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we plan to spend approximately $400,000 on marketing.

Competition
 
The online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive. With relatively low barriers to entry, new competitors are entering the esports wagering and video game tournament segments. In both of these segments, there currently exist several major competitors. Because many of these competitors focus on delivering one product, as opposed to a full suite of esports and video gambling products and services that we intend to offer, the competitors may offer an equivalent or superior product to that of the Company. We expect the number of companies offering products and services in each market segment to increase. Most of our current competitors, including Unikrn, bet365, William Hill, Betway, and Pinnacle Sports, have far greater resources than we have.
 
We believe the following differentiates us from our competitors:
 

● | Peer-to-Peer Wagering Model:
--+-----------------------------

 
We believe we are the first and only esports-focused online gambling company to offer bet exchange style wagering and pool betting on professional esports events. Our unique peer-to-peer wagering and gaming model allows the users to wager against other users, with no risk on the particular outcome of an event to the Company and a player always wins. The Company’s real-money betting exchange style wagering and pool betting enables us to facilitate wagering on a wide range of professional esports events broadcast online. We believe that our PvP bet exchange platform allows us to offer players the best odds when wagering on esports events.
 

● | Esports Focused:
--+-----------------

 
We are focused solely on esports gambling and 18+ gaming. We will not offer users traditional casino style games like poker, craps or slots nor do we anticipate offering wagering on traditional sporting events like football or soccer. We are focused solely on delivering the widest selection of content and offering the widest range of esports events all for real-money wagering.
 
Regulations Affecting our Business
 
The offering and operation of online real-money gambling platforms and related software and solutions is subject to extensive regulation and approval by various federal, state, provincial, tribal and foreign agencies (collectively, “gaming authorities”). Gambling laws require us to obtain licenses or findings of suitability from gaming authorities for Esports Entertainment, including each of our subsidiaries engaged in these activities, and certain of our directors, officers, employees and in some instances, significant shareholders (typically beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s outstanding equity). The criteria used by gambling authorities to make determinations as to qualification and suitability of an applicant varies among jurisdictions, but generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough and sometimes lengthy investigation. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be found suitable. Gambling authorities generally look to the following criteria when determining to grant a license or finding of suitability, including (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, (ii) the quality and security of the applicant’s online real-money platform and gaming equipment and related software, as applicable, and (iii) the past history of the applicant. Gambling authorities may, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, and (ii) fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit gaming in all or certain forms and we will not market our gambling services in these jurisdictions. If any director, officer or employee of ours fails to qualify for a license or is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit the required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required to, sever our relationship with such person, which may include terminating the employment of any such person. Gambling authorities have the right to investigate any individual or entity having a material relationship with us, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable or should be licensed to do business as a business associate of ours. In addition, certain gambling authorities monitor the activities of the entities they regulate both in their respective jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions to ensure that these entities are in compliance with local standards on a worldwide basis.

On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 law that barred state-authorized sports gambling with some exceptions and made Nevada the only state where a person could wager on the results of a single game. Since the Supreme Court’s decision, sports gambling has commenced in several states and several more states have enabling legislation pending. We believe that the Supreme Court’s decision will allow our platform to be used in the United States in the future. We plan to explore expansion of our esports online wagering platform into the US market-place at the appropriate time.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have not filed to register any patents, trade names or trademarks in any jurisdictions, but we do intend to file applications to register patents, tradenames or trademarks in the near future.
 
We are currently party to an exclusive software licensing agreement for our bet exchange software platform (the “Licensed Software”) with Swiss Interactive Software GmbH (“Swiss Interactive”), a company controlled by Yan Rozum, our previous Chief Technology Officer and a former member of the board of directors. See “Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths — Licensed Technology/IP” above.
 
Recent Developments
 
On July 17, 2019, the Company and the investors (the “November 2018 Investors”) in its November 2018 private placement offering (the “November 2018 Offering”) of certain Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (each a “November 2018 Note,” collectively, the “November 2018 Notes”) and warrants (the “November 2018 Warrants”) to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock entered into Waiver Agreements (the “Waiver Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Waiver Agreement, the November 2018 Investors waived the exercise of remedies (the “Waiver”) with regard to certain breaches of agreements between the Company and the November 2018 Investors, including the November 2018 Notes, November 2018 Warrants, and Securities Purchase Agreements (the “November 2018 Purchase Agreements”).
 
In consideration for the November 2018 Investors entrance into the Waiver Agreements, the Company will (i) increase the principal amount of each November 2018 Note issued in the November 2018 Offering by 30%, in the form of an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “Amended and Restated Note”). Additionally, for its role as lead investor and facilitator of the November 2018 Offering and negotiating the terms of the Waiver Agreement, the Company issued to Cavalry Fund I LP warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable on or after October 1, 2019 for a term of three (3) years from such date at an exercise price of $0.75 per share (the “Cavalry Warrant”).
 
On August 14, 2019, the Company consummated the initial closing (“Initial Closing”) of a private placement offering (the “Offering”) whereby the Company entered into those certain securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreements”) with four (4) accredited investors (the “Investors”).

The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum and are initially convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.60 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”). The Notes contain a mandatory conversion mechanism whereby unpaid principal and accrued interest on the Notes, upon the closing of a Qualified Offering (as defined therein) converts into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the lower of (i) the Conversion Price and (ii) 80% of the offering price in the Qualified Offering. The Notes contain customary events of default (each an “Event of Default”) and mature on August 14, 2020. If an Event of Default occurs, the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing with respect to the Notes will become, at the Note holder’s election, immediately due and payable in cash at the “Mandatory Default Amount”. The Mandatory Default Amount means the sum of 130% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, including default interest of 18% per year, and all other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of the Notes.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, each Investor was entitled to 100% Warrant coverage, such that such Investor received the same number of Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock as is the number of shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of its Note as of the date of issuance. The Warrants are exercisable at a price of $0.75 per share, subject to adjustment from the date of issuance through August 14, 2022.

The Agent Warrants may be exercised on a “cashless” basis and expire in August 14, 2024.
