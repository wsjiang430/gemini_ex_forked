Recent Developments
 
On December 29, 2017, the Company signed a master service agreement with Ryde, a company in which there is a common director. The agreement was amended on March 15, 2018, pursuant to which the Company changed the scope of services to provide Ryde with the services in connection with Ryde’s development of an image rights management and protection platform (the “Platform”) using blockchain technology, including (i) the business development and technical services, (ii) the business launch services and (iii) the post-business launch support services. The business services agreement with Ryde provides that the fees for the services provided in connection with the development and launch of the Platform (the business development and technical services and business launch services) were deemed earned on the date of execution of the business services agreement. The Company has waived Ryde’s requirement to pay the $250,000 fixed fee in connection with the business development and technical services as a concession. The Company has recognized the business development and technical service fee of $500,000 during the year end December 31, 2017, paid in January 2018 by Ryde upon the completion of its first round of pre-ICO fundraising. Also, as a condition for entering into the loan agreement, Ryde entered into the amendment no. 2, dated as of July 9, 2018, to the business service agreement dated December 29, 2017 as amended as of March 15, 2018, with our company. Pursuant to the amendment no. 2, the Company and Ryde agreed that each party will be responsible for its respective expenses and agreed not to charge any out of pocket expenses to the other party unless expressly approved by the other party in advance in writing.

In consideration for the 2018-19 Services, Ryde agreed to pay a fixed fee of $1,100,000, which is deemed earned as of October 1, 2018, under the agreement, but is not due and payable until Ryde closes on the sale of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (“SAFTs”), equity, or token financings, joint venture financings, or any of its affiliates, in a minimum aggregate amount of $12,000,000, including closings occurring prior to October 1, 2018. For financial reporting purposes, the work fee and additional fee are deemed earned on the date of the financing for a minimum aggregate amount of $12,000,000. In consideration for the 2020 Monthly Services fees, Ryde agreed to pay a monthly fee of $35,000 at the beginning of each month commencing January 1, 2020. All fees and other amounts paid to the Company with respect to the Company’s services provided prior to the amendment no. 3 have been earned in connection with the prior services and will not be credited against any of the above fees or other amounts due under the amendment no. 3.
 
In addition, the amendment no. 3 provides for additional fees for the 2018-19 Services relating to success of Ryde’s business, including the engagement of an investment banker and certain financing milestones and additional fees and milestone fees relating to the achievements of certain net revenues and creation of a business relationship that increases the value of Ryde. The Company will not provide any services related to any financings to be conducted by Ryde. The Company will also receive 20 million tokens based upon 100 million tokens issued, which number will be increased on a pro rata basis, if at any time, Ryde issues more than 100 million tokens (the “Token Fee”). The Token Fee has been previously earned and will be issued in connection with the first release of any tokens to any party.
 
However, if the business services agreement is terminated before December 31, 2019, (a) the fee for the 2018-19 Services will be immediately due in full (but only if the foregoing $12,000,000 financing is closed either before or after the termination date), (b) any additional fees and milestone fees earned will be immediately paid in full (if the condition precedent/milestones are achieved), (c) the Token Fee will be immediately transferred to the Company, and (d) any future adjustment in the number of tokens issued by Ryde, to over 100,000,000, will result in the immediately issuance to our company of 20% of such additional tokens.
 
The amendment no. 3 provides that the business services agreement will continue until December 31, 2020 unless earlier terminated by either party, provided, however, the term of the 2020 Monthly Services will automatically renew for successive one-year periods after December 31, 2020, which renewal term can be terminated by either party with 30 days advanced written notice. The amendment no. 3 also provides that the Company may terminate the business services agreement upon the provision of 30 days written notice to Ryde. Ryde may terminate the business services agreement after December 31, 2019, upon the provision of 30 days written notice to the Company. If the Company or Ryde provides such notice, the Company or Ryde, as applicable, may immediately terminate the business services agreement and the Company will be entitled to no further compensation except for any fees earned prior to the date of the termination and other fees discussed above, which are due regardless of such early termination.
 
The Company has agreed that Ryde will not be responsible for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the performance of the services. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay, and otherwise be financially responsible for (including through the reimbursement of disbursements made by Ryde and its affiliates), (i) all legal costs and expenses incurred by Ryde, the Company and any of their affiliates in connection with the Ryde Offering; (ii) all business and travel expenses incurred by Ryde, the Company and any of their affiliates in connection the Ryde Offering; and (iii) all fees and expenses incurred by Ryde in connection with its conversion of cryptocurrencies into US dollars in connection with the Ryde Offering, including bank, exchange and other similar fees and expenses. Ryde will have the right to deduct any such amounts from the fees otherwise payable by it to the Company and apply such deducted amounts to the payments to the Company.
 
The Company’s chairman and one of its directors, Cameron Chell, is a director, officer and an indirect shareholder of Business Instincts Group Inc. which owns 10% of the common stock of Ryde and he is also a director, officer and indirect shareholder of Blockchain Merchant Group, Inc. which owns 2.5% of the common stock of Ryde and the Company owns 7.5% of the common stock of Ryde. Mr. Chell is also a director, chairman, and officer of Ryde. Mr. Elliott is a former officer of Ryde. Our chief financial officer, Swapan Kakumanu, is also the chief financial officer of Ryde.

Upon such termination, ICOx USA will be entitled to no further compensation except for (i) any fees earned and out-of-pocket expenses incurred prior to the termination and (ii) any other amounts or consideration as set forth in any statement of work which are to be paid upon or regardless of such termination.

Description of Business
 
Overview
 
Our business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations. We anticipate that we will enable companies to focus on their core competencies while providing the necessary resources and expertise to execute a strategy that will enable companies to integrate new blockchain plus cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations. Our plan is to be compensated on a fee-for-services model, technology licensing model and a reoccurring transaction revenue model. We may accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services to the extent permitted under applicable law.
Blockchain Technology
 
Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Functionally, a blockchain can serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority.
 
Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system and decentralization can be achieved with a blockchain. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records and other record management activities, such as identity management, documenting provenance, digital asset registration and transaction processing.
 
Initial Coin Offerings and Cryptocurrency
 
A cryptocurrency is a digital asset – often referred to as a coin or token – that is used as a medium of exchange using cryptography and decentralized control via a blockchain to secure the transaction and to control the creation of additional units of the currency.
 
We may receive fees from initial coin offering proceeds, in a combination of cash and tokens, coins or equity, to the extent permitted under applicable law. For any cryptocurrencies received, we intend to hold cryptocurrencies on our balance sheet and to sell them from time to time via regulated trading exchanges, to the extent permitted under applicable law. We are not involved in the issuance of cryptocurrencies or mining or other related technical cryptocurrency production.

CoinLaunch’s integrated cryptocurrency funding system enables backers to fund various campaigns using a built-in crypto-payment gateway. It also includes an affiliate and referral system that tracks and manages all aspects of the promotion of ICO campaigns. The platform facilitates the payment of referrals using a CoinLaunch Token, which then can be used to purchase ICOs offered on the platform or redeemed for other cryptocurrencies. The platform includes an integrated compliance system that allows for any vetted ICOs to comply with various local regulations, including know-your-client and anti-money laundering regulations.
 

● | CoinList
--+---------

 
CoinList uses screens and selects blockchain companies. In August 2017, CoinList facilitated the token sale for blockchain-based data storage network Filecoin. CoinList also offers as part of its service a white-labeled compliance infrastructure stack. Purpose-built for token sales, ComplyAPI provides companies with SEC Rule 506 investor accreditation and know-your-client and anti-money laundering compliance due diligence through a simple integration and API.

In addition to the development of internal projects and consulting work, ConsenSys is engaged in the identification, development and acquisition of talent and projects on an ongoing basis.
 

● | SaftLaunch
--+-----------

 
SaftLaunch.com offers a service for companies seeking to issue an ICO or raise funds through a SAFT agreement, including a proprietary know-your-client and anti-money laundering compliance solution that positions it to co-invest into early stage projects in the pre-ICO phase.
 

● | Science

TokenMarket is a full service ICO provider. Its service offerings include:
 

○ | ICO Launchpad, a service for organizing a “crowdsale” with a high quality blockchain industry network, expertise and tools with tradeable digital tokens;

In order to launch a legally compliant token, Polymath platform brings together issuers, legal delegates, smart contract developers, know-your-client verification, and a decentralized exchange. All transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token.
 

● | IBM
--+----

 
With thousands of technical experts, IBM is moving quickly into enterprise blockchain and claims the leading blockchain for business platform. This is primarily B2B focused work.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on product development, marketing and distribution. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire larger market share and develop and offer more competitive products and services. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to develop our business plan. In the face of competition, we may not be successful in sufficient market share to make our business profitable.
 
Intellectual Property and Technology
 
We do not currently own any intellectual property. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, patents, trademark and copyright laws to protect any intellectual property that we create, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights may be protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.
 
We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. In addition, while we are not aware that our services or proprietary rights infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, we may receive notices from third parties asserting that we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights. Any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service stoppages or lead us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements rather than disputing the merits of such claims. An adverse outcome in litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, or require us to cease operating our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
As we have just begun our new business, we have devoted no substantial efforts to research and development within the last two fiscal years.

Government Regulation
 
Current and future legislation and rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins or other cryptocurrency is viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoins and other cryptocurrency may not be excluded from the definition of “security” by regulatory rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions, unless an exemption is available, including transacting in bitcoin or cryptocurrency amongst owners, and require registration of trading platforms as “exchanges” such as Coinsquare. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies under the law. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our own account and harm investors.
 
We intend to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or know your customer rules relating to tokens imposed by the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.
 
Investment Company Act of 1940 Considerations
 
We intend to conduct our operations so that we do not fall within, or are excluded from the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a company is deemed to be an “investment company” if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We believe that we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 because we will not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, our new business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations.
 
Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a company is deemed to be an “investment company” if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the “40% test.” We intend to monitor our holdings and conduct operations so that on an unconsolidated basis we will comply with the 40% test. Nevertheless, because we may accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services, to the extent permitted under applicable law, we may acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. In that case, we intend to rely on a safe harbor exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940 for so-called “transient investment companies.”
 
Consistent with the “transient investment company” safe harbor, we will have to reduce our holdings of “investment securities to not more than 40% of our total assets as soon as is reasonably possible and in any event within one year from the earlier of (i) the date on which we own securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the value of our company’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (ii) the date on which we own or propose to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. This reduction could be attempted in a number of ways, including the disposition of securities and the acquisition of other assets that would not constitute investment securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we are required to sell securities, we may sell them sooner than we otherwise would, the sales may be at depressed prices, and we may never realize anticipated benefits from, or may incur losses on, those investments. We may not be able to sell some investments due to contractual or legal restrictions or the inability to locate a suitable buyer. We may also incur tax liabilities when we sell our assets. If we decide to try to acquire additional assets that would not constitute investment securities, we may not be able to identify and acquire suitable assets. If these steps do not achieve a sufficient reduction in our holdings of investment securities within the prescribed period, we will be forced to liquidate some of our securities holdings and invest the proceeds in U.S. government securities and cash items, with a potential loss.
 
Because we can rely on the “transient investment company” safe harbor only once during any three-year period, we may not accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services during the period that this safe harbor is not available.

If we become obligated to register our company as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940 imposing, among other things:
 

● | limitations on capital structure; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | restrictions on specified investments; 
● | prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and 
● | compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations. 

 
If we were required to register our company as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, all of which would have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Employees
 
As at March 26, 2019, we have three executive officers, Bruce Elliott, who is our president, Michael Blum, who is our chief operating officer, secretary, and treasurer, and Swapan Kakumanu, who is our chief financial officer, and no employees. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We also employ consultants on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of product design and development and other business functions including marketing and accounting. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus.
