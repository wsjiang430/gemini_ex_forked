OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global (excluding Central & Eastern Europe plus other territories) development and commercialization of cytisinicline for smoking cessation. The United States Adopted Names, or USAN, Council adopted cytisinicline as the non-proprietary, or generic, name for the substance also known as cytisine during the third quarter of 2018.  Our focus is to address the global smoking health epidemic, which is a leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for approximately seven million deaths annually worldwide. 
 Cytisinicline is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by Sopharma AD for over 20 years under the brand name Tabex™. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisinicline to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014, respectively.  
 Cytisinicline is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisinicline is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic binding to nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking through antagonistic properties. The currently-marketed 1.5 mg cytisinicline dosing schedule reflects that of an anti-addiction medication, with downward dose titration over a period of 25 days. 
 Investigational New Drug, or IND-enabling, non-clinical toxicology studies completed to date have been sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, division of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, in addition to the National Cancer Institute. In June 2017, we filed our IND application for cytisinicline with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which included NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies.
 In August 2017, we initiated a study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisinicline in normal healthy volunteers. We completed the food effect study and announced the results in November of 2017 demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisinicline in fed and fasted subjects.
 In October 2017, we initiated a study assessing the repeat-dose Pharmacokinetics, or PK, and Pharmacodynamics, or PD, effects of 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg cytisinicline in 36 healthy volunteer smokers when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment. Of the 36 subjects, 24 were to be 18-65 years and 12 were to be greater than 65 years of age. Preliminary results on the 24 smokers (18-65 years) were announced in February 2018 and final results were presented at the annual Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, or SRNT, meeting in February 2019. The study randomized a total of 26 subjects. This included only 2 of the intended 12 subjects greater than age 65, due to difficulty enrolling within this age group.  All 26 subjects completed the study. Predictable increases in plasma cytisinicline concentrations were observed with increasing unit dosing from 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date. Overall, subjects had an 80% reduction in cigarettes smoked, 82% reduction in expired carbon monoxide, and 46% of the subjects achieving biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Subjects who received 3.0 mg cytisinicline over the 25 days had a trend for higher smoking abstinence compared to subjects who received 1.5 mg cytisinicline. The adverse events observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event. No severe or serious adverse events were observed in the study. 
 In December 2017, we initiated a series of drug metabolism, drug-to-drug interaction, and transporter studies of cytisinicline and results from these studies were announced in June 2018. These studies demonstrated that cytisinicline has no clinically significant interaction with any of the hepatic enzymes commonly responsible for drug metabolism nor clinically significant interaction with drug transporters. This suggests that cytisinicline may be administered with other medications without the need to modify the dose of any co-administered medications. We will continue to evaluate whether additional drug-to-drug interactions studies will be required prior to any future New Drug Application, or NDA, filing.

We have met with the FDA and with other national regulatory authorities in Europe to identify the steps required for the approval of cytisinicline. We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in May 2018 to review and receive guidance on our Phase 3 clinical program and overall development plans for cytisinicline to support an NDA. This review included submitted results from non-clinical studies, standard drug-to-drug interaction and reproductive/teratogenicity studies. Detailed plans for chronic toxicology, carcinogenicity studies, and additional human studies regarding renal impairment, QT interval prolongation, longer term exposure and adequate demonstration of safety and efficacy from our planned randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials were also discussed.
 A new cytisinicline tablet with improved shelf life has been formulated and recently launched commercially by Sopharma in their territories. In May 2018, we initiated a study to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisinicline in volunteer smokers using this new formulation and data results were announced in September 2018. The study demonstrated similar bioavailability of cytisinicline in fed and fasted subjects. Cytisinicline was extensively absorbed after oral administration with maximum cytisinicline concentration levels observed in the blood within less than two hours with or without food. Total excretion levels of cytisinicline also remained equivalent in both the fed and fasted states, and the 3.0 mg dose of this new formulation of cytisinicline was well tolerated.
 In October 2018, we initiated the ORCA-1 trial, a Phase 2b optimization study in approximately 250 smokers in the United States, or U.S. ORCA-1 is the first in our ORCA (Ongoing Research of Cytisinicline for Addiction) Program that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cytisinicline for smoking cessation and potentially other indications. This Phase 2b trial will evaluate both the 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg doses of cytisinicline on a declining titration schedule as well as three times daily dosing, both over 25 days. The trial is randomized and blinded to compare the effectiveness of the cytisinicline doses and schedules to respective placebo groups. All subjects are treated for 25 days and followed up for a further four weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is reduction in the number of cigarettes consumed during treatment with secondary analyses to be conducted on smoking cessation rates, safety, and compliance. ORCA-1 is being conducted at eight centers across the U.S. In February 2019, we announced that the trial had completed enrollment with 254 smokers and top line results are expected in mid-2019.
 In December 2018, we announced that FDA was in agreement with our Initial Pediatric Study Plan, specifically, providing a full waiver for evaluating cytisinicline in a pediatric population. The reasons for the full waiver were based on the low numbers of children smoking under the age of 12 and the logistical difficulties of recruiting treatment-seeking smokers in the adolescent age group. The agreed Pediatric Study Plan is expected to be included as part of our future application for marketing approval of cytisinicline.
 In March 2019, we initiated a trial to assess the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for a single administered oral dose of cytisinicline. This study will be performed in smokers who will receive one single dose of cytisinicline. The dosage of cytisinicline will be increased in separate groups of subjects per dose level until stopping criteria (based on the occurrence of dose-limiting adverse events) are reached. This study is a requirement for our future application for marketing approval of cytisinicline.
 Our management team has significant experience in growing emerging companies focused on the development of under-utilized pharmaceutical compounds to meet unmet medical needs. We intend to use this experience to develop and ultimately commercialize cytisinicline either directly or via strategic collaborations.

OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE - CYTISINICLINE
 Overview of Cytisinicline
 Our product candidate, cytisinicline, is a naturally occurring plant-based alkyloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisinicline is believed to aid in smoking cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking. 
 Cytisinicline is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by our partner Sopharma for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisinicline to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014. TabexTM is currently marketed in a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in other geographic regions, as an Over-the-Counter drug, or OTC.
Cytisinicline Mechanism of Action
 Cytisinicline is a partial agonist that binds with high affinity to the alpha-4 beta-2, or a4b2, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Through dual-acting partial agonist/partial antagonist activity, cytisinicline is believed to help reduce nicotine cravings, withdrawal symptoms and reward and satisfaction associated with smoking. The a4b2 nicotinic receptor is a well-understood target in addiction. When nicotine binds to this receptor, it causes dopamine to be released in the mid brain, reinforcing the dopamine reward system. This receptor has been implicated in the development and maintenance of nicotine dependence. Cytisinicline is believed to act as a partial agonist at the  a4b2 nicotinic receptor, preventing nicotine from binding and releasing dopamine. 
 Cytisinicline Opportunity
 
We have an exclusive license and supply agreement with Sopharma for the development and commercialization of cytisinicline outside of Sopharma’s territory, which consists of certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam. We intend to develop and commercialize cytisinicline in the U.S. and intend thereafter to target other markets outside of Sopharma’s territory, such as Western Europe, Japan, Australasia, Southeast Asia and Latin and South America.
 We are developing cytisinicline as an aid to smoking cessation and nicotine dependence to address the limitations of both prescription drugs and OTC products. We believe that a substantial market exists in the U.S., European Union, or EU, and the rest of the world for a safe and effective smoking cessation treatment. Increasingly constrained healthcare budgets have focused government attention on drug pricing, which we believe cytisinicline can address by serving as a cost-effective alternative to existing treatments, with the potential for better efficacy than nicotine replacement therapies, or NRTs, and a potentially superior side effect profile than existing prescription smoking cessation products. Our goal is to obtain approval from the FDA and from other regulatory agencies for the sale and distribution of cytisinicline in the U.S. and subsequently to other countries outside of Sopharma’s territory.
 IND-enabling, non-clinical toxicology studies completed to date have been sponsored by the NCCIH, division of the NIH, in addition to the National Cancer Institute. In June 2017, we filed our IND application for cytisinicline with the FDA which included NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies.

Cytisinicline Clinical Trials
 Cytisinicline has been previously tested in two large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP requirements of the FDA, in more than 2,000 participants. The objective by independent groups was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cytisinicline according to current clinical development standards.
 TASC Trial
 The Tabex Smoking Cessation, or TASC, trial, was sponsored by the United Kingdom, or U.K., Centre for Tobacco Control Studies and evaluated cytisinicline versus placebo in 740 primarily moderate-to-heavy smokers treated for 25 days in a single center in 
 6


Warsaw, Poland. The TASC trial was designed as a Real World Evidence trial of cytisinicline that included minimal behavioral support. The primary outcome measure was sustained, biochemically verified smoking abstinence for 12 months after the end of treatment. The TASC trial was conceived by Professor Robert West (Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London) and was funded by a grant from the National Prevention Research Initiative, including contributions from Cancer Research U.K., the U.K. Medical Research Council, U.K. Department of Health and others. We, through our partner Sopharma, provided the study drug used in this trial.
 The results of the TASC trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011. The rate of sustained 12-month abstinence was 8.4% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 2.4% in the placebo group (p=0.001). These results showed that cytisinicline was 3.4 times more likely than a placebo to help participants stop smoking and remain non-smokers for one year. The rate of sustained 6-month abstinence was 10.0% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 3.5% in the placebo group (p<0.001). Cytisinicline was well tolerated with a slight but significant increase in combined gastrointestinal adverse events (upper abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia and dry mouth; cytisinicline 51/370 (13.8%) and placebo 30/370 (8.1%). The safety profile of cytisinicline was similar to that of a placebo with no other significant differences in the rate of side effects in the two trial arms. 
 A summary of adverse events reported in 10 or more subjects in the TASC trial is included in the table below.

(1) | The incidence of events was analyzed according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities System Organ Class, or SOC, categorization and preferred terms. Participants who reported more than one event in a system category were counted only once for the category. SOC categories for other events (those reported by fewer than 10 participants) were as follows: general (five events within cytisinicline and five with placebo), cardiac (four with cytisinicline and two with placebo), musculoskeletal and connective tissue (three with cytisinicline and three with placebo), infections (one with placebo), immune system (one with placebo) and metabolism and nutrition (one with placebo).

 CASCAID Trial
 The second Phase 3 trial, the Cytisine As a Smoking Cessation Aid, or CASCAID, non-inferiority trial, was an open-label trial that randomized 1,310 adult daily heavy smokers. Patients were randomized to receive either cytisinicline for 25 days or NRT for 8 weeks. Both treatment groups were offered low intensity telephone behavioral support during trial treatment. The primary outcome measure was continuous self-reported abstinence from smoking one month after quit date. The CASCAID trial was conducted by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. We, through our partner Sopharma, provided the cytisinicline in form of commercial Tabex™ used in this trial.
 The results of the CASCAID trial, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2014, showed that cytisinicline was superior to NRT for smoking cessation and, specifically, that cytisinicline was 1.43 times more likely than nicotine gums or patches to help participants stop smoking and remain non-smokers for six months. The rate of continuous one-month abstinence was 40% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 31% in the NRT arm (p<0.001). A secondary outcome included the rate of continuous six-month abstinence which was 22% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 15% in the NRT arm (p=0.002). Cytisinicline was generally well tolerated, although self-reported adverse events were slightly higher in the cytisinicline arm compared with the NRT arm. The most frequent adverse events for cytisinicline were nausea and vomiting (30/665 (4.6%)) and sleep disorders 
 7


(28/665 (4.2%)). Reports of these same adverse events in the NRT arm were as follows: nausea and vomiting (2/655 (0.3%)) and sleep disorders (2/655 (0.3%)).

Safety Reporting 
 As cytisinicline has been marketed in Central and Eastern Europe for over 20 years, substantial safety reporting exists for cytisinicline including over 15 million cases. The most recent periodic safety update report submitted to the European authorities by Sopharma in 2018 did not contain new safety signals with cytisinicline.
OVERVIEW OF MARKET AND TREATMENT 
 Overview of the Tobacco Epidemic
 The U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the World Health Organization, or WHO, estimate that approximately 1.1 billion people globally are smokers and that 7 million people die annually from diseases related to tobacco use including 890,000 from passive smoke. This figure is projected to grow to 8 million by 2030. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, estimate that in 2017 approximately 14% of all U.S. adults (34.3 million people) were cigarette smokers.  
 8


Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the U.S., including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure. This is about one in five deaths annually, or 1,300 deaths every day. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is a direct cause of approximately 80% of lung cancer deaths and is linked to 30% of all cancer deaths. Smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death worldwide and in the U.S.
 CDC estimates that the annual cost of smoking related illnesses in the U.S. is more than $300 billion annually in direct medical care and lost productivity. Over 16 million people in the U.S. are living with a disease caused by smoking. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also increases risk for tuberculosis, certain eye diseases and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis.
 Tobacco smoking is highly addictive and research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine or alcohol.  The CDC estimates that more people are addicted to nicotine than any other drug and report that nearly 70% of smokers desire to quit and 55% make a quit attempt each year. Despite the high number of attempts, only about 7% of people are successful in their quit attempt each year. Additionally, up to 60% of people who quit smoking relapse in the first year due to the addictive nature of nicotine. 
 
One increasingly popular method as an alternative to smoking is the use of e-cigarettes, or vaping, which deliver liquid nicotine into a mist or vapor which is inhaled.  This method of consumption avoids the chemicals that are associated with cigarette smoke but may have other associated health and safety issues. The emerging use of e-cigarettes is contributing to growing population of people who are addicted to nicotine. 
 
The FDA considers e-cigarette use as an epidemic, particularly in youth. From 2017 to 2018, vaping increased 78 percent among high school students (11.7% to 20.8%) and 48 percent among middle school students (3.3% to 4.9%).
 The Global Smoking Cessation Market
 Coherent Market Insights Report “Smoking Cessation and Nicotine De-addiction Products Market, 2016-2017” estimated that global revenues for smoking cessation and nicotine de-addiction products in 2016 was approximately $12.8 billion including nicotine replacement therapies, or NRT, e-cigarettes and drug therapy. In 2017, in the U.S. alone, sales for NRT and drug therapy were estimated to be $3.8 billion and is expected to grow to $5.7 billion by 2024. 
 Two prescription oral treatments for smoking cessation are currently available in the U.S.: Chantix® (varenicline) marketed by Pfizer and Zyban ® (bupropion) marketed by GlaxoSmithKline (as well as generic manufacturers). Chantix requires a three-month treatment period and Zyban is recommended for between 7 and 12 weeks. Both of these prescription treatments have been proven effective in aiding smoking cessation, however, both are also associated with significant side effects and drop offs from treatment. Chantix’s labeling indicates elevated instances of nausea, abnormal dreams, constipation, flatulence and vomiting may be experienced by Chantix-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, and Zyban’s labeling discloses potential adverse reactions including insomnia, rhinitis, dry mouth, dizziness, nervous disturbance, anxiety, nausea, constipation, arthralgia and seizures. High uptake into the brain combined with activity at “off target” receptors could be responsible for Chantix’s adverse event profile.
 Global sales of Chantix® exceeded $1 billion in 2018. $838 million of Chantix 2018 sales, approximately 77%, were attributable to the U.S. market.
 The vast majority of Over-the-Counter, or OTC, smoking cessation aids are NRTs. NRTs come in many forms, including gums, lozenges and patches, and although they are marketed at a lower price point, they have been shown to be less effective than prescription drugs. For example, a Cochrane Group independent database review of nicotine receptor partial agonists published in 2016 compared varenicline (Chantix) with a number of NRTs and varenicline has been proven to be more effective than the NRTs, as demonstrated in head-to-head studies.
 
LICENSE & SUPPLY AGREEMENTS 
 Sopharma AD 
 In 2009 and 2010, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sopharma License Agreement, and a supply agreement, or the Sopharma Supply Agreement, with Sopharma, AD, or Sopharma. Pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement, we were granted access to all available manufacturing, efficacy and safety data related to cytisinicline, as well as a granted patent in several European countries including Germany, France and Italy related to oral dosage forms of cytisinicline. Additional rights granted under the Sopharma License Agreement include the exclusive use of, and the right to sublicense, the trademark Tabex in all territories—other than certain countries in Central and Eastern 
 9


Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam, where Sopharma or its affiliates and agents already market Tabex—in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of products. Under the Sopharma License Agreement, we agreed to pay a nonrefundable license fee. In addition, we agreed to make certain royalty payments equal to a mid-teens percentage of all net sales of Tabex branded products in our territory during the term of the Sopharma License Agreement, including those sold by a third party pursuant to any sublicense which may be granted by us. We have agreed to cooperate with Sopharma in the defense against any actual or threatened infringement claims with respect to Tabex. Sopharma has the right to terminate the Sopharma License Agreement upon the termination or expiration of the Sopharma Supply Agreement. The Sopharma License Agreement will also terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency and material breach. To date, any amounts paid to Sopharma pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement have been immaterial.
 A cross-license exists between us and Sopharma whereby we grant to Sopharma rights to any patents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights filed by us in Sopharma territories. 
 On May 14, 2015, we and Sopharma entered into an amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement. Among other things, the amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement reduced the royalty payments payable by us to Sopharma from a percentage in the mid-teens to a percentage in the mid-single digits and extended the term of the Sopharma License Agreement until May 26, 2029. 
 On July 28, 2017, we and Sopharma entered into the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement. Pursuant to the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement, for territories as detailed in the licensing agreement, we will exclusively purchase all of our cytisinicline from Sopharma, and Sopharma agrees to exclusively supply all such cytisinicline requested by us, and we extended the term to 2037. In addition, Achieve will have full access to the cytisinicline supply chain and Sopharma will manufacture sufficient cytisinicline to meet a forecast for a specified demand of cytisinicline for the five years commencing shortly after the commencement of the agreement, with the forecast to be updated regularly thereafter. Each of us and Sopharma may terminate the Sopharma Supply Agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach or bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 University of Bristol 
 In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Bristol, or the University of Bristol License Agreement. Under the University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from the University of Bristol to certain patent and technology rights resulting from research activities into cytisinicline and its derivatives for use in smoking cessation, including a number of patent applications related to novel approaches to cytisinicline binding at the nicotinic receptor level. Any patents issued in connection with these applications would be scheduled to expire on February 5, 2036 at the earliest. 
 In consideration of rights granted by the University of Bristol, we agreed to pay amounts of up to $3.2 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the University of Bristol License Agreement. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize product candidates subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement, we are responsible for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. 
 On January 22, 2018, we and the University of Bristol entered into an amendment to the University of Bristol License Agreement. Pursuant to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive rights for all human medicinal uses of cytisinicline across all therapeutic categories from the University of Bristol from research activities into cytisinicline and its derivatives. In consideration of rights granted by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, we agreed to pay an initial amount of $37,500 upon the execution of the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, and additional amounts of up to $1.7 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, in addition to amounts under the original University of Bristol License Agreement of up to $3.2 million in the aggregate, tied to specific financing, development and commercialization milestones. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement or to the original University of Bristol License Agreement, we will be responsible, as provided in the original University of Bristol License Agreement, for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. Up to December 31, 2018, we have paid the University of Bristol $125,000 pursuant to the University of Bristol License Agreement.
 Unless otherwise terminated, the University of Bristol License Agreement will continue until the earlier of July 2036 or the expiration of the last patent claim subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement. We may terminate the University of Bristol License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to the University of Bristol. The University of Bristol License Agreement will terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency or its material breach of the agreement. Under the terms of the University of Bristol License Agreement, we had provided 100 grams of cytisinicline to the University of Bristol as an initial contribution.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 We are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal regulating authority is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of product candidates and research, quality, manufacturing processes, product approval and promotion, advertising and product labeling. In the EU, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national regulatory agencies regulate the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of product candidates, and over-see the procedures for approval of drugs for the EU and European Economic Area countries similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates prices. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA, before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval.
United States
 We intend to focus initially on clinical development of cytisinicline in the U.S. It is anticipated that cytisinicline tablets would receive a minimum five years of data exclusivity under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 Before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an NDA, for a new drug. The steps required before the FDA will approve an NDA generally include non-clinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the trial sponsor; sponsor submission of the NDA application to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured.
 As a condition of product approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical trials, known as Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product. The FDA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market trials and programs. Any modifications to a drug, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental NDA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we generate additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process. We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
 Sales and Marketing. The marketing practices of U.S. pharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical or medical device company from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices, including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The U.S. federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical or medical device companies. These laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative 
 11


guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.
 Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products will depend in part on government regulation. We will likely be required to offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. We will also be required to report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose us to penalties.
 In the U.S., Medicaid currently covers all smoking cessation products including Chantix and Zyban. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Section 2502 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, specifies that tobacco cessation medications will be removed from the list of optional medications and required for inclusion in states’ prescription drug benefit. On May 2, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, provided guidance into insurance coverage policy that health plans would be in compliance if they cover, among other items, screening for tobacco use, individual, group and phone counseling, all FDA approved tobacco cessation medications (both prescription and OTC) when prescribed by a healthcare provider, at least two quit attempts per year, four sessions of counseling and 90 days of treatment, with no cost sharing (co-pay) required.
 Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states are considering a variety of cost-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments.
 Healthcare Reform. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry, such as:

• | increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name and generic prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care;


• | Requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide discounts on brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap; and


• | Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

 The ACA includes provisions designed to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance. Specifically, since 2014, the ACA has required most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to additional individuals. Additionally, policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing restrictions. Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.
 On January 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order to initiate the repeal of the Healthcare Reform Law and we expect that additional state and federal healthcare measures under the Trump administration will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for our product candidates, or additional pricing pressures. Currently, the Healthcare Reform Law provides coverage for smoking cessation-related activities, including two counseling attempts for smoking cessation per year and prescription drugs for smoking cessation, but not OTC treatments. If these provisions are repealed, in whole or in part, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.
 Anti-Corruption. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or 
 12


regulations. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.
 Outside the United States
 We expect to encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we seek to develop and commercialize cytisinicline.
 New Drug Approvals and Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the EEA countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the EU and EEA than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country.
 In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the EU. Key changes include the establishment of a new Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee within the EMA, with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. It also introduces the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive.
 The U.K. is currently a member state of the EU. However, the U.K. has signaled its intention to withdraw from the EU, which is commonly known as BREXIT. Following BREXIT, if it occurs, the U.K. would no longer be a member state within the EU. Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the U.K. is derived from the regulations of the EU, BREXIT could materially change the regulatory framework applicable to the approval of our product candidates and other aspects of our business in the U.K., such as the pricing and importation of prescription products. However, at this time it is not known what new regulatory framework will be in place to govern the review and approval of new medicines in the U.K. Further, the EMA is currently located in the U.K. but is relocating to The Netherlands. It is possible that BREXIT will result in disruption to the EMA’s review process.
 Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the U.S. and Europe.
 CONTRACT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS 
 Our strategy is to outsource certain product development activities and have established contract research agreements for, non-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and some data management services. We choose which business or institution to use for these services based on their expertise, capacity and reputation and the cost of the service. 
 We also provide or have provided quantities of our product candidates to academic research institutions to investigate the mechanism of action and evaluate novel combinations of product candidates with other cancer therapies in various cancer indications. These collaborations expand our research activities for our product candidates with modest contribution from us. 
 MANUFACTURING 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of cytisinicline, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on Sopharma as supplier and contract manufacturer for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for our clinical trials. In addition to our Sopharma relationship, we utilize contract manufacturing organizations for the clinical packaging supplies of cytisinicline. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our clinical manufacturing activities.
 Sopharma sources cytisinicline from the Laburnum anagyroides plant, a shrub or small tree native to, and widely distributed throughout, Bulgaria, south Central Europe and the northwestern Balkan Peninsula. The seed pods are harvested from the shrubs and dried. Sopharma currently has planted approximately 225 acres of Laburnum trees, saplings and seedlings in multiple locations in Central and Eastern Bulgaria and is in the process of planting another 150 acres. Sopharma plans to plant additional trees to manage supply for major markets. Each tree takes approximately four to five years to reach maturity for harvesting and has a productive life expectancy of 20 to 25 years. Seeds are harvested annually, dried and stored for processing into cytisinicline.  Laburnum seeds in their 
 13


natural state are highly toxic and the extraction process removes the toxins to produce highly purified cytisinicline. Sopharma is stockpiling Laburnum seeds to meet the projected demand from us upon commercial launch.
 The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing process utilizes a series of techniques including milling, solvent extraction, filtration and purification. Critical control steps and manufacturing intermediates have been identified and are controlled by internally developed specifications and methods to ensure a consistent and reproducible process. The highly purified cytisinicline is dried, sieved and packed for storage until further processing into drug product. The cytisinicline API manufacturing process has been developed and refined over many years of manufacture by Sopharma, which has significant expertise in manufacturing cytisinicline.
 Sopharma manufactures cytisinicline API in its facilities in Bulgaria, which are near the capital, Sofia. The API processing facility complies with EU cGMP requirements and has been inspected by the Bulgarian Drug Agency. 
 SALES AND MARKETING
 Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives. We in
tend to seek partners in territories where we have no commercial experience and intend to directly market in niche markets where a small cost-effective commercial capability can generate direct revenues.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that certain claims to naturally-occurring substances are not patentable. Cytisinicline is a naturally-occurring product and is therefore not patentable in the U.S.  Furthermore, cytisinicline has been in use in other parts of the world for decades, and is not susceptible to patenting in its current form.
 Our development and commercialization of cytisinicline is protected by our exclusive supply agreement with Sopharma and Sopharma’s proprietary technology, experience and expertise in cytisinicline extraction. In addition, we intend to utilize market exclusivity laws including those under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the U.S. and exclusivity under Directive 2004/27/EC in the EU.
 
Additionally, we are actively building an intellectual property portfolio around our clinical-stage product candidate and research programs. A key component of this portfolio strategy is to seek international patent protection with patent applications in the U.S. and in major market countries that we consider important to the development of our business worldwide. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of two international PCT applications and one national phase of patent applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, S. Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K. and the U.S. This portfolio includes composition of matter and methods of use for novel cytisinicline derivatives.
 
We intend to take one of the above-noted PCT applications into national phase in 2019. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business.  We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. 
 
COMPETITION 
 The development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to smoking cessation and other product candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We are aware that many companies have therapeutics marketed or in development for smoking cessation, including, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Merck & Co., Novartis, Pharmacia Polanica, Invion, Embera Neurotherapeutics, Redwood Scientific Technologies, Inc., 22nd Century Group, Inc., Quit4Good, zpharm, Chrono Therapeutics, NAL Pharmaceuticals, Selecta Biosciences, Aradigm, Adamed, Aflofarm and others. We expect that our competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated, and will continue to 
 14


dedicate, significant resources to aggressively develop and commercialize their products in order to take advantage of the significant market opportunity.
 Prescription Treatments
 Two oral prescription drugs for smoking cessation are currently available in the U.S. – Chantix and Zyban. Both have been proven effective in aiding smoking cessation, however, each is associated with a number of adverse effects.
 We believe that cytisinicline may have similar efficacy to Chantix with potential fewer adverse events and could be more cost-effective to patients. A Cochrane Group independent database review of nicotine receptor partial agonists published in 2016, or the Cochrane Report, compared cytisinicline with Chantix and found no apparent difference in efficacy between cytisinicline and Chantix, in that the database review found that the risk ratio for cytisinicline and Chantix was in the same order of magnitude. In addition, it should be noted that only two studies were used to calculate the risk ratio for cytisinicline versus 27 trials for varenicline, and that evidence for varenicline was considered of high and moderate quality while the evidence for cytisinicline was considered low quality. However, a head-to-head comparative trial of these two treatments has not been performed. Furthermore, a report by the National Institute of Health Research in the U.K. comparing Chantix and cytisinicline concluded that cytisinicline appears to be more clinically effective and cost effective than varenicline (Chantix) based on expected costs and quality-adjusted life-year, or QALY, values.
 The Cochrane Report researchers searched for randomized controlled trials testing varenicline, cytisinicline or dianicline, finding 39 studies of varenicline compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. The Cochrane Report researchers also found four trials of cytisinicline, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement therapy. The Cochrane Report also included one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in development, and so not available to use as a smoking cessation aid. To be included, trials had to report quit rates at least six months from the start of treatment. The Cochrane Report preferred the strictest available definition of quitting, and focused on results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing blood or bodily fluids. The Cochrane Report researchers conducted full searches up to May 2015, although several key trials published after that date were also included. The first cytisinicline trial included in the Cochrane Report was conducted in 1971. Since there are only two phase 3 studies with cytisinicline, the researchers that conducted the meta-analysis included in the Cochrane report determined that their meta-analysis was of poor quality.
 Over-the-Counter Treatments
 The most common OTC treatments bought in pharmacies for smoking cessation in the U.S. and worldwide are NRTs such as nicotine gums, nicotine lozenges, and nicotine patches. Each of these products delivers nicotine to the body although they generally do so at different rates and to different parts of the body than does a traditional cigarette. As concluded by the authors of several published clinical trials conducted by others, these therapies are generally less effective than prescription treatments. Recognized brands include Niquitin ® , Nicotinell ® , Nicorette ®  and Nicoderm ® . Depending on the duration of treatment, the average cost of certain OTC smoking cessation treatments can exceed prescription treatments.
 Pharmaceutical companies, including larger companies in the industry, who have extensive expertise in non-clinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for products, may develop other OTC treatments for smoking cessation. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 13 employees, of whom five were engaged in research and development functions, including clinical development, regulatory affairs and manufacturing, and eight were engaged in general and administrative functions, including accounting and finance, administration, and corporate communications. 
 All of our employees have entered into non-disclosure agreements regarding our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We believe that we maintain satisfactory relations with our employees. 
 From time to time, we also use outside consultants to provide advice on our clinical development plans, research programs, administration and potential acquisitions of new technologies.
