  3
 

The Company's strategy is to be the industry's most cost-efficient producer in each of its product lines while continuing to develop innovative new products and provide first class service for its customers.  Management believes that the Company is the technological innovator in the markets in which it operates and is well positioned to capitalize on the need to rebuild and enhance roadway and utility infrastructure as well as in other areas in which it offers products and services, both in the United States and abroad.
 
Segment Reporting
 
The Company's business units have their own management teams and offer different products and services.  The Company’s business units are aggregated into three reportable business segments based upon the nature of the product or services produced, the type of customer for the products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations.  The Company’s reportable business segments are (i) Infrastructure Group, (ii) Aggregate and Mining Group and (iii) Energy Group.  The remaining business units not included in one of the reportable segments provide support and corporate oversight for all the Company’s business units and include Astec Industries, Inc., the parent company, and Astec Insurance Company, a captive insurance company.  We refer to these two companies as the “Corporate” category throughout this document.  The Company records U.S. federal income tax expenses and state deferred taxes for all business segments on the parent company’s books; therefore, these taxes are included in the Corporate category for segment reporting.
 
Financial information in connection with the Company's financial reporting for segments of a business and for geographic areas under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 280 is included in Note 18, Operations by Industry Segment and Geographic Area, in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” presented in Appendix A of this report.
 
Infrastructure Group
 
The Infrastructure Group segment is made up of five business units.  These business units include Astec, Inc. (“Astec”), Roadtec, Inc. (“Roadtec”), Carlson Paving Products, Inc. (“Carlson”), Astec Mobile Machinery GmbH (“AMM”) and Astec Australia Pty Ltd (“Astec Australia”).  Three of the business units (Astec, Roadtec and Carlson) design, engineer, manufacture and market a complete line of asphalt plants and their related components, asphalt pavers, screeds, milling machines, material transfer vehicles, stabilizers and related ancillary equipment.  The other two business units (AMM and Astec Australia) primarily sell, service and install products produced by the manufacturing subsidiaries of the Company with a majority of their sales to customers in the infrastructure industry.  As mentioned above, AMM is in the process of being closed.
Products
 
Astec designs, engineers, manufactures and markets a complete line of asphalt and related components primarily for the asphalt production and paving industries.  Certain component equipment supplied by Astec for asphalt plants is manufactured by other Company subsidiaries such as heating and storage equipment (manufactured by the Company’s Energy Group) and material handling equipment (manufactured by the Company’s Aggregate and Mining Group).  A typical asphalt mixing plant consists of heating and storage equipment for liquid asphalt; cold feed bins for blending aggregates; a counter-flow continuous type unit (Astec Double Barrel) for drying, heating and mixing; a baghouse composed of air filters and other pollution control devices; hot storage bins or silos for temporary storage of hot-mix asphalt; and a control house. Astec introduced the concept of high plant portability for asphalt plants in 1979. Its current generation of portable asphalt plants is marketed as the Six Pack and consists of six or more portable components designed to be easily transported from one construction site to another, thereby reducing relocation expenses and interruption of operations. High plant portability is an industry innovation developed and successfully marketed by Astec.

Astec developed the patented water injection warm mix asphalt system, which allows the asphalt mix to be prepared and placed at lower temperatures than conventional systems and operates with a substantial reduction in emissions during paving and load-out. Previous technologies for warm mix production rely on expensive additives, procedures and/or special asphalt cement delivery systems that significantly increase the cost per ton of mix. The Company’s Astec multi-nozzle device eliminates the need for the expensive additives by mixing a small amount of water and asphalt cement together to create microscopic bubbles that reduce the viscosity of the liquid asphalt coating on the rock, thereby allowing the mix to be handled and worked at lower temperatures.
 
Astec is focused on producing equipment with the most advanced mix recycling technology in the industry.  More tons of recyclable asphalt pavement (“RAP”) are available than are currently being utilized due to restrictions in the amount of RAP allowed by various governmental agencies.  Astec’s recycle technology is continuously being enhanced and is providing the science to alleviate the concerns driving such restrictions and to improve RAP utilization percentages in the asphalt industry.  Astec’s latest system improvement, the RAP Pre-Dryer System, was successfully field prototyped in 2018 and is now available to the industry.  It has produced mixes of up to 80% RAP and can consistently produce mixes with 70% RAP.  Astec has also enhanced its Double Barrel equipment line by providing a system with increased drum length and an external mixer that provides the capability to use up to 65% RAP without pre-drying.
    The components in Astec's asphalt mixing plants are fully automated and use both microprocessor-based and programmable logic control systems for efficient operation. The plants are manufactured to meet or exceed federal and state clean air standards. Astec also builds batch type asphalt plants and has developed specialized asphalt recycling equipment for use with its hot-mix asphalt plants.
 
Many of the Company’s highly technical, sophisticated large asphalt plants, while ideally suited for the United States domestic market, are not as well suited in many foreign markets.  Astec is nearing completion on two newly styled plants designed especially for foreign markets where Astec’s current product offerings have not been well received.
 
Roadtec manufactures asphalt pavers, material transfer vehicles, milling machines, soil stabilizing-reclaiming machinery and other equipment used in road building and resurfacing.  Roadtec pavers have been designed to minimize maintenance costs while exceeding road surface smoothness requirements.  The equipment offered by Roadtec can be used in tandem with each other or separately with equipment already owned by the customer.
 
Roadtec's Shuttle Buggy is a mobile, self-propelled material transfer vehicle which allows continuous paving by separating truck unloading from the paving process while remixing the asphalt.  A typical asphalt paver must stop paving to permit truck unloading of asphalt mix.  By permitting continuous paving, the Shuttle Buggy allows the asphalt paver to produce a smoother road surface while reducing the time required to pave the road surface and reducing the number of haul trucks required.  As a result of the pavement smoothness achieved with this machine, certain states now require the use of the Shuttle Buggy.  Studies using infrared technology have revealed problems caused by differential cooling of the hot-mix during hauling.  The Shuttle Buggy remixes the material to a uniform temperature and gradation, thus eliminating these problems.  Roadtec’s newest versions of its highly successful Shuttle Buggy includes the Guardian System that is designed to anticipate equipment maintenance needs resulting in more uptime reliability while also providing production and performance data as well as real time location information to the owner.  Roadtec’s Spray Paver model, which is recommended for use with the Shuttle Buggy, is also designed to carry and spray tack coat directly in front of the hot mix asphalt in a single process, thus eliminating the need for a separate tack truck.

Roadtec manufactures milling machines designed to remove old asphalt from the road surface before new asphalt mix is applied.  Roadtec's line of milling machines, which are designed for larger jobs, are manufactured with a simplified control system, wide conveyors, direct drives and a wide range of horsepower and cutting capabilities to provide versatility in product application.  In addition to its half-lane and larger highway class milling machines, Roadtec also manufactures a smaller, utility class machine for two-to-four foot cutting widths and a utility class cold planer model mounted on steel wheels.
 
Roadtec currently produces soil stabilizers in configurations of 275HP, 440HP, 625HP and 755HP.  These machines double as asphalt reclaiming machines for road rehabilitations, in addition to their primary purpose of stabilizing soil sub-grades with additives to provide an improved base on which to pave.
    Carlson manufactures its patented screeds which attach to asphalt paving machines and place asphalt on the roadbed at a desired thickness and width while smoothing and compacting the surface.  Carlson screeds can be configured to fit many types of asphalt paving machines, including machines manufactured by both the Company and its competitors. The Carlson screed uses a hydraulic powered generator to electrify elements that heat a screed plate so asphalt will not stick to it while paving.  A generator is also available to power tools or lights for night paving.  Carlson offers options to its screeds which allow extended paving widths and the addition of a curb on the road edge.  Carlson also offers five models of 8 to 15 foot commercial class pavers designed for parking lots, residential driveways and secondary road applications.
 
Astec Mobile Machinery, which historically functioned primarily as a distributor of Roadtec products in the European market, ceased its operations in early 2019, and its assets are currently being liquidated.  While reviewing performance criteria against actual results of all Astec companies during a strategic planning meeting held by management in late 2018, it was determined that Astec Mobile Machinery did not meet the desired performance metrics. Documents were filed by the Company in the German court system in December 2018 to begin the process of liquidating Astec Mobile Machinery. The Company expects the liquidation of Astec Mobile Machinery to be completed in 2019. Roadtec expects to market its products directly to European customers that were previously serviced by Astec Mobile Machinery.
 
Astec Australia markets relocatable and portable asphalt plants and components produced by Astec, Heatec and CEI, asphalt paving equipment and components produced by Roadtec and Carlson, and aggregate equipment produced by the Company’s Aggregate & Mining Group.  A majority of its sales are to customers in the infrastructure industry.  In addition to selling equipment, Astec Australia provides complete support for its customers’ equipment with service, training and spare parts.  Astec Australia also provides turnkey installation solutions for large asphalt plants, aggregate and mining plants and bitumen tank farms.
 
Marketing
 
The Company markets its hot-mix asphalt products domestically under the Astec and Astec Dillman trademarks and internationally under the Astec trademarks.  Asphalt plants and related equipment are sold directly to asphalt producers or domestic and foreign government agencies through Astec's domestic sales department and the International Sales Group of Astec Industries and through a Company-owned dealership (Astec Australia).
 
The Company markets its asphalt paving equipment both domestically and internationally to highway and heavy equipment contractors, utility contractors and foreign and domestic governmental agencies both directly and through dealers (including Astec Australia in the Australian and New Zealand markets).  Mobile construction equipment and factory authorized machine rebuild services are marketed both directly and through dealers.
 
This segment’s products are marketed by 74 direct sales staff, 49 domestic independent distributors and 113 international independent distributors, including Astec’s subsidiaries in Australia and Germany (the latter of which is ceasing operations, as noted above).

Raw Materials
 
Raw materials used in the manufacture of products in the Infrastructure Group include carbon steel, pipe and various types of alloy steel, which are normally purchased from distributors and other sources.  Raw materials for manufacturing are normally readily available.  Most steel is delivered on a “just-in-time” arrangement from the supplier to reduce inventory requirements at the manufacturing facilities, but steel is occasionally inventoried after purchase.  Section 232 and Section 301 Tariffs that went into effect in 2018 have negatively impacted raw materials pricing for the group.  Other components used in the manufacturing processes include engines, gearboxes, power transmissions and electronic systems.

KPI/JCI/AMS portable plants combine various combinations of crushing, screening and conveying equipment mounted on tow away chassis and track chassis configurations.  Due to high transportation costs of construction materials, many producers use portable equipment to process materials they need in close proximity to their job sites.  Portable plants allow aggregate producers the ability to quickly and efficiently move equipment from one location to another as their jobs necessitate.   The portable track plants are fully self-contained and allow operators to be producing materials within minutes of unloading equipment off of their transport trucks.  The introduction of track-mounted crushing and screening plants has enabled contractors to perform jobs that in the past were not economically feasible and also allows our dealers to compete in the large track-mounted rental market.

Raw Materials
 
Raw materials used in the manufacture of products in the Energy Group include carbon steel and various types of alloy steel, which are normally purchased from distributors and other sources.  Raw materials for manufacturing are normally readily available.  Most steel is delivered on a “just-in-time” arrangement from suppliers to reduce inventory requirements at the manufacturing facilities, but steel is occasionally inventoried after purchase. Section 232 and Section 301 Tariffs that went into effect in 2018 have negatively impacted raw materials pricing for the group.  Components used in the manufacturing process include engines, hydraulic pumps and motors, gearboxes, track clutches, burners, power transmissions and electronic systems.
Competition
 
The Energy Group faces strong competition in price, service and product performance and competes both with large companies that have resources significantly greater than those of the Company and with various smaller manufacturers.  Major competitors include Gencor, Almix, Fulton, Sigma Thermal, Erie Strayer, Con-E-Co, Meeker, Versa Drill, Schramm, Atlas Copco, National Oil Well, Forum Energy Tech, Oil Country, NOV/Rolligon, Stewart & Stevenson, Dragon, Morbark, CBI (Terex), Precision Doppstadt, Bandit, Jenz, Komptech, Finn Corp, Webster Engineering, Cleaver Brooks, Riello, Industrial Combustion, Limpsfield Combustion and Stephen’s Manufacturing.

Common to All Operating Segments
 
The following information applies to all operating segments of the Company.
  13
 

Raw Materials
 
Steel is a major component in the Company’s equipment. Steel prices rose significantly during 2018 and were impacted by the Section 232 and 301 tariff actions. Steel prices have recently become stable at these elevated levels, and we anticipate prices to remain in this range for the first half of 2019. The Company continues to utilize forward-looking contracts (with no minimum or specified quantity guarantees) coupled with advanced steel purchases to minimize the impact of any price increases.  The Company will review the trends in steel prices entering into the second half of 2019 and establish future contract pricing accordingly.
Government Regulations
 
The Company is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, other federal agencies and certain state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on the Company’s operations.  Many of these federal and state agencies may seek fines and penalties for violations of these laws and regulations.  The Company has been able to operate under these laws and regulations without any material adverse effect on its business.
 
None of the Company's operating segments operate within highly regulated industries.  However, air pollution control equipment manufactured by the Company, principally for hot-mix asphalt plants, must comply with certain performance standards promulgated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act applicable to “new sources” or new plants.  Management believes the Company's products meet all material requirements of such regulations and applicable state pollution standards and environmental protection laws.
 
In addition, due to the size and weight of certain equipment the Company manufactures, the Company and its customers may encounter various state regulations on maximum weights transportable on highways.  Also, some states have regulations governing the operation of asphalt mixing plants, and most states have regulations relating to the accuracy of weights and measures, which affect some of the control systems manufactured by the Company.
 
Compliance with these government regulations has no material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position within the market.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 4,401 individuals, of which 3,016 were engaged in manufacturing, 505 in engineering, including support staff, and 880 in selling, administrative and management functions.
 
Other than the Telsmith, Osborn and Astec Brazil labor agreements described under the “Employee” subsection of the Aggregate and Mining Group above and the GEFCO and Power Flame labor agreements described under the “Employee” subsection of the Energy Group above, there are no collective bargaining agreements applicable to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries.  The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Manufacturing
 
The Company manufactures many of the component parts and related equipment for its products, while several large components of its products are purchased “ready-for-use”.  Such items include engines, axles, tires and hydraulics.  In many cases, the Company designs, engineers and manufactures custom component parts and equipment to meet the particular needs of individual customers.  Manufacturing operations during 2018 took place at 21 separate locations.  The Company's manufacturing operations consist primarily of fabricating steel components and the assembly and testing of its products to ensure that the Company achieves quality control standards.
Seminars and Technical Bulletins
 
The Company periodically conducts technical and service seminars, which are primarily for dealer representatives, contractors, owners, employees and other users of equipment manufactured by the Company. These seminars, which are led by Company management and employees, along with select outside speakers and discussion leaders, cover a range of subjects, including, but not limited to operational and service processes, technological innovation, promotional programs, customer and dealer training and previews of future products.
 
In addition to seminars, the Company publishes a number of technical bulletins and information bulletins detailing various technological and business issues relating to the industries in which it operates.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company seeks to obtain patents to protect the novel features of its products and processes.  The Company's subsidiaries hold 93 United States patents and 130 foreign patents.  The Company’s subsidiaries have 62 United States and 86 foreign patent applications pending.  
 
The Company and its subsidiaries have 86 trademarks registered in the United States, including logos for Astec, Astec Dillman, Carlson Paving, CEI, GEFCO, Heatec, KPI-JCI, Peterson Pacific, Power Flame, Roadtec, Telestack and Telsmith, and the names ASTEC, CARLSON, HEATEC, JCI, KOLBERG, PETERSON, POWER FLAME, ROADTEC, TELESTACK and TELSMITH, as well as a number of other product names.

Engineering and Product Development
 
The Company dedicates substantial resources to engineering and product development. At December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had 505 full-time individuals employed in engineering and design capacities.
Seasonality and Backlog
 
Revenues for recent years, adjusted for acquisitions, have been strongest during the first, second and fourth quarters with the third quarter consistently being weaker. We expect future operations in the near term to be typical of this historical trend.
     15
 

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had a backlog for delivery of products at certain dates in the future of approximately $344,962 and $411,469, respectively.  The Company's contracts reflected in the backlog generally are not, by their terms, subject to termination.  Management believes the Company is in substantial compliance with all manufacturing and delivery timetables.
 
Competition
 
Each business segment operates in domestic markets that are highly competitive with respect to price, service and product quality.  While specific competitors are named within each business segment discussion above, imports do not generally constitute significant competition for the Company in the United States, except for milling machines and track-mounted crushers.  In international sales, however, the Company often competes with foreign manufacturers that may have a local presence in the market the Company is attempting to penetrate.
 
In addition, asphalt and concrete are generally considered competitive products as a surface choice for new roads and highways.  A portion of the interstate highway system is paved in concrete, but over 90% of all surfaced roads in the United States are paved with asphalt.  Although concrete is used for some new road surfaces, asphalt is used for most resurfacing.
