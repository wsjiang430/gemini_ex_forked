Our IP Strategy and R&D Roadmap include:
 

● | Developing wellness plant-based product portfolio across the range from scientific and research-based plants, such as herbal extracts, medicinal mushrooms, and other natural ingredients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding our current product lines and registering the products for worldwide regulatory approvals. 
● | Developing complementary products for balancing selected side effects caused by medicines, treatments, aging, stress, or an unbalanced lifestyle. 
● | Researching and developing pharma solutions with the mission of developing plant-based medicines and botanical drugs. 
● | Building our patent portfolio, conducting clinical trials, and advancing our products through innovation and technology. 
● | We filed provisional patent applications in the field of Balancing Side Effects in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO): Patent Application No. 63/418,046, and Patent Application No. 63/388,361 for compositions and methods for balancing side effects associated with the use of medicines, treatments, aging and unbalanced or unhealthy lifestyle and balancing side effects related to symptoms in the oral cavity. 

About Side Effects Caused by Using Medicines, Treatments or an Unbalanced Lifestyle
 
Side effects are unexpected reactions which may result from using medicines, treatments and an unbalanced lifestyle. There are common side effects, such as dryness in the oral cavity (xerostomia), headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, lack of concentration, and impaired appetite that are associated with the use of medicines and treatments12.
 
The public health impact of harms associated with medicines and treatments is a growing area of investigation, given the expanding pharma industry and widespread availability of drugs and different medical treatments around the world. Current evidence suggests that use of medicines is associated with side effects. Exploring the relationship between drug side-effects and therapeutic indications demonstrates that 69% of drugs have between 10 and 100 different side effects; 22% of drugs have more than 100 side-effects; only 9% of drugs have less than 10 side-effects (Please see Figure 1 below)13.

Treatment of side-effects, or adverse drug reactions, has become a healthcare concern. The new market of Pharmacovigilance, also known as drug safety – the pharmaceutical science relating to the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of adverse effects with pharmaceutical products – is developing and expected to reach $12.48 Billion in 2027. Driving this are increasing public awareness and demand for safer medications and increasing government initiatives to promote drug safety around the globe14.
 
We believe that natural plant-based products show great promise in improving quality of life and can be used as complementary products to balance side effects. Antibiotics and probiotics are an excellent use case. Antibiotics are important for treating bacterial infections; however, they can sometimes cause side effects such as diarrhea, liver disease and changes to the gut microbiota. Using probiotics during and after a treatment with antibiotics can help reduce the risk of diarrhea and restore the gut microbiota to a healthy state15.
 
Addressing a significant market need, we included in our strategy the development of plant based complementary solutions through wellness as well as clinically developing plant-based pharmaceutical products to address the need to balance selected effects and support people who experience side effects from using medicines, cannabis, and various treatments.
 
Oral Cavity Dry-Mouth -Side-Effect
 
Research shows that the overall estimated prevalence of dry mouth is over one in four people in the general population with higher prevalence rates observed in studies conducted with elderly people16 demonstrating that oral cavity-related symptoms are linked to different factors, such as using medicines, treatments, aging, an unbalanced or unhealthy lifestyle, various chronic diseases, psychological reasons, stress, and more17.
 
It is important to maintain the saliva level in the mouth to prevent problems and damage, as saliva plays a key role in maintaining health in the oral cavity. Saliva contains calcium and phosphorous which protects teeth, helps the digestive system, prevents bad smell through balancing the acidity that comes from food and bacteria, has enzymes that help break down food, washes food scraps and bacteria, and helps speech as pronunciation of movements and syllables is done with saliva and tongue.
 
The Dry Mouth Treatment Market is expected to reach $1.81 billion by 203218.
 
In July 2022, we filed a provisional patent application for “COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING, AMELIORATING, ALLEVIATING, MITIGATING OR BALANCING SIDE-EFFECTS IN THE ORAL CAVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MEDICINES, TREATMENTS, AGING OR UNBALANCED/UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE”, patent No: 63/388,361 in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. The patent application relates to compositions and methods for answering the need for treatment, amelioration, alleviation, mitigation, or balance of side effects in the Oral Cavity related to medications, treatments, using cannabis 24, smoking, adult population experiencing constant dry mouth and unhealthy lifestyle.

Side Effects from Cannabis Use
 
Following thorough investigation of cannabis’ side effects, we filed a provisional patent application titled “PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SIDE-EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF CANNABIS, CANNABINOIDS AND RELATED PRODUCTS”, patent No: 63/257,673 in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. In October 2022 we filed an extension to the provisional patent application No: 63/257,673 in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office by filing a provisional patent application patent No: 63/418,046 for “COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING, AMELIORATING, ALLEVIATING, MITIGATING OR BALANCING SIDE-EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MEDICINES, TREATMENTS, AGING, CANNABIS, AND UNBALANCED OR UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE”. The patent application describes common side effects associated with the use of medicines, treatments, aging, cannabis and cannabinoids, and unbalanced or unhealthy life style, such as headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, lack of concentration, impaired appetite, and more.

The Health & Wellness Industries Global Market Size and Potential:
 
The global health and wellness market is expected to reach USD 7.6 trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2021 to 2030. The hectic, unbalanced lifestyle has resulted in the prevalence of lack of proper diet and sleep, stress, depression, anxiety, cancer, diabetes, and various other health related issues. Lack of proper diet has resulted in the reduced intake of essential nutrients and minerals required for the healthy and active functioning of the human body. Precedence research identifies growth opportunities to the health and wellness market players across the globe in the adoption of smart technologies and innovative ways in manufacturing various health and wellness products, nutritional supplements, healthy snacks and beverages, the growing biopharmaceutical industry and development of botanical drugs41.
 
Health and wellness have been found by Nielsen IQ researchers to be the most powerful consumer force of 2021. In contrast to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19, consumers are being very deliberate with their choices. A survey conducted discovered that consumers emphasize having meaningful and purposeful living, health management, strength and wellness, mental health and stability, happiness, social connections, environmental betterment, balance, and fulfillment. We are witnessing a global movement of health and wellbeing becoming a priority for the public, further emphasized by the global COVID-19 pandemic. There is increasing recognition that people need to take charge of their own health, improve their quality of life, use natural products, and balance side effects caused by medicines and treatment42.

The global nutritional supplements market is expected to reach USD 624.7 billion by 2030 and is expanding growth at a CAGR of 7.1% over the forecast period 2021 to 2030 with plant-based supplements containing natural ingredients and extracts of plants and mushrooms that have a beneficial biological effect48. The global superfoods market is expected to reach USD 214.95 billion by 2027 with superfoods being foods that have a very high nutritional density. This means they provide a substantial amount of nutrients and very few calories. They contain a high volume of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.
 
Growth in the nutritional supplements is driven by growing awareness of health and safety in the traditional pharma, food, and beverage industries as well as higher healthcare costs. Authentic consumption has become a major food and beverage trend as consumers increasingly seek natural ingredients. Products such as ginseng, echinacea, ginkgo biloba, and garlic, the top selling botanical products are considered natural remedies for inflammation and infections. This is further driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, with consumers looking to strengthen the natural immune system. This is also driving growth of vitamins and minerals and moving towards natural colorant-based plant juice products, since they provide better and long-lasting protection from viruses and bacteria. In addition, botanicals and nutritional supplements are widely used by people who suffer from diseases related to weight management, clinical nutrition, digestive health (gut health problems), immunity, diabetes, and cardio fitness, either as treatment or prevention49.
 
We believe that the market demand for Nutritional Supplements is driven by50:
 

● | Increasing attention to health and prevention by the consumers 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Greater customization of needs for different segments of the population 
● | Increased health care costs and search for alternatives to cure specific problems

The Botanical and Plant-derived Drug Market
 
The global botanical and plant-derivative drug market is anticipated to grow to $53 billion by 2026 driven by growing applications in diseases, technological developments in manufacturing processes and a growing focus and demand for naturally sourced medicines51.
 
Botanical drugs are derived from natural sources, plants and mushrooms, and are considered to have fewer side-effects as compared to synthetic drugs while showing high efficacy in helping to treat different medical conditions and chronic diseases52.
 
The important driver for growth in the global botanical and plant-derivative drug market is its growing applications in diseases. Botanical drugs are derivative of medicinal plants and may contain algae and vegetable substances, along with macroscopic fungi. These may assist in the treatment of various diseases, such as central nervous system disorders, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. Botanical and plant derivative drugs are available in various forms, such as pills, tablets, and injections53.
 
The Botanical and plant-derivative drug market is primarily driven by the following factors 54
 

● | Growing applications in diseases 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Growing FDA approvals 
● | Technological development in the manufacturing process 
● | Rising demand for traditional medicines 
● | Growing focus on natural source medicines 

The Global Cannabis Market
 
The global legal cannabis market size is expected to reach USD 70.6 billion by 2028 driven mainly by increased legalization of cannabis for medical and adult-use and the growing adoption of these products for the treatment of chronic diseases55.
 
There are currently over 200 million cannabis users worldwide and an increased interest in cannabis as a medicine in recent years56. Cannabis was approved for medical use showing benefit in serious medical conditions including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, epilepsy, chronic pain, and post trauma. Research indicates that some medical cannabis users experience side effects during their cannabis treatment, which may cause them to discontinue treatment despite good clinical outcomes achieved with the cannabis treatment57.
 
The Global Natural Cosmetics Market
 
The global natural cosmetics market is projected to reach USD 24.86 billion by 2028 driven mainly by increasing demand for harmful chemical-free cosmetics, rising awareness against the use of animal derivatives and growing social media movements endorsing naturally derived products58.
 
The cosmetic and personal care segment of botanicals is also on the rise with companies increasingly discovering novel herbal ingredients as consumers are seeking more natural products with ingredients that are of plant origin: extracts or oils obtained from raw plant materials. Natural cosmetics are cosmetics that have ingredients of plant origin. The absence of chemical compounds and animal-by products are specifically suited to sensitive skin people. The natural cosmetic products are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Many companies in the field focus on the production of natural cosmetics that are cruelty-free as these products have increasing demand59.

Current evidence suggests that use of medicines, and medical treatments are associated with a series of side effects. For example, exploring the relationship between drug side-effects and therapeutic indications demonstrate that 69% of drugs have between 10 and 100 different side effects; 22% of drugs have more than 100 side-effects; only 9% of drugs have fewer than 10 side-effects (Please see Figure 7 below)60

Drug side-effects, or adverse drug reactions, have become a healthcare concern. The new market of Pharmacovigilance, also known as drug safety—the pharmaceutical science relating to the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of adverse effects with pharmaceutical products—is developing and expected to reach $12.48 billion in 2027. Driving this are increasing public awareness and demand for safer medications and increasing government initiatives to promote drug safety around the globe61.

Regulatory Environment
 
In every jurisdiction in which we plan to operate, we will be subject to extensive governmental regulations on the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, promoting, importing, distributing, shipping, and selling our products, may they be nutritional supplements, cosmetics, foods, or any other category.
 
Prior to commencing operations and/or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license, or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or another responsible agency. Prior to entering a new market, we plan to work with local authorities, either directly or via our local partner, to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process usually requires us to present each product and product ingredients and, in some cases, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis.
 
We or our local partners would need to obtain various regulatory approvals and licenses for our different product lines and activities, including production of botanicals, nutritional supplements, natural snacks and beverages, and natural cosmetics. We intend to obtain all regulatory approvals required for different product categories in the different countries in which we will operate either directly or through our local partners.
 
We describe in this section primarily the material regulations that are currently applicable to our products.
 
Regulatory Environment for the Our Products
 
While the number of people using nutritional supplements and herbal medicine products continues to increase in many countries, the regulations for these products vary by territory. In some countries supplement use is limited to general health and well-being while in other countries they are permitted for use as medicinal products. To date, there is little consensus from country to country on the scope, requirements, definition, or even the terminology in which the nutritional supplement and herbal medicines categories could be classified62.
 
Our products are regulated in Israel as nutritional supplements and meet all regulatory compliance requirements for nutritional supplements in Israel. iBOT Israel Botanicals, our manufacturing facility for our products, is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health and is GMP-certified.
 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. GMP covers all aspects of production from the starting materials, premises, and equipment to the training and personal hygiene of staff. Detailed written procedures are essential for each process that could affect the quality of the finished product. There must be systems to provide documented proof that correct procedures are consistently followed at each step in the manufacturing process - every time a product is made63. The National Food Service (NFS) is the regulatory body at the Israeli Ministry of Health, that is responsible for food and nutritional supplements approval. The NFS strictly examines the safety and quality of each nutritional supplement product that is about to be registered and marketed in Israel64.
 
We currently expect to launch our products in Europe in the first half of 2023. We will obtain all relevant regulatory approvals for the products before launching them in other territories, such as European countries and the U.S..
 
The Israeli Ministry of Health maintains a comprehensive list of authorized nutritional supplements for marketing. This list includes over a thousand different vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs including their extracts. Items under this list can be legally marketed, however, no medical claims can be made without adequate supporting information. The final products can be in various forms such as powders, tablets, hard or soft capsules, liquids, including oils and tinctures. Each product must be manufactured under GMP conditions and be approved by the Ministry of Health prior to selling.
 
Regulatory Compliance for the Green Vision Center Israel
 
We acquired 125,000 sq ft (11,687 sqm), or approximately three acres, of industrial land in the south of Israel upon which a 65,000 sq. ft. (~5,800 sqm) facility will be built composed of manufacturing plants, laboratories, logistics, import and export, offices, training, conference center, and an international visitor complex. The center will be constructed by a real estate professional project construction company and regulatory consultants in the relevant fields that will obtain the required authorizations.

Our Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 26, 2010 under the name “TechCare Corp.”.
 
On January 6, 2020, our predecessor company, TechCare Corp., a Delaware corporation (“TechCare”), and Citrine S A L Investment & Holdings Ltd., an Israeli corporation and a major shareholder of our company (“Citrine S A L”), and a group of related persons and entities (the “Citrine S A L Group”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Citrine S A L Group Agreement”), which was later amended and restated on February 23, 2020 (the “AR Citrine S A L Group Agreement”). Pursuant to the AR Citrine Agreement, TechCare agreed to sell Citrine S A L Group and its group of business partners, up to an aggregate of 893,699,276 shares of TechCare’s common stock, representing approximately 95% of TechCare’s fully diluted capital, in two tranches, with the initial tranche of up to 452,063,196 shares of the TechCare’s common stock to be sold conditioned upon (i) the resignation of the then members of its board of directors, (ii) the appointment of the current members of the Board, and (iii) the transfer of the TechCare’s signatory rights to all Company bank accounts in the name of Citrine S A L Group’s nominee. In addition, the AR Citrine S A L Group Agreement provides for the second tranche of up to the remaining number of shares of common stock that will result in Citrine S A L Group, owning 95% of the TechCare’s fully diluted capital stock, to be sold conditioned upon the filing of the Company’s previously approved amendment to its First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized capital. Shares of the Company were issued and sold in accordance with this amended agreement to Citrine S A L Group on February 27, 2020, March 5, 2020, and, after the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized share capital, on November 11, 2020.
