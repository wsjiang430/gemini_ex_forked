Recent Acquisitions
 
Delaware Bancshares, Inc.  On July 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Delaware Bancshares, Inc. (“Delaware”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The National Bank of Delaware County (“NBDC”).  At the time of acquisition, Delaware had approximately $375.6 million in assets and 12 banking offices in Delaware and Sullivan Counties, New York.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 10, 2016, by and among the Company, Wayne Bank, Delaware and NBDC (the “Delaware Agreement”), Delaware was merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation of the merger (the “Merger”) and NBDC was merged with and into Wayne Bank immediately thereafter.  At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of the common stock of Delaware was converted, at the election of the holder but subject to the limitations and allocation and proration provisions set forth in the Delaware Agreement, into either $16.68 in cash or 0.6221 of a share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”).  In the aggregate, the merger consideration paid to Delaware shareholders consisted of approximately $3,860,000 in cash and 431,605 shares of the Common Stock.

Competition
 
The competition for deposit products comes from other insured financial institutions such as commercial banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, and multi-state regional banks in the Company’s market area of Wayne, Pike, Monroe and Lackawanna Counties, Pennsylvania and Delaware and Sullivan Counties, New York as well as from on-line banks. Based on data compiled by the FDIC as of June 30, 2018 (the latest date for which such data is available), the Bank had the third largest share of FDIC-insured deposits in Wayne County with approximately 21.9%, the second largest share in Pike County with 19.9%, seventh largest share in Monroe County with 3.8% and tenth largest share in Lackawanna County with 1.2%.  At June 30, 2018, the Bank had the second largest share of FDIC-insured deposits in Delaware County, New York, with 25.5% and the seventh largest share in Sullivan County, New York, with 6.3%.  This data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions with which the Bank also competes. Deposit competition also includes a number of insurance products sold by local agents and investment products such as mutual funds and other securities sold by local and regional brokers. Loan competition varies depending upon market conditions and comes from other insured financial institutions such as commercial banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, multi-state regional banks, and mortgage bankers.
Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 203 full‑time and 7 part‑time employees. None of the Bank’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining group.

Lending Activities
 
The Bank’s loan products include loans for personal and business use. Personal lending includes mortgage lending to finance principal residences and, to a lesser extent, second home dwellings. The Bank’s loan products include fixed-rate mortgage products with terms up to 30 years which may be sold in the secondary market through the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the FHLB, or held in the Bank’s portfolio to the extent consistent with our asset/liability management strategies. Fixed-rate home equity loans are originated on terms up to 180 months.  Home equity lines of credit tied to the prime rate are also offered. The Bank also offers indirect dealer financing of automobiles (new and used), boats, and recreational vehicles through a limited network of dealers in Northeast Pennsylvania and the Southern Tier of New York.  At December 31, 2018, there were $100.9 million of indirect loans in the portfolio.  In connection with the acquisition of Delaware Bancshares, Inc., the Company acquired approximately $116.7 million in loans, including $68.7 million in residential real estate loans, $22.5 million in commercial real estate loans, $13.6 million in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, $6.5 million in consumer loans and $5.4 in construction loans.  As of December 31, 2018, the approximate outstanding balance of these acquired loans was $70.8 million.  In connection with the acquisition of North Penn Bancorp, Inc., the Company acquired approximately $119.7 million in loans, including $36.2 million in residential real estate loans, $70.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $10.5 million in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, $1.8 million in consumer loans and $358,000 in construction loans.  As of December 31, 2018, the approximate outstanding balance of these acquired loans was $25.6 million.
 
Commercial loans and commercial mortgages are provided to local small and mid-sized businesses at a variety of terms and rate structures.  Commercial lending activities include lines of credit, revolving credit, term loans, mortgages, various forms of secured lending and a limited amount of letter of credit facilities. The rate structure may be fixed, immediately repricing tied to the prime rate or adjustable at set intervals.  Also included in commercial loans are municipal finance lending in which the Bank has been active in recent years.  Municipal lending includes both general obligations of local taxing authorities and revenue obligations of specific revenue producing projects such as sewer authorities and educational units.   At December 31, 2018, the Bank had approximately $71.8 million in loans on commercial rentals, as well as $59.7 million of loans outstanding to the hospitality lodging industry, which are its largest lending concentrations.
 
The Bank’s construction lending has primarily involved lending for commercial construction projects and for single-family residences. All loans for the construction of speculative sale homes have a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 80%. For both commercial and single-family projects, loan proceeds are disbursed during the construction phase according to a draw schedule based on the stage of completion. Construction projects are inspected by contracted inspectors or bank personnel. Construction loans are underwritten on the basis of the estimated value of the property as completed. For commercial projects, the Bank typically also provides the permanent financing after the construction period, as a commercial mortgage.
 
The Bank also, from time to time, originates loans secured by undeveloped land. Land loans granted to individuals have a term of up to five years. Land loans granted to developers may have an interest only period during development. The substantial majority of land loans have a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 75%. The Bank has limited its exposure to land loans but may expand its lending on raw land, as market conditions allow, to qualified borrowers experienced in the development and sale of raw land.
 
Loans involving construction financing and loans on raw land have a higher level of risk than loans for the purchase of existing homes since collateral values, land values, development costs and construction costs can only be estimated at the time the loan is approved. The Bank has sought to minimize its risk in construction lending and in lending for the purchase of raw land by offering such financing primarily to 
 
 5
 

builders and developers to whom the Bank has loaned funds in the past and to persons who have previous experience in such projects. The Bank also limits construction lending and loans on raw land to its market area, with which management is familiar.
 
Adjustable-rate loans decrease the risks associated with changes in interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because as interest rates increase, the underlying payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for payment default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate may also be limited by the maximum periodic interest rate adjustment permitted in certain adjustable-rate mortgage loan documents, and, therefore is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. These risks have not had an adverse effect on the Bank.
 
The Bank’s adjustable-rate loan portfolio includes approximately $2.7 million in loan participations indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) which is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021.  The Bank anticipates that the terms of LIBOR-based loans, which have not matured prior to the phase-out of LIBOR will be negotiated to incorporate a to-be-determined substitute reference rate.  The Bank must rely on the lead bank to renegotiate the terms of loans in which the Bank has a participation.  There can be no assurance that the lead bank will be able to successfully renegotiate the loans in which the Bank has participations or that the substitute reference rate will perform as satisfactorily as LIBOR.
 
Consumer lending, including indirect financing, provides benefits to the Bank’s asset/liability management program by reducing the Bank’s exposure to interest rate changes, due to their generally shorter terms. Such loans may entail additional credit risks compared to owner-occupied residential mortgage lending especially when unsecured or secured by collateral such as automobiles that depreciate rapidly.
 
Commercial lending including real-estate related loans entail significant additional risks when compared with residential real estate and consumer lending. For example, commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the project and these risks can be significantly impacted by the cash flow of the borrowers and market conditions for commercial office, retail, and warehouse space. In periods of decreasing cash flows, the commercial borrower may permit a lapse in general maintenance of the property causing the value of the underlying collateral to deteriorate. The liquidation of commercial property is often more costly and may involve more time to sell than residential real estate. The Bank offsets such factors with requiring more owner equity, a lower loan to value ratio and by obtaining the personal guaranties of the principals. In addition, a majority of the Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio is owner-occupied property.
 
Commercial loans and leases are considered to have a higher degree of credit risk than secured real estate lending. The repayment of unsecured commercial business loans is wholly dependent on the success of the borrower’s business, while secured commercial business loans may be secured by collateral that may not be readily marketable in the event of default.  Municipal financing includes lending to local taxing authorities and revenue-producing projects.  Such loans may constitute the general obligation of the taxing authority or may rely on a specific revenue source which is responsible for the repayment of the debt.  General obligations are considered to carry a lower level of risk than other loan types since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the taxing authority. Revenue obligations are backed solely by revenues generated by the project financed and repayment may be affected by the success of the project.
 
Due to the type and nature of the collateral, consumer lending generally involves more credit risk when compared with residential real estate lending. Consumer lending collections are typically dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job

 loss, divorce, illness and personal bankruptcy. In most cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan will not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency is usually turned over to a collection agency.
 
There are additional risks associated with indirect lending since we must rely on the dealer to provide accurate information to us and accurate disclosures to the borrowers. These loans are principally done on a non-recourse basis. We seek to mitigate these risks by only dealing with dealers with whom we have a long-standing relationship.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) prohibits lenders from making residential mortgages unless the lender makes a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the mortgage loan according to its terms.  A borrower may recover statutory damages equal to all finance charges and fees paid within three years of a violation of the ability-to-repay rule and may raise a violation as a defense to foreclosure at any time.  As authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has adopted regulations defining “qualified mortgages” that are presumed to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act’s ability-to-repay rules.  Under the CFPB regulations, qualified mortgages must satisfy the following criteria: (i) no negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or term greater than 30 years; (ii) no points or fees in excess of 3% of the loan amount for loans over $100,000; (iii) borrower’s income and assets are verified and documented; and (iv) the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio generally may not exceed 43%.  Qualified mortgages are conclusively presumed to comply with the ability-to-pay rule unless the mortgage is a “higher cost” mortgage, in which case the presumption is rebuttable.  Under the recently-enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), residential mortgages originated for portfolio by insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets will be treated as qualified mortgages; provided that the mortgage terms do not include interest-only payments or negative amortization, total points and fees do not exceed 3% of the loan amount, prepayment penalties are not in excess of those permitted for qualified mortgages under Regulation Z and the lender has considered and documented the debt, income and financial resources of the borrower.
 
Loan Solicitation and Processing
 
The Bank has established various lending limits for its officers and also maintains an Officer Loan Committee to approve higher loan amounts. The Officer Loan Committee is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer and other Bank officers. The Officer Loan Committee has the authority to approve all loans up to set limits based on the type of loan and the collateral. Requests in excess of these limits must be submitted to the Directors’ Loan Committee or Board of Directors for approval. Additionally, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Lending Officer and other officers have the authority to approve secured and unsecured loans up to amounts approved by the Board of Directors and maintained in the Bank’s Loan Policy. Notwithstanding individual lending authority, certain loan policy exceptions must be submitted to the Officer Loan Committee for approval.
 
Hazard insurance coverage is required on all properties securing loans made by the Bank. Flood insurance is also required, when applicable.
 
Loan applicants are notified of the credit decision by letter. If the loan is approved, the loan commitment specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount, interest rate, amortization term, a brief description of the required collateral, and the required insurance coverage. The borrower must provide proof of fire, flood (if applicable) and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral and title insurance, and these applicable insurances must be maintained during the full term of the loan.

*Includes non-accrual TDRs of $110,000, $144,000, $477,000, $5.7 million, and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company also had $977,000, $996,000, $1.0 million, $1.1 million, and $6.6 million in accruing TDRs, respectively, on those dates.
 
The recorded investment in impaired loans, not requiring an allowance for loan losses was $1,319,000 (net of a charge-off against the allocation for loan losses of $428,000) and $1,247,000 (net of a charge-off against the allowance for loan losses of $277,000) at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There were no impaired loans requiring an allowance on December 31, 2018 or 2017. The specific reserve related to impaired loans was $0 for 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the average recorded investment in these impaired loans was $1,220,000 and $1,232,000, respectively, and the interest income recognized on these impaired loans was $67,000 and $56,000, respectively.  In connection with the Delaware Bancshares acquisition, the Company acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality with an unpaid balance of $2.6 million, which are being carried at their fair value of $748,000.  In connection with the North Penn acquisition, the Company acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality with an unpaid balance of $1.9 million, which are being carried at their fair value of $307,000.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there were no loans not previously disclosed in the above table, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.
 
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans.  Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of financial difficulties experienced by the borrower, who could not obtain comparable terms from alternate financing sources.  During 2018, there were no new loan relationships identified as troubled debt restructures.
 
Classified Assets.  Management has instituted an internal loan review program, whereby weaker credits are classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. When a loan is classified as substandard or doubtful, management is required to establish a valuation reserve for loan losses in an amount that is deemed prudent. When management classifies a loan as a loss asset, a reserve equal to 100% of the loan balance is required to be established or the loan is to be charged-off. The allowance for loan losses is composed of an allowance for both inherent risk associated with lending activities and particular problem assets.
 An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses are required to be designated special mention by management.
 Management’s evaluation of the classification of assets and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis and by the regulatory agencies as part of their examination process.

Regulation
 Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws which relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.
 Regulation of the Company
 
General. The Company, as a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve.  The Company is required to file periodic reports of its operations with, and is subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that the Company limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of its subsidiary bank.
 
Under the BHCA, the Company generally must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares.
 
Federal statutes impose restrictions on the ability of a bank holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries to obtain extensions of credit from its subsidiary bank, on the subsidiary bank’s investments in the stock or securities of the holding company, and on the subsidiary bank’s taking of the holding company’s stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services by the subsidiary bank.
 
Source of Strength Doctrine.  A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital‑raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve regulations, or both.
 
Non-Banking Activities. The business activities of the Company, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the BHCA. Under the BHCA and the Federal Reserve’s bank holding company regulations, the Company may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in, (1) banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the BHCA and (2) any BHCA activity the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. These include any incidental activities necessary to carry on those activities, as well as a lengthy list of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking as to be a proper incident thereto.
 
 17
 
Financial Modernization. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a new type of financial services company known as a “financial holding company.”  A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The Act also permits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are “financial in nature” or “incidental” to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if it and each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized and well managed, and each of its subsidiary banks has at least a “satisfactory” CRA rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. The Company has not submitted notice to the Federal Reserve of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA. The Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy guidelines are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See “Regulation of the Bank-Regulatory Capital Requirements.” As directed by EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve has amended its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to exempt from the regulatory capital requirements bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC.  As long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications.
 
Regulation of the Bank
 General. As a Pennsylvania chartered, FDIC-insured commercial bank which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the Department and by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, the reserves required to be kept against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the federal and state banking agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC or the United States Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.
 Pennsylvania Banking Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code (“Banking Code”) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state chartered banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), however, prohibits state-chartered banks from making new investments, loans, or becoming involved in activities as principal and equity investments which are not permitted for national banks unless (1) the FDIC determines the activity or investment does 
 
 18
 
not pose a significant risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund and (2) the bank meets all applicable capital requirements. Accordingly, the additional operating authority provided to the Bank by the Banking Code is significantly restricted by the FDIA.
 Interstate Banking.  As a result of the acquisition of Delaware Bancshares, Inc., Wayne Bank now operates branches in Pennsylvania and New York.  Under the federal Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (the “Riegle-Neal Act”), an insured state bank that establishes a branch in another state may conduct any activity at such branch that is permissible under the laws of its home state to the extent that such activity is permissible either for a bank chartered by the host state or for a branch of an out-of-state national bank in the host state.  The laws of the host state, including laws regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending and branching within the host state, apply to any branch of an out-of-state bank to the same extent as such laws apply to a branch of an out-of-state national bank.  The Riegle-Neal Act prohibits out-of-state banks from using their interstate branches primarily for purposes of deposit production.  If a federal banking regulator reasonably determines from available information that an out-of-state bank’s level of lending in a host state is less than half the loan-to-deposit ratio for all banks in the host state, the regulator may order the closure of the out-of-state branches or prohibit the opening of new branches in the host state unless the out-of-state bank has an acceptable plan or can give reasonable assurances that it will reasonably help meet the credit needs of the communities served in the host state.
 Federal Deposit Insurance. The Bank’s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000.
 
The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution’s risk rating.  The assessment base is the institution’s average consolidated assets less average tangible equity.  Insured banks with more than $1.0 billion in assets must calculate quarterly average assets based on daily balances while smaller banks and newly chartered banks may use weekly averages.  In the case of a merger, the average assets of the surviving bank for the quarter must include the average assets of the merged institution for the period in the quarter prior to the merger. Average assets are reduced by goodwill and other intangibles.  Average tangible equity equals Tier 1 capital. For institutions with more than $1.0 billion in assets, average tangible equity is calculated on a weekly basis while smaller institutions may use the quarter-end balance.
 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC amended its assessment regulations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets to replace the previous four risk categories with updated financial ratios that are designed to better predict the risk of failure of insured institutions.  The amended rules will remain in effect until the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 2.0%.  The amended regulations set a maximum rate that banks rated CAMELS 1 or 2 may be charged and a minimum rate that CAMELS 3, 4 and 5 banks may be charged.  Under the amended rules, the FDIC uses a bank’s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and the following financial measures to determine assessments: Tier 1 leverage ratio; ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; ratio of non-performing loans to gross assets; and ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets.  In addition, assessments take into consideration core deposits to total assets, one-year asset growth and a loan mix index.  The loan mix measures the extent to which a bank’s total assets include higher risk loans.  To calculate the loan mix index, each category of loan in the bank’s portfolio (other than credit card loans) is divided by the bank’s total assets to determine the percentage of assets represented by that loan category.  Each percentage is then multiplied by that loan category’s historical weighted average industry-wide charge-off rate.  The sum of these numbers determines the loan mix index value for that bank.  The amended regulations are intended to be revenue neutral to the FDIC but to shift premium payments to higher risk institutions.
 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), an agency of the Federal 
 
 19
 
government established to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged approximately 0.003% of insured deposits on an annualized basis in fiscal year 2018. These assessments are anticipated to continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FDIC has promulgated capital adequacy requirements for state-chartered banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System.  Effective January 1, 2015, the capital adequacy requirements were substantially revised to conform to the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord often referred to as “Basel III”.  The final rule applies to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.
 
Under the FDIC’s revised capital adequacy regulations, banks are required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) a “Tier 1” or “core” capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4% of total adjusted assets; (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8% of total risk-weighted assets.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless the bank has made an “opt-out” election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets.  Tier 1 or core capital is defined as common equity Tier 1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments.  Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments.  An institution’s risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight.  Risk weightings range from 0% for cash to 100% for property acquired through foreclosure, commercial loans, and certain other assets to 150% for exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.  Pursuant to EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies may only apply a heightened risk weight to a higher volatility commercial real estate exposure that constitutes a higher volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development or construction loan as defined in EGRRCPA and which was originated on or after January 1, 2015.
 
In addition to higher capital requirements, the new capital rules require banks and covered financial institution holding companies to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements.  Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management.  The capital buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016.  The fully phased-in capital buffer requirement will effectively raise the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis.
 
In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary.
 
EGRRCPA directs the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio of tangible capital to average total consolidated assets of between 8% and 10% as an alternative to the current leverage and risk-based capital rules for qualifying community banks and satisfying any other leverage or capital requirements to which they are subject.  Qualifying community banks meeting the community bank

leverage ratio would also be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules.   A qualifying community bank is a depository institution or holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion that is not excluded from qualification by the federal banking regulators based on the institution’s risk profile. Under regulations proposed by the federal banking agencies, a qualifying community bank may opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework if its community bank leverage ratio exceeds 9%. The proposed regulations would define tangible equity as total bank equity capital less: (i) accumulated other comprehensive income; (ii) intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets); and (iii) deferred tax assets (net of related valuation allowances) arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Under the proposal, a qualifying community bank must have total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancellable commitments) of 25% of less of total consolidated assets, total trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets, mortgage servicing assets of 25% or less of tangible equity and temporary difference deferred tax assets of less than 25% of tangible equity.
 
The Bank is also subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the Department on Pennsylvania-chartered depository institutions. Under the Department’s capital requirements, a Pennsylvania bank or savings bank must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined under the FDIC’s capital regulations) to total assets of 4%. In addition, the Department has the supervisory discretion to require higher leverage ratio for any institutions based on the institution’s substandard performance in any of a number of areas. The Bank was in compliance with both the FDIC and Pennsylvania capital requirements in effect as of December 31, 2018.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.  Under applicable federal statutes, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements.  For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  Under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or better and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% or better and a Leverage Ratio of 4.0% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 4.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a Leverage Ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%
 
The prompt corrective action regulations provide for the imposition of a variety of requirements and limitations on institutions that fail to meet the above capital requirements.  In particular, the FDIC may require any non-member bank that is not “adequately capitalized” to take certain action to increase its capital ratios. If the non-member bank’s capital is significantly below the minimum required levels of capital or if it is unsuccessful in increasing its capital ratios, the bank’s activities may be restricted.
 
Under the proposed community bank leverage ratio regulations, a qualifying community bank would be deemed: well capitalized if it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%; adequately capitalized if its community bank leverage ratio is 7.5% or greater; undercapitalized if its community bank leverage ratio is less than 7.5% and significantly undercapitalized if its community bank leverage ratio is less than 6%. A qualifying community bank will continue to be treated as critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less.

At December 31, 2018, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
 
Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. In particular, loans by a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of a bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus. Further, loans and other extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts.  Transactions with non-affiliates may be treated as transactions with an affiliate to the extent that proceeds from the transaction are used to benefit the affiliate. Federal law also requires that all transactions between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Under Pennsylvania law, commercial banks have, subject to certain exemptions, lending limits to one borrower in an amount equal to 15% of the institution’s capital accounts. An institution’s capital account includes the aggregate of all capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and general reserves for loan losses. Pursuant to the national bank parity provisions of the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the Bank may also lend up to the maximum amounts permissible for national banks, which are allowed to make loans to one borrower of up to 25% of capital and surplus in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limitation was $15.6 million and the Bank was in compliance with such limitation.
    Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Trustees of the FHLB.
 
As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain restricted stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year or 5% of the Bank’s outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.  The FHLB incurred losses in both 2009 and 2010 and suspended the payment of dividends.  However, the FHLB has shown positive results since 2011 which includes stock redemptions and resumed dividend payments. The losses were primarily attributable to impairment of investment securities associated with the extreme economic conditions in place during the previous several years.  Management evaluated the stock and concluded that the stock was not impaired for the periods presented herein.  More consideration was given to the long-term prospects for the FHLB as opposed to the recent stress caused by the extreme economic conditions that the world is facing.  Management also considered that the FHLB’s regulatory capital ratios have increased from the prior year, liquidity appears adequate, and new shares of FHLB stock continue to change hands at the $100 par value.
 
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (primarily checking and NOW accounts) and non-personal time deposits. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy the liquidity requirements that are imposed by the Department. At December 31, 2018, the Bank met its reserve requirements.
 
Restrictions on Dividends. The Pennsylvania Banking Code states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings and may not be declared or paid unless surplus (retained earnings) is at least equal to contributed capital. The Bank has not declared or paid any dividends 
 
 22
 

which cause the Bank’s retained earnings to be reduced below the amount required. Finally, dividends may not be declared or paid if the Bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC.
 
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In a recent Supervisory Letter, the Federal Reserve staff has stated that, as a general matter, bank holding companies should eliminate cash dividends if net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividend. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
 
Volcker Rule.  Effective July 21, 2015, banking entities, which include insured depository institutions, their holding companies and affiliates of either, became subject to regulations implementing the so-called Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits proprietary trading for the entity’s own account in certain financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, futures and options but excluding loans, physical commodities and foreign exchange and currency.  Under the rules adopted by the federal financial regulatory agencies, the purchase or sale of a financial instrument that has been held for less than 60 days is presumed to be proprietary trading for the purpose of short-term resale or benefiting from short-term price movements or for another prohibited purpose unless the banking organization can demonstrate a contrary purpose.  Purchases and sales of financial instruments pursuant to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities lending agreements, however, are excluded from the definition of proprietary trading. Also excluded from the definition of proprietary trading are purchases and sales of financial instruments where the bank is acting solely as agent for a customer, as trustee for a pension or deferred compensation plan or in connection with the collection of debts previously contracted.  Purchases and sales of highly liquid securities that are not reasonably expected to result in short-term trading gains and in an amount consistent with near-term funding needs are excluded from proprietary trading if conducted pursuant to a documented liquidity management plan.  Certain proprietary trading activities are permitted if conducted in connection with underwriting or market-making activities or risk-mitigating hedging activities.  Proprietary trading is also permitted in U.S. government, agency and government sponsored-enterprise securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions and the FDIC but not in derivatives of the foregoing.
 
The Volcker Rule also prohibits banking entities from sponsoring or directly or indirectly acquiring as principal any ownership interest in a “covered fund” unless permitted by the rule.  For purposes of this prohibition, a covered fund is any investment fund such as a hedge or private equity fund that would be required to register as an investment company under SEC rules but for the statutory exemptions for funds held by not more than 100 persons or owned solely by high net worth investors, any exempt or substantively similar non-exempt commodity pool and certain foreign investment funds.  Excluded from the definition of covered fund are wholly owned subsidiaries of a banking entity or its affiliates, certain permissible joint ventures, insurance company separate accounts for which the banking entity is a beneficiary provided the banking entity does not control investment decisions on the underlying assets or participate in the profits for the separate account except in accordance with supervisory guidance regarding bank owned life insurance, certain vehicles for loan and other permissible securitizations, small business investment companies, public welfare companies permitted under the National Bank Act, business development companies, registered investment companies and investment funds exempt from SEC registration under other statutory  provisions.  Investments in pooled trust preferred securities are permitted if acquired before December 10, 2013 and the banking entity reasonably believes that the trust preferred securities in the pool 
 
 23
 

were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets or by mutual holding companies.
 
The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in certain covered transactions, including loans and securities and asset purchases, with any covered fund for which it serves as investment manager, advisor or sponsor or that it organizes and offers.  Any transactions with a covered fund must be on terms as favorable to the banking entity as transactions with non-affiliates.  Finally, the Volcker Rule prohibits any otherwise permitted proprietary trading or covered fund activity that would involve a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its customers, result in a material exposure of the banking entity to high risk assets or trading strategies or would pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States.
 
EGRRCPA amends the definition of banking entity to exclude banks that do not have, and are not controlled by a company that has, more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and total trading assets that are more than 5% of total consolidated assets and the federal banking agencies have proposed to amend their implementing regulations to incorporate this exclusion.  Since the Bank qualifies for this exclusion, it will no longer be subject to the restrictions of the Volcker Rule.
