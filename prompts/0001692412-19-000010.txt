Item 1. Business.
Overview
Playa is a leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive resorts in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and/or managed a total portfolio consisting of 21 resorts (7,908 rooms) located in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Playa’s strategy is to leverage its globally recognized brand partnerships in order to capitalize on the gap between the 14% U.S. brand affiliated room supply in the regions in which we operate and the nearly 45% of visitors that come from the U.S. This strategy should drive outsized returns for our shareholders and enhance the lives of our associates and the communities in which we operate.
We believe that the resorts we own and manage are among the finest all-inclusive resorts in the markets they serve. We believe that our resorts have a competitive advantage due to their location, brand affiliations, extensive amenities, scale and design. Our portfolio is comprised of all-inclusive resorts that share some combination of the following characteristics:

• | Prime beachfront locations;


• | Globally recognized U.S. brand partners;


• | Convenient air access from a number of North American and other international gateway markets;


• | Strategic locations in popular vacation destinations in countries with strong government commitments to tourism;


• | High quality physical condition; and


• | Capacity for further revenues and earnings growth through incremental renovation or repositioning opportunities.

Our all-inclusive resorts provide guests an attractive vacation experience that offers both compelling value and price certainty, while at the same time providing Playa more predictable revenue, expense and occupancy rates than traditional full-service hotel business models. All-inclusive guests book and pay further in advance, resulting in lower cancellation rates and incremental sales of upgrades, premium services and amenities not included in the all-inclusive package pricing. 
We have strategic relationships with both Hyatt and Hilton, two of the preeminent globally recognized hotel brands. Hyatt’s and Hilton’s selection of Playa as its strategic partner in the development and management of all-inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America reflects their confidence and conviction in Playa’s best-in-class stewardship of all-inclusive resorts and provides us with unique advantages, including the following:

• | Access to worldwide reservation systems, global marketing scale, and approximately 100 million hotel loyalty members to drive revenue growth;


• | Higher propensity for guests to book direct, which results in significantly improved returns over bookings from online travel agents;


• | Lower customer acquisition costs, and higher net Average Daily Rates (ADRs);


• | Higher Net Asset value for branded hotels affiliated with global franchisors;


• | Lower cost of financing for properties affiliated with top tier brands;


• | Brand partners are a second set of eyes, focused on maximizing returns;


• | Immediate customer recognition for a new or converted resort;


• | Exposure to new consumers, who may not be familiar with the all-inclusive model;


• | Access to guests from different regions, creating a better segmentation mix, reducing the risk from an owner’s perspective;


• | Stronger marketing and public relations presence;


• | Brands are proven to reduce price sensitivity and encourage purchase decisions, resulting in higher revenues;


• | Branded resorts, on average, have higher occupancy than non-branded resorts;


• | Branded resorts have higher rates of group business; and


• | Branded resorts have lower failure rates.

We have also entered into an exclusive agreement with Panama Jack that provides us with the right to develop and own and/or manage all-inclusive resorts under the Panama Jack brand in certain regions. We also own and operate five resorts in Jamaica that we acquired from Sagicor in June 2018, four of which are operated under the Jewel brand. Other brands in our portfolio include: Dreams, Sanctuary, and Secrets. 
We consider each of our hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. For further discussion about our operating segments and financial information about the geographic regions in which we operate, please see Segment Results in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 19 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners, operators, developers and acquirers of all-inclusive resorts:

• | Premier Collection of All-Inclusive Resorts in Highly Desirable Locations. We believe that our portfolio represents a premier collection of all-inclusive resorts. Our award-winning resorts are located in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations, including Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos in Mexico, Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Montego Bay in Jamaica. Guests may conveniently access our resorts from a number of North American and other international gateway markets.


• | Diversified Portfolio of All-Inclusive Resorts. We currently offer our guests resorts located in four main geographic markets and across a number of price points. This diversity helps to foster loyalty among our guests and to drive repeat business. As of December 31, 2018, we operated resorts under eight brands. Having multiple brands to offer owners and developers is essential to our ability to secure management agreements and high-return acquisitions since having a family of brands mitigates the risks of brand-on-brand supply growth and subsequent cannibalization. 


• | Exclusive Focus on the All-Inclusive Model. We believe the all-inclusive resort model is increasing in popularity as more people come to appreciate the benefits of a high-quality vacation experience that couples value and a high degree of cost certainty. Because our guests have pre-purchased their vacation packages, we also have the opportunity to earn incremental revenue if our guests purchase upgrades, premium services and amenities that are not included in the all-inclusive package.


• | Integrated and Scalable Operating Platform. We believe we have developed a scalable resort management platform designed to improve operating efficiency at the 17 resorts we currently manage. Our platform enables us to integrate additional resorts we may acquire, manage hotels owned by third-parties and potentially internalize the management of the four resorts we own, but do not manage. Our platform also enables managers of each of our key functions, including sales, marketing and resort management, to observe, analyze, share and respond to trends throughout our portfolio. As a result, we are able to implement management initiatives on a real-time and portfolio-wide basis.


• | Strategic Relationship with Hyatt to Develop All-Inclusive Resorts. Our strategic relationship with Hyatt, which indirectly beneficially owned approximately 9.2% of our ordinary shares as of December 31, 2018, provides us with a range of benefits, including the right to operate certain of our existing resorts under the Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara brands (the “Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands”) in certain countries and, through December 31, 2021, certain rights with respect to the development and management of future Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands resorts in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Panama (the “Market Area”).

The Hyatt Ziva brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for all-ages and the Hyatt Zilara brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for adults-only. We believe these brands are currently Hyatt’s primary vehicle for all-inclusive resort growth and demonstrate Hyatt’s commitment to the all-inclusive model. The Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands have access to Hyatt’s low cost and high margin distribution channels, such as Hyatt guests using the World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program (which had approximately 16 million members as of December 31, 2018), Hyatt’s reservation system, Hyatt's mobile application and website and Hyatt’s extensive group sales business. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and the increasing awareness of our all-inclusive resort brands among potential guests will enable us to increase the number of bookings made through lower cost sales channels, such as direct bookings through Hyatt and our company and resort websites.

• | Strategic Relationship with Hilton to Develop All-Inclusive Resorts. Our newly-formed strategic alliance with Hilton affords us with the opportunity to leverage our management expertise and obtain access to Hilton's global portfolio of

7

brands and over 85 million Hilton Honors members as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, we successfully converted two of our resorts into three Hilton all-inclusive resorts, with the potential to convert, develop or manage up to an additional eight resorts in certain locations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South and Central America by 2025. Our strategic alliance with Hilton further diversifies our portfolio, enables us to reach more potential guests and greatly reduces our customer acquisition costs.

• | Experienced Leadership with a Proven Track Record. Our senior management team has significant experience in the lodging industry, including operating all-inclusive resorts.


– | Mr. Wardinski, our Chief Executive Officer has over 30 years of experience in the hospitality industry, founded our Predecessor and previously was the Chief Executive Officer of two lodging companies: Barceló Crestline Corporation, an independent hotel owner, lessee and manager; and Crestline Capital Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listed hotel owner, lessee and manager. Mr. Wardinski was also the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of Highland Hospitality Corporation, an NYSE-listed owner of upscale full-service, premium limited-service and extended-stay properties. Mr. Wardinski held other leadership roles within the industry including Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels and Resorts (NYSE: HST)) and various roles with Marriott International, Inc. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 1.9% of our outstanding ordinary shares are beneficially owned by Mr. Wardinski.


– | Mr. Stadlin, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer of our resort management company, has over 40 years of experience in the hospitality industry and was employed by Marriott International, Inc. for 33 years during which he spent 12 years working on its expansion into Latin America.


– | Mr. Froemming, our Chief Marketing Officer, has over 22 years of experience in the hospitality industry and spent 10 years as the sales and marketing leader of Sandals Resorts International, leading the growth of its two well-known all-inclusive brands, Sandals and Beaches.


– | Mr. Hymel, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 16 years of experience working within the hospitality sector. He previously served as Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Playa and has worked at hotel and resort owners and operators Barceló Crestline Corporation and Crestline Capital Corporation.

Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our goal is to be the leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive beachfront resorts in the markets we serve and to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns above our cost of capital and create value for our shareholders by implementing the following business and growth strategies:

• | Selectively Pursue Strategic Growth Opportunities. The all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry is highly fragmented. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our portfolio through acquisitions in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry, such as the recent acquisition of the Sagicor Assets. We believe that our extensive experience in all-inclusive resort operations, brand relationships, acquisition, expansion, renovation, repositioning and rebranding, established and scalable management platform and ability to offer NASDAQ-listed ordinary shares to potential resort sellers will make us a preferred asset acquirer.


• | Secure New Management Agreements. We intend to pursue opportunities to capitalize on our scalable and integrated resort management platform and our expertise and experience with managing all-inclusive resorts, by seeking to manage all-inclusive resorts owned by third parties for a fee and to potentially, over time, internalize the management of resorts we own that are currently managed by a third-party. For example, in September 2017, we entered into a long-term agreement to manage the 323-room Sanctuary Resort in Cap Cana, and in June 2018, we secured a long-term agreement to manage 129 rooms at the Jewel Grande Montego Bay Resort & Spa.


• | Utilization of New Technologies and Leverage of Big Data. We utilize numerous technologies aimed at improving guest satisfaction and shareholder returns. During 2018, we launched a new website using a new search engine and metasearch optimization tools aimed at driving direct bookings, our lowest cost customer acquisition channel. As a result, our percentage of direct bookings increased from 18.2% in 2017 to 21.6% in 2018. With the implementation of our new booking engine and digital initiatives during the second half of 2018, we are seeing strong growth in 2019.

We also recently launched a new end-to-end technology at select resorts which uses sophisticated algorithms to identify in real-time what upgrades, packages and pricing to offer guests. This enables us to provide guests with several options 
8

to enhance their experience, while increasing revenue post-booking. Other new technological innovations underway include our recently launched travel agent portal, which facilitates travel agent bookings without the additional commission layer of a tour and travel operator, as well as the upcoming launch of our new yield management system, which should maximize guest revenues by optimizing both package rates and channel mix. 
Additionally, by virtue of our partnerships with Hyatt and Hilton, we have greatly increased our access to member data and analytics with respect to millions of guests, further enabling us to drive lower customer acquisition costs, bookings and revenues. 
Playa’s Hyatt Resort Agreements
For each Playa resort using a Hyatt All-Inclusive Brand, the Hyatt franchise agreements (the “Hyatt Resort Agreements”) grant to each of Playa and any third party owner for whom Playa serves as hotel operator (each a “Resort Owner”) the right, and such Resort Owner undertakes the obligation, to use Hyatt’s hotel system and system standards to build or convert and operate the resort subject to the agreement. Each franchise agreement between Hyatt and such Resort Owner has an initial 15-year term and Hyatt has two options to extend the term for an additional term of five years each or 10 years in the aggregate. Hyatt provides initial and ongoing training and guidance, marketing assistance and other assistance to each Resort Owner (and Playa as the resort’s manager) in connection with the resort’s development and operation. As part of this assistance, Hyatt reviews and approves the initial design and related elements of the resort. Hyatt also arranges for the provision of certain mandatory services, as well as (at the Resort Owner’s option) certain non-mandatory services, relating to the resort’s development and operation. In return, each Resort Owner agrees to operate the resort according to Hyatt’s operating procedures and its brand, quality assurance and other standards and specifications. This includes complying with Hyatt’s requirements relating to the central reservation system, global distribution systems and alternative distribution systems. In addition to the Hyatt franchise agreement, each Hyatt franchise Resort Owner enters into additional agreements with Hyatt pertaining to the development and operation of such new Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resort, including a trademark sublicense agreement, a World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program agreement, a chain marketing services agreement and a reservations agreement.
We continue to work with Hyatt to jointly improve all aspects of the brand system and standards for the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands. Hyatt owns the intellectual property rights relating to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands, but we will have rights to use certain innovations that Hyatt and Playa jointly developed for the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands.
The Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement
We have entered into the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement (with “Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement”) with Hyatt pursuant to which Playa and Hyatt have provided each other a right of first offer through December 31, 2021, with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement to acquire the rights to own and operating an all-inclusive resort at the level of quality and service consistent with the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands (a “Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity”) in the Market Area. If Playa intends to accept a Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Playa must notify Hyatt of such Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity and Hyatt has 10 business days to notify Playa of its decision to either accept or reject this Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity. If Hyatt accepts the Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Playa must negotiate in good faith with Hyatt the terms of a franchise agreement and related documents with respect to such property, provided that Playa acquires such property on terms acceptable to Playa within 60 days of offering such opportunity to Hyatt. If Hyatt intends to accept a Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Hyatt must notify Playa and Playa has to notify Hyatt within 10 business days of its decision to either accept or reject this Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity. If Playa accepts the Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Hyatt must negotiate in good faith with Playa the terms of a management agreement and other documents under which Playa would manage such Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resort (subject to a franchise agreement between Hyatt and the affiliate of Hyatt that would own such property), provided that Hyatt acquires such property on terms acceptable to it within 60 days of offering such opportunity to Playa. If Playa or Hyatt fails to notify each other of its decision or declines its right of first offer within the aforementioned 10 business day period, or if Playa or Hyatt determine after good-faith discussions that we cannot reach mutual acceptance of terms under which the development property would be licensed as a Hyatt Ziva or Hyatt Zilara hotel, such right of first offer will expire and Playa or Hyatt will be able to acquire, develop and operate the property related to such Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity free of any restrictions. In addition, if either party is approached by a third party with respect to the management or franchising, as applicable, of an all-inclusive resort in the Market Area, and such third party has not identified a manager or franchisor, as applicable, for the resort, the parties will notify each other and provide an introduction to the third party for the purposes of negotiating a management agreement or franchise agreement, in the case of Hyatt. On February 26, 2018, we and Hyatt extended the term of the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement until December 31, 2021.

The Hilton Strategic Alliance Agreement
We have entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Hilton pursuant to which Hilton has granted to Playa, a right of first offer in the event that Hilton receives a letter of intent from a third party to franchise or manage a hotel under the Hilton all-inclusive Resort brand (the “Brand”), within certain countries located in the Caribbean (the “Caribbean Target Markets”) and Mexico, and certain countries in Central and South America (the “Mexico, Central and South America Target Markets” and collectively with the Caribbean Target Markets, the “Target Markets”) (collectively, the “Area of Exclusivity”). Upon receipt of any such third-party offer, Hilton shall notify Playa and we will have a period of 150 days from the date of such notice, to submit an application to Hilton to franchise a hotel in such country under the Brand. If we choose to submit a franchise application to Hilton, then we agree not to propose, negotiate, hold discussions or enter into any agreement with a third party to operate, or authorize the operating of a non-Hilton brand hotel in the country under consideration, until such time as Hilton has approved or denied our franchise application or we have informed Hilton of our desire not to pursue an application for franchise. In order to maintain our right of first offer in the Area of Exclusivity, we have agreed to open a total of eight additional Hilton all-inclusive Brand resorts, consisting of at least four hotels in the Caribbean Target Market (the “Caribbean Development Obligation”) and at least four hotels within the Mexico, Central and South America Target Market (the “Mexico, Central and South America Development Obligation”), under the Brand, no later than December 31, 2024 (provided that the last hotel in each market may open in 2025). In each case, the number of rooms in any proposed hotel must exceed 350. Additionally, we have agreed to certain development milestones (“Development Milestones”) in each of the Target Markets, including opening one hotel under the Brand during each calendar year commencing 2021. In November 2018, by virtue of Playa converting THE Royal Playa del Carmen to the Hilton Playa del Carmen All-Inclusive Resort and the Dreams La Romana to the Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Family Resort and the Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Adult Resort, we successfully satisfied our Development Milestones through 2021 in each of the Target Markets.
Hilton Franchise Agreements
In connection with our strategic alliance with Hilton, we have entered into franchise agreements with Hilton pursuant to which Hilton has granted to each of Playa and any third-party owner for whom Playa serves as hotel operator the right to operate such hotels under the Brand. These franchise agreements have an initial term of 15 years, unless sooner terminated in accordance with their terms. The agreements also contain customary terms with respect to how we market and operate the hotel under the Brand and impose a number of requirements including, among others, that we comply with Hilton’s standards in connection with the design, construction, refurbishing and operating of our Hilton branded hotels. 
AMResorts Management Agreements
Four of our resorts (Dreams Puerto Aventuras, Secrets Capri, Dreams Punta Cana and Dreams Palm Beach) are operated by AMResorts pursuant to management agreements that contain customary terms and conditions, including those related to fees, termination conditions, capital expenditures, transfers of control of parties or transfers of ownership to competitors, sales of the hotels and non-competition and non-solicitation. These agreements are scheduled to expire in 2022. We pay AMResorts and its affiliates, as operators of these resorts, base management fees and incentive management fees. In addition, we reimburse the operators for some of the costs they incur in the provision of certain centralized services. We may also choose to opportunistically sell one or more of these resorts and redeploy the proceeds from any such sales, subject to certain restrictions under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below). 
The Panama Jack Agreement
We entered into a master development agreement (the “Panama Jack Agreement”) with Panama Jack in 2017. Pursuant to the Panama Jack Agreement, Panama Jack has granted us, subject to our compliance with certain development milestones, the exclusive right to develop and own and/or to manage resorts under the Panama Jack brand (the “Panama Jack Resorts”) in Antigua, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, St. Lucia and, subject to the lifting of various U.S. sanctions, Cuba. In addition, if Playa wishes to participate in any project to develop, convert or operate any resorts in the aforementioned countries that we believe in good faith and reasonable judgment are suitable for branding or conversion as a Panama Jack Resort, we will submit an application to Panama Jack to operate such resort as a Panama Jack Resort pursuant to the terms of the Panama Jack Agreement. Panama Jack may, in its commercially reasonable discretion, decide to approve or reject our application to operate a Panama Jack Resort. If Panama Jack approves our application, each such approved resort will be subject to a separate license agreement with Panama Jack. The Panama Jack Agreement has a 10 year term expiring in 2026, subject to either party's right to terminate in certain circumstances. 
We rebranded and re-opened two of our existing resorts, Gran Caribe Resort and Gran Porto Resort, under the Panama Jack brand in December 2017.

Vacation Package Distribution Channels and Sales and Reservations
Our experienced sales and marketing team uses a strategic sales and marketing program across a variety of distribution channels through which our all-inclusive vacation packages are sold. Key components of this sales and marketing program include:

• | Targeting the primary tour operators and the wholesale market for transient business with a scalable program that supports shoulder and lower rate seasons while seeking to maximize revenue during high season, which also includes:


• | Engaging in cooperative marketing programs with leading travel industry participants;


• | Participating in travel agent tour operator promotional campaigns; and


• | Utilizing online travel leaders, such as Expedia and Booking.com, to supplement sales during shoulder and lower rate seasons;


• | Developing programs aimed at targeting consumers directly through:


• | Our company and resort websites;


• | The Hyatt website and toll free reservation telephone numbers;


• | The World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program;


• | The Hilton website and toll free reservation system;


• | The Hilton Honors guest loyalty program; and


• | Our toll free reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory in real time, based on demand;


• | Targeting group and incentive markets to seek and grow a strong base of corporate and event business;


• | Highlighting destination wedding and honeymoon programs;


• | Participating in key industry trade shows targeted to the travel agent and wholesale market;


• | Engaging in online and social media, including:


• | Search engine optimization;


• | Targeted online and bounce-back advertising;


• | Social media presence via sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest; and


• | Flash sales and special offers for high need periods;


• | Monitoring and managing TripAdvisor and other similar consumer sites; and


• | Activating a targeted public relations plan to generate media attention-both traditional and new media including travel bloggers who focus on vacation travel to Mexico and the Caribbean.

We also seek luxury transient business to provide high rate business during peak seasons, such as winter and spring holidays, while “bargain hunters” can be targeted through social media for last minute high need periods. This multi-pronged strategy is designed to increase Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) as well as generate strong occupancy through all of the resort seasons.
Insurance
Our resorts carry what we believe are appropriate levels of insurance coverage for a business operating in the lodging industry in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. This insurance includes coverage for general liability, property, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business and business interruption coverage.
This general liability insurance provides coverage for any claim, including terrorism and hurricane damage, resulting from our operations, goods and services and vehicles. We believe these insurance policies are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers.
11

Competition
We face intense competition for guests from other participants in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry and, to a lesser extent, from traditional hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. The all-inclusive segment remains a relatively small part of the broadly defined global vacation market that has historically been dominated by hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. Our principal competitors include other operators of all-inclusive resorts and resort companies, such as Barceló Hotels & Resorts, RIU Hotels & Resorts, IBEROSTAR Hotels & Resorts, Karisma Hotels & Resorts, AMResorts, Meliá Hotels International, Excellence Resorts and Palace Resorts, as well as some smaller, independent and local owners and operators. We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities and quality of accommodations. 
In addition, we also compete for guests based on the ability of hotel loyalty program members to earn and redeem loyalty program points at our Hyatt and Hilton all-inclusive resorts. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and Hilton, two globally recognized hotel brand leaders, provides us with a significant competitive advantage. 
Seasonality
The seasonality of the lodging industry and the location of our resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean generally result in the greatest demand for our resorts between mid-December and April of each year, yielding higher occupancy levels and package rates during this period. This seasonality in demand has resulted in predictable fluctuations in revenue, results of operations and liquidity, which are consistently higher during the first quarter of each year than in successive quarters.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is highly cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in operating performance are caused largely by general economic and local market conditions, which subsequently affect levels of business and leisure travel. In addition to general economic conditions, new hotel and resort room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance, and over-building has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic recession. Room rates and occupancy, and thus Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A decline in lodging demand, or increase in lodging supply, could result in returns that are substantially below expectations, or result in losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, many of the costs of running a resort are fixed rather than variable. As a result, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings is likely to be higher than the rate of decline in revenues.
Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks or trade names that we use or will use in conjunction with the operation of our business, including certain of Hyatt’s and Hilton’s intellectual property under the Hyatt Resort Agreements and our franchise agreements with Hilton. We also have rights to certain of Panama Jack’s intellectual property under the Panama Jack Agreement and related agreements. In the highly competitive lodging industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important to the success of our business.
