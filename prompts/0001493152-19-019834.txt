On March 23, 2018, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Kinetic Development Inc., an Ontario, Canada Corporation (“KDI”). The subsidiary was incorporated to facilitate payroll transactions for the employees. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and for the Period from June 6, 2014 (Inception) through September 30, 2019. KDI is included as of September 30, 2018 and for the period from March 23, 2018 (date of formation) through September 30, 2019. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Kinetic Group Inc. is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Although the Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All losses accumulated since Inception (June 6, 2014) have been considered as part of the Company’s development stage activities.
 
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.
 
The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage.
 
For public business entities, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Kinetic Group has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the company to remove the inception to date information and all references to development stage.
 
Our Digital Marketing Services
 
We offer a wide variety of integrated digital marketing services to our clients. Our services include web design and development, organic search engine optimization (Organic SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) management, content creation and marketing, e-mail marketing and social media marketing.
Web Design and Development.
 
We offer custom website design services, whether it is front-end design, or a full end-to-end web development project.

Organic Search Engine Optimization (Organic SEO). 
 Search results for websites that use organic SEO will grow, expand, and adapt over time in response to readers’ desires. Although black hat SEO methods, such as hidden text, cloaking, and blog comment spam, may boost a website’s search engine page rank in the short term, these methods could also get the site banned from the search engines altogether.

Pay-Per-Click (PPC) management.
 
Pay-per-click (PPC), also known as cost-per-click (CPC), is an internet advertising model used to direct traffic to websites, in which an advertiser pays a publisher (typically a website owner or a network of websites) whenever the ad is clicked on. Search engines, such as Google and Bing, allow businesses and individuals to buy listings in their search results. These listings appear above the non-paid organic search results. The search engine is then paid every time a user clicks on the sponsored listing.
 
Pay-per-click advertising can generate traffic right away. It is a simple strategy: spend enough on PPC advertisement and get top placement when people execute relevant searches. Potential customers will see the business first when executing a relevant search as it will appear at the top of the search results page. However, PPC advertising can run up costs extremely quickly. It is easy to get caught up in a bidding war over a particular keyword and end up spending far more than your potential return. ‘Ego-based’ bidding, where a business or a marketing agency decides they must be at the top of the results may cause the client to spend too much money. Another concern with PPC is that there is constant bid inflation, which raises the per-click cost for highly-searched phrases.
 
If a client has a short-term campaign for a new product, service, or special issue, pay-per-click can be a great way to generate buzz quickly. We can start a pay-per-click campaign within 24-48 hours, and the client can generally change the text of the advertisement at any time, allowing the client to adjust the advertisement’s message easily. If the client needs to bring potential customer attention to a new product or service for a finite amount of time, PPC is one effective way to achieve this goal.
 
Social Media and Blogs
 
We help our clients build their customer base by helping them cultivate a strong online presence. Corporate blogs allow brands to engage with existing and potential customers, to improve their search engine rankings and to create a community of posters through the comments section. Currently, our directors provide blog design services. In addition, when a short-term project requires a specific set of skills, we engage freelance designers through online talent recruitment tools, such as www.upwork.com and LinkedIn. We also use freelance researchers, bloggers, and writers to research relevant news and information about our clients, industries and businesses. Our freelance writers create blog posts, tweets, and news comments that are posted on relevant social media and news websites. We customize the design, content and message to appeal to the target audience for our clients’ brand. Our social media services include:

Currently, we have limited workforce and financial resources and are not able to take on labor-intensive projects. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to attract new customers and expand our operations. Failure to achieve a sustainable sales level will cause us to go out of business.

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
Other than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. We do not currently plan to spend any funds on research and development activities in the future.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We are not aware of any environmental laws that have been enacted, nor are we aware of any such laws being contemplated for the future, that impact issues specific to our business.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019 we had four employees including our officers and directors. Our officers and directors are responsible for planning, developing and operational duties, and will continue to do so throughout the early stages of our growth.

We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.
