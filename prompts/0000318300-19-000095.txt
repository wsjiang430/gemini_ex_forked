ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Corporate Overview
Peoples Bancorp Inc. is a financial holding company, which was organized in 1980. Peoples operates principally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Peoples Bank, an Ohio state-chartered bank. Peoples' other wholly-owned subsidiary is Peoples Investment Company ("PIC"), Peoples also holds all of the common securities of NB&T Statutory Trust III. Peoples Bank's operating subsidiaries include Peoples Insurance Agency, LLC ("Peoples Insurance") and an asset management company, Peoples Tax Credit Equity, LLC.
Peoples Bank was first chartered in 1902 as an Ohio banking corporation under the name "The Peoples Banking and Trust Company" in Marietta, Ohio, and in 2000 was reorganized as a national banking association under the name "Peoples Bank, National Association." Effective December 30, 2015, the banking subsidiary converted from a national banking association back to an Ohio state-chartered bank, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a result of the charter conversion, the legal name of Peoples' banking subsidiary was changed to "Peoples Bank" and the converted bank continues to operate under the trade name and federally registered service mark "Peoples Bank." Peoples Insurance is an Ohio limited liability company that operates as a subsidiary of Peoples Bank.
 PIC was formed in 2001 and Peoples Tax Credit Equity, LLC was formed in 2014, in each case to provide new investment opportunities as a means of enhancing profitability. The common securities of NB&T Statutory Trust III were acquired in connection with the acquisition of NB&T Financial Group, Inc. ("NB&T") on March 6, 2015.

Peoples has a history of expanding its business, including its customer base and primary market area, through a combination of internal growth and targeted acquisitions. The internal growth may include the opening of de novo
 4

banking and loan production offices located in or near Peoples' existing market area. Acquisitions have consisted of traditional banking offices and loan production offices, both individually and as part of entire financial institutions, insurance agencies and financial advisory books of business. The primary objectives of Peoples' expansion efforts include: (1) providing opportunities to integrate non-traditional products and services, such as insurance and investment administration and management, with the traditional banking products offered to its clients; (2) increasing market share in existing markets; (3) expanding Peoples' core financial service businesses of banking, insurance and investment and investment management; and (4) improving operating efficiency by directing resources toward offices and markets with the greatest earnings opportunities.
Recent Corporate Developments 
On October 29, 2018, Peoples entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "First Prestonsburg Merger Agreement") with First Prestonsburg Bancshares Inc. ("First Prestonsburg"), which calls for First Prestonsburg to merge into Peoples. First Prestonsburg is the parent company of The First Commonwealth Bank of Prestonsburg, Inc. ("First Commonwealth"), which operates nine full-service branches located in eastern Kentucky. Following the merger of First Prestonsburg into Peoples, First Commonwealth will merge into Peoples Bank. This transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As of December 31, 2018, First Prestonsburg had approximately $308.5 million in total assets, which included approximately $140.1 million in total loans, and approximately $236.6 million in total deposits. Under the terms of the First Prestonsburg Merger Agreement, shareholders of First Prestonsburg will be entitled to receive 12.512 Peoples common shares for each First Prestonsburg share of common stock they own at the effective time of the merger. In addition, immediately prior to the closing of the merger, First Prestonsburg will pay a special cash distribution of $140.30 per share to its shareholders.
On April 13, 2018, Peoples completed the acquisition of ASB Financial Corp. ("ASB"). ASB merged into Peoples, and ASB's wholly-owned subsidiary, American Savings Bank, fsb, which operated seven full-service bank branches and two loan production offices in southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky, merged into Peoples Bank. Under the terms of the merger agreement with ASB, Peoples paid total consideration of $41.5 million. The ASB acquisition added $239.2 million of loans, net of deferred fees and costs, and loans held for sale in the aggregate, and $198.6 million of total deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments.
Refer to Note 19 Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Primary Market Area and Customers
Peoples considers its primary market area to be comprised of those counties where it has a physical branch presence and their contiguous counties. This includes northeastern, central, southwestern and southeastern Ohio, west central West Virginia and eastern Kentucky. Peoples currently operates 62 locations in Ohio, 13 locations in West Virginia and 6 locations in Kentucky. Peoples' market area consists of rural, small urban and metropolitan markets and serves a diverse group of industries and employers. Principal industries served in Peoples' primary markets include manufacturing, distribution, real estate, health care, education, municipal, agricultural, petrochemical, oil, gas and coal production, wholesale and retail trade, tourism, and service-related industries. This broad-based economy provides diversity, which helps prevent Peoples' revenue and earnings from being largely dependent upon any single industry segment.
Lending Activities
Peoples Bank originates various types of loans, including commercial loans (comprised of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial real estate construction loans), residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, consumer loans (comprised of both indirect and direct loans) and Overdraft Privilege.  Peoples Bank's lending activities are focused principally on lending opportunities within its primary market areas, although Peoples Bank may occasionally originate loans outside its primary markets.  In general, Peoples Bank retains the majority of loans it originates; however, certain longer-term fixed rate mortgage loan originations, primarily one-to-four family residential mortgages, and portions of select commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are sold into the secondary market or to other financial institutions.
Peoples Bank's loans consist of credit extensions to borrowers spread over a broad range of industrial classifications. At December 31, 2018, Peoples Bank had no concentration of loans to borrowers engaged in the same or similar industries that exceeded 10% of total loans (also referred to as "loans, net of deferred fees and costs"), nor did it have any loans outstanding to non-United States ("U.S.") entities.
Commercial Lending
Commercial loans include commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial real estate construction loans, and represented the largest portion of Peoples Bank's total loan portfolio, comprising approximately 55.7% and 57.2% of total loans at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
 5

Commercial lending inherently involves a significant degree of risk of loss since commercial loan relationships generally involve larger loan balances than other loan classes.
Commercial loan terms include amortization schedules and interest rates commensurate with the purpose of each loan, the identified source of repayment, and the risk involved. The majority of Peoples Bank's commercial loans carry variable interest rates equal to an underlying index rate plus a margin, although Peoples Bank also originates commercial loans with fixed interest rates for periods generally ranging from three to ten years. At December 31, 2018, the commercial loan portfolio consisted of 76.2% in variable interest rate loans and 23.8% in fixed interest rate loans. In determining whether to grant a commercial loan, Peoples Bank primarily reviews a schedule of cash flows to evaluate whether the borrower's anticipated future cash flows will be adequate to service both interest and principal due.
Peoples Bank also originates variable rate loans with interest rate swaps, where the customer enters into an interest rate swap with Peoples Bank on terms that match the terms of the loan. By entering into the interest rate swap with the customer, Peoples Bank effectively provides the customer with a fixed rate loan while creating a variable rate asset for Peoples Bank. Peoples Bank offsets its exposure in the swap by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an unaffiliated institution. These interest rate swaps do not qualify as designated hedges; therefore, each swap is accounted for as a standalone derivative.
Peoples Bank evaluates all commercial loan relationships whose aggregate credit exposure is greater than $1.0 million on an annual basis for possible credit deterioration. This loan review process provides Peoples Bank with opportunities to identify potential problem loans and take proactive actions to assure repayment of the loan or minimize Peoples Bank's risk of loss, such as reviewing the relationship more frequently based upon the loan quality rating and aggregate outstanding exposure. Upon detection of the reduced ability of a borrower to meet cash flow obligations, the loan is reviewed for possible downgrade in the loan quality rating or placement on nonaccrual status. Peoples Bank also completes evaluation procedures for a selection of larger loan relationships on a quarterly basis. Loan relationships whose aggregate credit exposure to Peoples Bank is equal to or less than $1.0 million are reviewed on an event driven basis. Triggers for review include a borrower's request to renew a maturing loan or line of credit, knowledge of adverse events affecting the borrower's business, receipt of financial statements indicating deteriorating credit quality, or other similar events.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
Commercial and industrial loans are loans to operating companies for purposes of financing working capital needs, fixed asset acquisitions, acquisitions of other businesses, and other business activities. Typically, these loans are secured with business assets and, in some cases, owner-occupied real estate, and personally guaranteed by the owners of the operating companies. The primary source of repayment of this type of loan is generally cash flows generated from operations of the business, which can be susceptible to adverse changes in economic conditions of the general economy as a whole or within a specific industry.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
Peoples Bank originates commercial real estate loans which are typically secured by stabilized real estate, which can be owner-occupied commercial real estate or non-owner-occupied investment commercial real estate, and personally guaranteed by the owners of the borrowing entities. Typically, owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. The source of repayment of this type of loan is typically cash flow from the operating company occupying the real estate. Investment commercial real estate generally includes office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. Typically, the primary source of repayment of this type of loan is rental income generated from leasing activities.
Commercial Real Estate Construction Loans
Peoples Bank originates construction loans to provide temporary financing during the construction phase for commercial and residential properties. Peoples Bank's construction lending is focused primarily on commercial and residential projects of select real estate developers and homebuilders. These projects include the construction of apartment, office, retail, and industrial complexes and other commercial and residential projects. The underwriting criteria for construction loans are generally the same as for non-construction loans.
Construction financing is generally considered to involve higher credit risk since Peoples Bank is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at the completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimated construction cost proves to be inaccurate, Peoples Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to enable completion of the project. 
 6

If the estimate of value proves inaccurate, Peoples Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a property having a value insufficient to ensure full repayment, should the borrower default. In the event a default on a construction loan occurs and foreclosure follows, Peoples Bank must take control of the project and attempt to either arrange for completion of construction or sell the collateral of the unfinished project. In certain cases, such as real estate development projects, repayment of construction loans occurs as a result of subsequent sales of the developed real estate. Additional risk exists as the developer may lack funds to repay the loan if the property is not sold upon completion.
To mitigate the risk of construction lending, Peoples Bank requires periodic site inspections, typically completed by an independent third party, to ensure appropriate completion of the project prior to any disbursements. Construction loans are structured to provide sufficient time to complete construction, giving consideration to weather or other variables that influence completion time. In general, Peoples Bank typically requires the term of its construction loans to be less than three years.
Residential Real Estate Loans
While commercial loans comprise the largest portion of Peoples Bank's loan portfolio, residential real estate lending remains a major focus of Peoples Bank. The residential real estate loans originated by Peoples Bank may either be retained in its loan portfolio, or sold into the secondary market with servicing either retained by Peoples Bank or sold with the loan. Peoples Bank's portfolio of residential real estate loans comprised 21.8% of total loans at December 31, 2018, and 20.8% at December 31, 2017. Peoples Bank also had $5.5 million of residential real estate loans held for sale and was servicing $461.3 million of loans, consisting primarily of one-to-four family residential mortgages, which had previously been sold into the secondary market, in each case, as of December 31, 2018. Peoples Bank also originates and retains jumbo residential mortgage loans for primary and secondary residences, which are nonconforming loans that are higher than the loan amounts acceptable for sale to the government-sponsored enterprises to which Peoples Bank typically sells residential mortgage loans.
Peoples Bank originates both fixed rate and variable rate residential real estate loans. Typically, Peoples Bank sells its longer-term fixed rate real estate loans into the secondary market. In select cases, Peoples Bank may retain certain fixed rate real estate loans.
Peoples Bank typically requires residential real estate loan amounts to be no more than 80% of the purchase price or the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, whichever is lower, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained by the borrower for the percentage exceeding 80%. In limited circumstances, Peoples Bank may lend up to 100% of the appraised value of the real estate, although such lending currently is limited to loans that qualify under established federally-backed rural housing programs or through a designated low-to-moderate income loan program. Numerous risk factors attributable to real estate lending are considered during underwriting for the purposes of establishing an interest rate commensurate with the inherent risks of the loan.
Real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages with evidence of title in favor of Peoples Bank in the form of an attorney's opinion of the title or a title insurance policy. Peoples Bank requires insurance, with Peoples Bank named as the mortgagee and loss payee. Peoples Bank requires evidence of insurance at the time of the loan closing. Additionally, Peoples Bank has a blanket insurance policy to cover loans secured by real estate with outstanding balances of less than $1 million that do not include an insurance escrow account. For loans secured by real estate with outstanding balances over $1 million or those that include an insurance escrow account, Peoples Bank force-places an insurance policy to cover residential real estate loans when the borrower fails to maintain adequate insurance. Licensed appraisals are required for all real estate loans, and are completed by an independent third party.
Home Equity Lines of Credit
Peoples Bank originates home equity lines of credit that provide consumers with greater flexibility in financing personal expenditures. At December 31, 2018, outstanding home equity lines of credit comprised 4.9% of Peoples Bank's total loans, compared to 4.6% at December 31, 2017. Peoples Bank currently offers home equity lines of credit with a prime-based variable rate for the entire 10-year term of the loan and fixed rate installment loans with 5 to 15-year terms. Peoples Bank also offers a home equity line of credit whose terms include a fixed rate for the first five years, which converts to a variable interest rate for the remaining five years. At December 31, 2018, Peoples Bank's home equity loan portfolio consisted of 95.6% in variable interest rate loans and 4.4% in fixed interest rate loans. At December 31, 2018, 16.0% of the total home equity loan portfolio was convertible rate home equity lines of credit, with total outstanding principal balances and available credit amounts of $21.4 million and $22.1 million, respectively, and a weighted-average remaining maturity was 7.3 years. The average original loan amount under these convertible rate home equity lines of credit was $37,000 at December 31, 2018.
Home equity lines of credit are generally made as second mortgages by Peoples Bank. The maximum amount of a home equity line of credit is generally limited to 80% of the appraised value of the property less the balance of the 
 7

first mortgage. Peoples Bank may lend up to 90% of the appraised value of the property (less the balance of the first mortgage) at higher interest rates that are commensurate with the additional risk being assumed in these situations. The home equity lines of credit are written with 10-year terms and are subject to underwriting review upon request for renewal.
Consumer Lending
Peoples Bank's consumer lending activities include consumer indirect loans and consumer direct loans, which primarily involve loans secured by automobiles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and other personal property, as well as unsecured loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans generally involve more risk as to collectability than real estate mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral or, in certain instances, the absence of collateral. As a result, consumer lending collections are dependent upon the borrower's continued financial stability, and are at more risk from adverse changes in personal circumstances. In addition, application of various state and federal laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, could limit the amount that may be recovered under these loans. Credit approval for consumer loans typically requires demonstration of sufficiency of income to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, an established credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. It is the policy of Peoples Bank to review its consumer loan portfolio monthly and to charge-off loans that do not meet its ongoing standards, while strictly adhering to all laws and regulations governing consumer lending. A qualified compliance officer is responsible for monitoring regulatory compliance performance and for advising and updating loan personnel.
Consumer Indirect Loans
Peoples Bank originates consumer indirect loans through select dealerships, which generally includes loans secured by automobiles, motorcycles and recreational vehicles. At December 31, 2018, consumer indirect loans comprised 14.9% of Peoples Bank's total loan portfolio compared to 14.5% at December 31, 2017. 
Consumer indirect loans are originated at the point of sale, or dealership, and are subject to the same pricing structure and underwriting process as other consumer loans. Consumer indirect lending offers Peoples Bank the opportunity to access additional customers outside of its primary office locations. Peoples Bank offers consumer indirect lending through approved dealerships, including franchise dealerships or independent dealerships, which specialize in new or late-model inventory. These dealerships undergo an approval process whereby Peoples Bank reviews the dealership licensing and industry experience, evaluates customer experience with the dealership and completes an inspection of the inventory, showroom, and general facilities. On an ongoing basis, the dealerships are monitored based on monthly production volume, application approval rates and portfolio default rates.
Consumer Direct Loans
Peoples Bank originates consumer direct loans primarily through its office locations. Consumer direct loans generally include loans secured by automobiles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and other personal property, as well as unsecured loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer direct loans differ from consumer indirect loans as they include expanded products, such as loans secured by stock or deposits, or unsecured loans. At December 31, 2018, consumer direct loans comprised 2.7% of Peoples Bank's total loan portfolio compared to 2.9% at December 31, 2017. 
Overdraft Privilege 
Peoples Bank grants Overdraft Privilege to qualified customers. Overdraft Privilege is a service that provides overdraft protection to deposit customers, both individual and business, by establishing an Overdraft Privilege amount. After a 60-day waiting period to verify account activity, each new checking account usually receives an Overdraft Privilege amount of $400, $700 or $1,000 based on the type of account and other parameters, such as previous charge-off history or loan loss. Once established, customers are permitted to overdraw their checking account at Peoples Bank's discretion, up to their Overdraft Privilege limit, with each item being charged Peoples Bank's regular overdraft fee, with a maximum of seven charges per day when the customer's account is overdrawn more than $5. Customers repay the overdraft with their next deposit. Overdraft Privilege is designed to allow Peoples Bank to fill the void between traditional overdraft protection, such as a line of credit, and "check cashing stores." Under federal banking regulations, Peoples Bank is required to obtain the consent of its customers in order to apply Overdraft Privilege to ATM and one-time debit card transactions. While Overdraft Privilege generates fee income, these fees may be offset by loan loss provisioning necessary to ensure the maintenance of an appropriate allowance for losses against overdrafts deemed uncollectable. This allowance, along with the related provision and net charge-offs, was included in Peoples Bank's allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2018, the unfunded commitment related to Overdraft Privilege was $47.8 million.

Investment Activities
At December 31, 2018, investment securities comprised 21.8% of Peoples' total assets, compared to 24.4% at December 31, 2017. The majority of Peoples' investment activities are conducted through Peoples Bank, although Peoples Bancorp Inc. and its non-banking subsidiary, PIC, also may engage in investment activities from time to time. Investment activity by Peoples Bank is subject to certain regulatory guidelines and limitations on the types of securities eligible for purchase. As a result, the investment securities owned by Peoples Bank at December 31, 2018 included agencies and corporations of the U.S. government, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision in the U.S. and bank eligible corporate obligations, including private-label mortgage-backed securities. Peoples Bank also invests in tax credit funds. The investments owned by Peoples Bancorp Inc. are comprised of common stocks issued by unrelated bank holding companies. The investments owned by PIC consist of tax credit funds, municipal obligations and privately issued mortgage-backed securities.
Peoples Bank's investment activities are governed internally by a policy approved by the Board of Directors, which is administered by Peoples Bank's Asset-Liability Management Committee ("ALCO"). The primary purpose of Peoples Bank's investment portfolio is to: (1) employ excess funds not needed to support loan demand; (2) provide a source of liquid assets to accommodate unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, and overall liquidity needs; (3) provide eligible securities to secure public and trust funds; and (4) earn the maximum overall return commensurate with Peoples Bank's risk appetite and liquidity needs. Investment strategies to achieve these objectives are reviewed and approved by the ALCO. In its evaluation of investment strategies, the ALCO considers various factors, including the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and Peoples Bank's overall interest rate sensitivity. The ALCO also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the "Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity" section of "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" of this Form 10-K.
Funding Sources
Peoples' primary sources of funds for lending and investing activities are interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Cash flows from both the loan and investment portfolios, which include scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, calls and maturities, also provide a relatively stable source of funds. Peoples also utilizes a variety of short-term and long-term borrowings to fund asset growth and satisfy liquidity needs. Peoples' funding sources are managed through Peoples' asset-liability management process and monitored by the ALCO which is discussed further in the "Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity" section of "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" of this Form 10-K. 
The following is a brief description of the various sources of funds utilized by Peoples: 
Deposits
Peoples Bank obtains deposits principally from individuals and businesses within its primary market area by offering a broad selection of deposit products to clients. Deposits to individuals have account terms that vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time the funds must remain on deposit, and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (1) the interest rates offered by competitors, (2) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (3) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (4) the anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Business deposits, which include traditional commercial business as well as governmental entities, are obtained through an offering of multiple deposit account types as well as cash management solutions. Depending on the need of the entity, these deposits could be either interest or non-interest bearing. With the ability to offer competitive cash management solutions to its customers, it enables Peoples Bank to obtain valuable operating account funds as well customers’ non-operating funds. Retail and business deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and cost, relative to wholesale funding alternatives, in addition to providing opportunities for Peoples to build long-term client relationships through the cross-selling of its other products and services.
Peoples Bank also offers its customers the ability to receive multi-million dollar federal deposit insurance coverage for certificates of deposit ("CDs") through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") program and money market deposit accounts through the Insured Cash Sweep Services ("ICS").  Under these programs, funds from large customer deposits are placed into accounts issued by other members of the CDARS or ICS network in increments below the federal deposit insurance limits to ensure both principal and interest remain eligible for insurance. Peoples Bank also purchases certain "one-way buy" CDARS deposits, which are utilized as a wholesale funding source, and these deposits are classified as brokered CDs in Note 7 Deposits of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Peoples Bank occasionally obtains deposits from clients outside its primary market area, generally in the form of CDs, and has the ability, if needed, to obtain deposits from deposit brokers. These deposits are used to supplement 
 9

Peoples Bank's deposits to fund loans originated to customers located outside its primary market area, as well as provide diversity in funding sources. While these deposits may carry slightly higher interest costs than other wholesale funds, they do not require Peoples Bank to secure the funds with collateral, unlike most other borrowed funds. 
Additional information regarding the amounts and composition of Peoples Bank's deposits can be found in the "Deposits" section of "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" of this Form 10-K and in Note 7 Deposits of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Borrowed Funds
Peoples obtains funds through a variety of short-term and long-term borrowings, which typically include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the "FHLB") and repurchase agreements. Peoples also has the ability to obtain funds, if needed, through federal funds purchased and advances from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. In addition, Peoples has the ability to obtain funds from unrelated financial institutions in the form of term loans or revolving lines of credit. Short-term borrowings are used generally to manage Peoples' daily liquidity needs since they typically may be repaid, in whole or part, at any time without a penalty. In recent years, Peoples has utilized interest rate swaps to obtain short-term borrowings at long-term fixed rates, effectively replacing maturing long-term borrowings. Long-term borrowings provide cost-effective options for funding asset growth and satisfying capital needs, due to the variety of pricing and maturity options available.
Additional information regarding the amounts and composition of Peoples' borrowed funds can be found in the "Borrowed Funds" section of "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" of this Form 10-K and in Note 8 Short-Term Borrowings and Note 9 Long-Term Borrowings of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
Peoples experiences intense competition within its primary market area due to the presence of several national, regional and local financial institutions and other service providers, including finance companies, financial technology companies, insurance agencies and mutual fund providers. Competition within the financial services industry continues to increase as a result of mergers between, and expansion of, financial services providers within and outside of Peoples' primary market areas. In addition, the deregulation of the financial services industry (see the discussion of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 in the section of this item captioned "Supervision and Regulation – Bank Holding Company Regulation") has allowed securities firms and insurance companies that have elected to become financial holding companies to acquire commercial banks and other financial institutions, which can create additional competitive pressure. 
Peoples primarily competes based on client service, convenience and responsiveness to customer needs, product characteristics, interest rates on loans and deposits, and the availability and pricing of fiduciary, employee benefit plan, brokerage and insurance services. However, some competitors may have greater resources, including additional technology offerings and higher lending limits than Peoples, which may adversely affect Peoples' ability to compete. Peoples' business strategy includes the use of a "needs-based" sales and service approach to serve customers and is intended to promote customers' continued use of multiple financial products and services. In addition, Peoples continues to emphasize the integration of traditional commercial banking products with non-traditional financial products, such as insurance and investment products. 
Historically, Peoples has focused on providing its full range of products and services in smaller metropolitan markets rather than major metropolitan areas. While management believes Peoples has developed a level of expertise in serving the financial service needs of smaller communities, Peoples' primary market area has expanded into larger metropolitan areas, such as central, southwestern and northeastern Ohio. These larger areas typically contain entrenched service providers with existing customer bases much larger than Peoples' current position. As a result, Peoples may be forced to compete more aggressively in order to grow its market share in these areas, which could reduce current and future profit potential derived from such markets.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, Peoples had 871 full-time equivalent employees, compared to 774 at December 31, 2017. The increase in full-time equivalent employees was primarily related to the acquisition of ASB.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Peoples has registered the service marks "Peoples Bank (with logo)," "Peoples Bancorp," "Peoples Bank," Peoples in motion logo consisting of three arched ribbons, "Working Together. Building Success.", "Peoples Insurance (with logo)" and "peoplesbancorp.com" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These service marks currently have expiration 
 10

dates ranging from 2021 to 2027. Additionally, Peoples has filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the service mark registrations of "Peoples Investment Services" and "Peoples Investment Services (with logo)".
 Peoples may renew the registrations of service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office generally for additional 5 to 10-year periods indefinitely, provided it continues to use the service marks and files appropriate maintenance and renewal documentation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at the times required by the federal trademark laws and regulations. Peoples intends to continue to use its registered service marks and to timely renew the registration of each of them.
Peoples has proprietary interests in the internet domain names "pebo.com" and "peoplesbancorp.com." Internet domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries are regulated, but the laws and regulations governing the internet are continually evolving. 
Supervision and Regulation
Peoples and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state agencies. The regulation of financial holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments, and require actions to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary and other customers, as well as the Deposit Insurance Fund. They also may restrict Peoples' ability to repurchase its common shares or to receive dividends from Peoples Bank, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The following is a summary of the regulatory agencies, statutes and related regulations that have, or could have, a material impact on Peoples' business. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to such regulations and statutes.
Financial Holding Company
Peoples is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. As a financial holding company, Peoples is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"). 
The Federal Reserve Board has extensive enforcement authority over financial holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board may initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board may assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist or removal orders, and require that a financial holding company divest subsidiaries, including subsidiary banks. Peoples is routinely required to file reports and other information with the Federal Reserve Board regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiary Bank
Peoples Bank is subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions ("ODFI") and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland ("FRB"). Peoples Bank is also subject to regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which regulates consumer financial products and services, and certain financial services providers. 
Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the U.S, and the states of Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky affect the operations of Peoples Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on transactions between Peoples Bank and Peoples, limitations on the payment of dividends, and limitations on branching. Consumer laws and regulations designed to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and to ensure that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services, affect the services provided to Peoples Bank's customers. 
Non-Banking Subsidiaries 
Peoples' non-banking subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and other applicable federal and state agencies. Peoples Insurance, as a licensed insurance agency, is subject to regulation by the Ohio Department of Insurance and the state insurance regulatory agencies of those states where it may conduct business.

Other Regulatory Agencies
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq")
Peoples is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and certain state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities. Peoples is subject to the registration, disclosure, reporting and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as administered by the SEC. Peoples' common shares are listed with Nasdaq under the symbol "PEBO" and Peoples is subject to the rules for Nasdaq listed companies.
Federal Home Loan Bank
Peoples Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides credit to its members in the form of advances. As a member of the FHLB, Peoples Bank must maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB in a specified amount. Upon the origination or renewal of an advance, the FHLB is required by law to obtain and maintain a security interest in certain types of collateral. The FHLB is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long-term advances from the FHLB. The standards take into account a member's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the "CRA") and its record of lending to first-time homebuyers.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC")
The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures the deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations, and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry. Peoples Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and Peoples Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The general insurance limit is $250,000 per separately insured depositor. This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require routine reporting by insured institutions, including Peoples Bank, to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines to pose a threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits of any insured institution if the FDIC finds that the insured institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or any other regulatory agency.
Insured depository institutions are required to remit quarterly deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC, which are used to fund the Deposit Insurance Fund. Insurance premiums for each insured depository institution are determined based upon the institution's capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the institution's primary federal regulator and other information the FDIC determines to be relevant to the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund by the institution. The assessment rate determined by considering such information is then applied to the amount of the institution's average assets minus average tangible equity to determine the institution's insurance premium. An increase in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the affected institution, depending on the amount of the increase.
The FDIC assesses a quarterly deposit insurance premium on each insured institution based on risk characteristics of the institution and may also impose special assessments in emergency situations. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio ("DRR"), which is the amount in the Deposit Insurance Fund as a percentage of all Deposit Insurance Fund insured deposits. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. As of September 30, 2018, the DRR met the statutory minimum of 1.35%. As a result, the previous surcharge imposed on banks with assets of $10 billion or more was lifted. In addition, preliminary assessment credits have been determined by the FDIC for banks with assets of less than $10 billion, which had previously contributed to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%. These credits may be redeemed beginning in the quarterly assessment period in which the DRR reaches a minimum of 1.38%, and is not to exceed the total quarterly assessment due.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, which was established by the government to recapitalize a predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019. The Financing Corporation has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 29, 2019 FDIC invoice.

Bank Holding Company Regulation
In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. As a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 - also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 - which amended the BHC Act, bank holding companies that are financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (1) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), or (2) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. In 2002, Peoples elected, and received approval from the Federal Reserve Board, to become a financial holding company. 
In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, the financial holding company must be "well managed" and "well capitalized," and each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions, be well managed and have received a rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the CRA. The CRA is more fully discussed in the section captioned "Community Reinvestment Act" included later in this item. In addition, financial holding companies, like Peoples, are permitted to acquire companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature and in activities that are incidental and complementary to financial activities without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. 
The BHC Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the federal Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for a state-chartered, Federal Reserve Bank member bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the applicant's performance record under the CRA and fair housing laws, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
A financial holding company is required by law and Federal Reserve Board policy to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve Board may require a financial holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice.
Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Board Regulation W generally:

• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate;


• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with all affiliates; and


• | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate.

An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate and other similar types of transactions.
A bank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated under the Federal Reserve Act by the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals, or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank's capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.
 13

Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions and requires the respective regulatory agencies to implement systems for "prompt corrective action" for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. The regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the ODFI, and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, have adopted substantially similar regulatory capital guidelines and regulations consistent with the requirements of FDICIA, as well as established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve certain problems of undercapitalized institutions. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized."
The regulatory agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank's capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after the bank becomes "critically undercapitalized" unless the bank's primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank's capital category. For example, a bank that is not "well capitalized" generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized bank must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the bank's capital plan for the plan to be acceptable.
The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial holding companies and other bank holding companies, as well as state member banks. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels, as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.
The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard" (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee"). In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators issued new capital rules (the "Basel III Capital Rules") applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Community banking organizations, including Peoples and Peoples Bank, began transitioning to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015; whereas, the new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phased in from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital phased in from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. 
The rules include (a) a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (b) a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, (c) a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and (d) a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.
Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 
Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.
Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.
The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization’s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). The deductions phased in beginning in 2015 and were completely phased in as of January 1, 2019.
Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet 
 14

assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
The new rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5% composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625%, and was subsequently increased to 1.25% as of January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.50% on January 1, 2019.
In September 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed amendments to its capital requirements to simplify aspects of the capital rules for community banks, including Peoples Bank, in an attempt to reduce the regulatory burden for such smaller financial institutions. Because the amendments were proposed with a request for comments and have not been finalized, Peoples does not yet know what effect the final rules will have on Peoples Bank's capital calculations. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies extended for community banks the existing capital requirements for certain items that were scheduled to change effective January 1, 2018, in light of the simplification amendments being considered, including extending the existing capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets and certain other items. The intent was to prevent different rules from taking effect while the bank regulatory agencies consider a broader simplification of the capital rules. 
In November 2018, the Federal Reserve Board, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed a rule that would give community banks, including Peoples Bank, the option to calculate a simple leverage ratio, rather than multiple measures of capital adequacy, if they meet certain requirements. Under the proposal, a community bank would be eligible to elect the Community Bank Leverage Ratio ("CBLR") framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9.0%. Provided it has a CBLR greater than 9.0%, a qualifying community bank that chooses the proposed framework would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be well capitalized for the agencies' prompt corrective action rules. It is Peoples’ intent to analyze the final rule and then decide which capital option to select.
The federal banking agencies also adopted a rule providing banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). 
In order to be "well capitalized," a bank must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital of at least 10.0%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures. Peoples' management believes that Peoples Bank meets the ratio requirements to be deemed "well capitalized" according to the guidelines described above. Additional information regarding Peoples' regulatory matters can be found in Note 16 Regulatory Matters of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Community Reinvestment Act 
The CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit or other financial assistance to low and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. As of December 31, 2018, the most recent performance evaluation by the Federal Reserve Board (which was Peoples Bank's primary federal banking regulator at the time of the examination) of Peoples Bank, which was conducted in 2017, resulted in an overall rating of "Satisfactory."
Dividend Restrictions
Current banking regulations impose restrictions on Peoples Bank's ability to pay dividends to Peoples. These restrictions include a limit on the amount of dividends that may be paid in a given year without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and a prohibition on paying dividends that would cause Peoples Bank's total capital to be less than the required minimum levels under the capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board and the amount of the capital conservation buffer. Ohio law also limits the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year without prior approval of the Ohio Superintendent of Financial Institutions. Peoples Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank's net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior 
 15

two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the ODFI and the FRB. Peoples Bank's regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends at any time if the regulators determine the dividends represent unsafe and/or unsound banking practices, or reduce Peoples Bank's total capital below adequate levels. For further discussion regarding regulatory restrictions on dividends, refer to Note 16 Regulatory Matters of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Peoples' ability to pay dividends to its shareholders may also be restricted. Current Federal Reserve Board policy requires a financial holding company to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require Peoples to commit resources or contribute additional capital to Peoples Bank, which could restrict the amount of cash available for dividends. 
The Federal Reserve Board has also issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by financial holding companies and other bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a financial holding company or bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the financial holding company's or bank holding company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a financial holding company or bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the financial holding company's or bank holding company's financial health, such as by borrowing.
Peoples also has entered into certain agreements that place restrictions on dividends. Specifically, Peoples Bank is prohibited from paying dividends in an amount greater than permitted by law without requiring prior FRB or other regulatory approval. In addition, if Peoples were to elect to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities held by the NB&T Statutory Trust III, or an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing those junior subordinated debt securities, Peoples would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on Peoples' common shares. Even when the legal ability exists, Peoples or Peoples Bank may decide to limit the payment of dividends in order to retain earnings for corporate use.
Customer Privacy and Other Consumer Protections
Peoples Bank is subject to regulations limiting the ability of financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated party. Peoples Bank is also subject to numerous federal and state laws aimed at protecting consumers, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the authority granted to banking regulators under the Federal Trade Commission Act with respect to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ("UDAAP"). In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the "Payday Rule") with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with the most recent sections is not required until August 19, 2019. The first major part of the Payday Rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. The second major part of the Payday Rule applies to the same types of loans, as well as longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36%, that are repaid directly from the borrower's account. The Payday Rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower's account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer's new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The Payday Rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrower's account.
On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020. The CFPB has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days. Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The CFPB has requested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that the CFPB will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives.
 16

Peoples does not currently expect the Payday Rule to have a material effect on Peoples' financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated basis.
USA Patriot Act
The Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "USA Patriot Act") and related regulations, among other things, require financial institutions to establish programs specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to establish new accounts and establishing enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. Peoples Bank has established policies and procedures that Peoples believes comply with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act.
Monetary Policy
The Federal Reserve Board regulates money, credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, and changes in the reserve requirements against deposits of depository institutions. These policies and regulations significantly affect the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, as well as interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.
The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have significant effects in the future. In light of the changing conditions in the economy, the money markets and the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, Peoples can make no definitive predictions as to future changes in interest rates, credit availability or deposit levels.
Executive and Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (the "Joint Guidance") intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should: (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. 
In 2011, federal banking regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive-based compensation arrangements (the "First Proposed Joint Rules"). The First Proposed Joint Rules generally would have applied to financial institutions with $1.0 billion or more in assets that maintain incentive-based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees. 
In May 2016, the federal banking regulatory agencies approved a second joint notice of proposed rules (the "Second Proposed Joint Rules") designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions. The Second Proposed Joint Rules would apply to covered financial institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, and are still in proposed rules status. 
The requirements of the Second Proposed Joint Rules would differ for each of three categories of financial institutions:
•Level 1 consisting of institutions with assets of $250 billion or more;
•Level 2 consisting of institutions with assets of at least $50 billion and less than $250 billion; and
•Level 3 consisting of institutions with assets of at least $1 billion and less than $50 billion.
Some of the requirements would apply only to Level 1 and Level 2 institutions. For all covered institutions, including Level 3 institutions like Peoples Bank, the Second Proposed Joint Rules would:

• | prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that are "excessive" or "could lead to material financial loss;"


• | require incentive-based compensation that is consistent with a balance of risk and reward, effective management and control of risk, and effective governance; and


• | require board oversight, recordkeeping and disclosure to the appropriate regulatory agency.

Level 1 and Level 2 institutions would have additional requirements, including deferrals of awards to certain covered persons; potential downward adjustments, forfeitures or clawbacks; and additional risk-management and control standards, policies and procedures. In addition, certain practices and types of incentive compensation would be prohibited.
 17

Pursuant to rules adopted by the stock exchanges and approved by the SEC in January 2013 under the Dodd-Frank Act, public company compensation committee members must meet heightened independence requirements and consider the independence of compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors to the compensation committee. A compensation committee must have the authority to hire advisors and to have the public company fund reasonable compensation of such advisors.
Public companies will be required, once stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, to implement "clawback" procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards. Peoples has implemented a clawback policy and it is posted under the "Corporate Overview - Governance Documents" tab of the "Investor Relations" page of Peoples' Internet website.
SEC regulations require public companies such as Peoples to provide various disclosures about executive compensation in annual reports and proxy statements, and to present to their shareholders a non-binding vote on the approval of executive compensation.
Volcker Rule
In December 2013, five federal agencies adopted a final regulation implementing the Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Volcker Rule"). The Volcker Rule places limits on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and entities affiliated with a depository institution, subject to certain exceptions. The trading activity includes a purchase or sale as principal of a security, derivative, commodity future or option on any such instruments in order to benefit from short-term price movements or to realize short-term profits. The Volcker Rule exempts trading in specified U.S. government, agency, state and/or municipal obligations. The Volcker Rule also excepts (i) trading conducted in certain capacities; (ii) trading to satisfy a debt previously contracted; (iii) trading under certain repurchase and securities lending agreements; and (iv) trading in connection with risk-mitigating hedging activities. 
The Volcker Rule also prohibits a banking entity from having an ownership interest in, or substantial relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund, with a number of exceptions. To the extent that Peoples Bank engages in any of the trading activities or has any ownership interest in or relationship with any of the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule, Peoples Bank believes that its activities and relationships fall within the scope of one or more of the exceptions provided in the Volcker Rule. 
In December 2018, the five federal agencies that adopted the Volcker Rule proposed a rule that would exclude certain community banks, including Peoples Bank, from the Volcker Rule, consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Under the proposal, community banks with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of 5.0% or less of total consolidated assets would be excluded from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. The agencies indicated that they will no longer enforce the Volcker Rule with respect to community banks while the rulemaking is being finalized.
Effect of Environmental Regulation 
 Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of Peoples and its subsidiaries. Peoples believes the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact. Peoples, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for its current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future.
Peoples believes its primary exposure to environmental risk is through the lending activities of Peoples Bank. In cases where management believes environmental risk potentially exists, Peoples Bank mitigates its environmental risk exposure by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites. In addition, environmental assessments are typically required prior to any foreclosure activity involving non-residential real estate collateral.
Future Legislation 
 Various and significant legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced by the U.S. Congress, as evidenced by the sweeping reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act adopted in 2010, and the rollback of the Dodd-Frank Act that began in 2018. Many of the regulations mentioned above were adopted or amended pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Such legislation may continue to change banking statutes and regulations, and the operating environment of Peoples and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could 
 18

significantly increase or decrease costs of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among financial institutions. With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the subsequent rollback and the continuing implementation of final rules and regulations thereunder, as well as political changes, the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions remains very unpredictable.
Website Access to Peoples' SEC Filings
Peoples maintains an Internet website at www.peoplesbancorp.com (this uniform resource locator, or URL, is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to incorporate Peoples' Internet website into this Form 10-K). Peoples makes available free of charge on or through its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as Peoples' definitive proxy statement filed pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after Peoples electronically files each such report, amendment or proxy statement with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.
