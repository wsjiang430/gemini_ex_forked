Corporate History
 
The Company was originally incorporated with the name Brilliant Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business.
 
On January 12, 2016, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir Avenue, #123, Cranston, RI 02910, the sole shareholder of the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd. (“e-Learning”), with an address at 1-23-38-6F, Esakacho, Suita-shi, Osaka 564-0063 Japan. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to e-Learning, 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of sale.
 
Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, e-Learning gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and became the controlling shareholder of the Company.
 
On January 12, 2016, the Company changed its name to Exceed World, Inc. and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment.
 
On January 12, 2016, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.
 
On January 12, 2016, Mr. Tomoo Yoshida was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
 
On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Tomoo Yoshida, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. Pursuant to this Agreement, Tomoo Yoshida transferred to Exceed World, Inc., 10 shares of the common stock of E&F Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“E&F”), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares in consideration of $4,835 (JPY 500,000). Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of E&F’s common stock and E&F became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exceed World.  On August 4, 2016, the E&F changed its name to School TV Co., Ltd (“School TV”) and filed such amendment with the Legal Affairs Bureau in Osaka, Japan. 
 
On April 1, 2016, e-Learning entered into stock purchase agreements with 7 Japanese shareholders. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 140,000 shares of common stock in total to these individuals and received $270 as aggregate consideration. Each shareholder paid $0.215 Japanese Yen per share. At the time of purchase the price paid per share by each shareholder was the equivalent of about $0.002 USD. 
 
The aforementioned sale of shares was exempt from registration in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") because the above sales of the stock were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.
 
On August 1, 2016, the Company changed its fiscal year end from November 30 to September 30. 
 
On August 9, 2016, e-Learning entered into stock purchase agreements with 33 Japanese shareholders. Pursuant to these agreements, e-Learning sold 3,300 shares of common stock in total to these individuals and received $330 as aggregate consideration. Each shareholder paid 10 Japanese Yen per share. At the time of purchase the price paid per share by each shareholder was the equivalent of about $0.1 USD. 
 
These shares were sold pursuant to the Company’s effective S-1 Registration Statement deemed effective on July 20, 2016 at 4pm EST. 
 
On October 28, 2016, Exceed World, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (the “Company” or “Exceed”), with the approval of its board of directors and its majority shareholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting, authorized the cancellation of shares owned by e-Learning. e-Learning has provided consent for the cancellation of shares.

(“20-for-1 Forward Stock Split”) No fractional shares were issued. The authorized number of shares, and par value per share, of Common Stock are not affected by the 20-for-1 Forward Stock Split.
 
On October 28, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.

In order to access the Group’s e-learning programs, customers must first register as a member of Force Club. From 2002 to 2007 the Group began to offer its e-learning programs to customers via CD-ROMs with pre-loaded learning content. Due to the rise in internet usage, the Group has made its e-learning programs available on its website for its customers from 2007 onwards. Customers need to pay a monthly fee in order to access and view the most up-to-date content on the website of the Group.
 
In light of the increasing popularity of tablet devices, and to cater to the demand of young learners and users in rural areas of Japan, the Group released its e-learning programs on smartphones and tablet devices for customer use beginning in 2012. The e-learning programs of Force Club are designed for residents of Japan, and thus the e-learning programs are presented in Japanese only and no translated version is available.
 
Beginning in 2015, in addition to e-learning, the Group began to conduct offline classes, such as the Force Abacus School (teaching abacus and arithmetic by using the Ishido method) and Force Robot Programming School (a program related to computer programming by using tablet-type devices). At present any and all offline courses are, and will be, taught by teachers contracted by the Group.
 
The Group regularly updates its e-learning materials and programs and performs an annual review of all courses. However, if any changes in rules and regulations will affect the Group’s materials or programs (such as amendments to the Course of Study by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), such changes will be reflected in our materials and programs accordingly. In particular, the learning resources supplementing elementary school, junior high school and senior high school curriculum would be overhauled in conjunction with any revision of school curriculums, which generally takes place once in a four-year period. In addition, most preparation courses for university entrance examinations and professional qualification examinations would be revised at one to two-year intervals to cater to any changes to the examination syllabus. The website of the Group is updated from time to time to reflect the updates and changes to the learning materials and programs. For users with smartphones and tablet devices, these updates can also be downloaded from the Group’s website.
 
The website of e-Learning Laboratory Co. Ltd can be found at the following link: https://e-ll.co.jp/en/ Users can find corporate information on the website as well as the company’s business, services and social contribution activities. Visitors to the website can find information on the Force Club (which will be detailed below), as well as MANA Digi (the company’s online portal site for business education) and GAKU LOG (an online portal with information regarding educational institution, from kindergarten to graduate school).
 
Business Model
 
Apart from using a conventional direct sales marketing strategy, the Group has also adopted multilevel marketing (“MLM”), via the Premium Membership in the Force Club, in operating its businesses.
 
Since 2002, the Group has adopted a direct sales marketing strategy to market its e-learning programs. Subsequently, in 2007, the Group gradually changed its marketing strategy from direct sales to MLM for the purposes of (i) establishing its brand name and penetrating into the rural areas of Japan; (ii) promoting its products to wider customer groups through premium members; and (iii) incentivizing premium members to recruit new members to join Force Club in order to increase the sales of its products and maximize profits for the Group. Currently, the Group has no retail shops or other point-of-sale for its products (e-learning courses).
 
MLM was adopted by the Group in order to expand the sales of its e-learning programs through its Force Club members. There are two tiers of Force Club members, namely standard members and premium members. Among Force Club members, premium members get a tablet device which entitles the premium members to life-time access of all of the Group’s e-learning educational content. Since the Group’s e-learning education programs are distributed in the form of online downloads, it can be used both online and offline.

Force Club Membership
 
Force Club members are those who intend to use products and services the Group offers. There are two tiers of Force Club members, namely standard members and premium members. Premium members”) are those who wish to engage in recruiting new members (“Premium Members”).
 
Premium Members have to join a premium plan under which members are given rights to use all products and services of the Group, and engage in activities to recruit new Force Club members and obtain monetary rewards and bonuses (special income or commissions) from such activities. The Group enters into a contract (the “Premium Member Contract”) with each of its Premium Members. The salient terms of the Premium Member Contract are as follows:
 
Eligibility - the following individuals/corporations are eligible to register as the Group’s Premium Members:
 
(i) Individuals (other than students) who are 20 years old or above and are residents of Japan; and
 (ii) Corporations established in Japan.
 
Applicants are required to provide proof of identity, such as driver’s license, passport or resident card for individual members or a certified copy of the commercial registration for corporate members.
 
Payments – an applicant who wishes to be a Force Club Premium Member has to join the premium plan and pay an initial payment of JPY453,600, comprising:
 
(i) The one-off registration fee of JPY10,800;
 (ii) The premium package fee of JPY421,200; and
 (iii)An advanced payment of monthly membership fees for the initial two months amounting to JPY21,600.
 
Standard members pay the same registration fee, but a reduced monthly rate and no premium package fee. Monthly membership fees payable from the third month onwards will be automatically transmitted from a member’s bank account until termination of membership.
 
Based on provisions described fully in the Premium Member Contract there are fees related to, but not exclusively limited to, cancellation of membership and other stipulations pursuant to certain actions. If a Premium Member does not pay the monthly membership fee before the prescribed due date, such Premium Member will be disqualified and will not be paid any commission with respect to his/her recruitment performance in the preceding month, and Force Club services for such Premium Member will be suspended in the following month. The commission and Force Club services for such Premium Member will be resumed in the subsequent month if the monthly membership fee is paid within three months from the due date. Otherwise, the Premium Member is deemed to have withdrawn from his membership if the monthly membership fee is not paid for three consecutive months after the payment due date.
 
In addition, the Premium Member Contract sets out the rules of conduct required to be observed by Premium Members in recruiting new members to join Force Club. The Group is entitled to suspend a Premium Member’s business activities, suspend his or her commission, demand return of commission(s), remove his or her title, or terminate his or her membership if such Premium Member violates or infringes the rules of conduct or other related laws or regulations, and/or acts in a way that is offensive to public order and morals.
 
Upon registration as Force Club members, applicants will be given a user ID to gain access to the e-learning programs through Force Club platform. Force Club members will be given additional four user IDs after registration so that they can use a total of five user IDs for accessing e-learning content through Force Club platform.
 
The number of Force Club members has increased from approximately 3,989 as of September 30, 2008 to approximately 7,635 as of the date of this report.
 
Competition
 
We believe that our main competitors are those provide similar e-learning product offerings in Japan. Specifically, we believe our biggest competitors at present are Recruit Marketing Partners Co., Ltd., which provides "Study Supplements", JustSystem Corporation, which provides "Smile Zemi", Benesse Corporation which provides "Challenge Touch" and SuRaLa Net Co., Ltd. which provides "SuRaLa", whose product offerings are also consistent of e-learning programs and services.
Current Advertising
 
Our advertising expenses are primarily comprised of, but not limited to, sales events hosted for sales agents, exhibitions to promote and display company product offerings, signboards, and public relations activities.
Future Plans
 
Over the course of the next twelve months, the Group intends to focus on expanding its sales network in order to strengthen its business activities. Currently, revenue is derived primarily from sales of the premium package. While it is the intention of the Group to maintain this revenue stream, and to further increase the number of premium members of the Force Club, the Group also intends to diversify its operations and develop additional business activities.
 
In order to do so, the Group intends to focus on development of an online educational platform on which additional advertising income can be generated. At present, there are no definitive plans that have been made regarding the implementation or direction of this future online educational platform. However, we intend to begin efforts to hire additional personnel with extensive experience in web marketing in order to assist in the development of our future platform.
 
Further, it is the intention of the Group to begin development of a plan to set up after-school care facilities within Japan. Our exact plan has not been finalized in any capacity, as we will need to hire additional personnel in order to assist with the formulation of such plans with any level of specificity.
 
Employees
 
The number of the employees of the Company, and all subsidiaries, as of the filing date is forty-six. All forty-six employees are considered full-time employees. We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our officers/or directors and or employees.
Government Regulations
 
Companies in Japan are regulated by the “Act on Specified Commercial Transactions in Japan.” The Company believes it is fully in compliance with this Act, which outlines the rules and regulation regarding transactions arising from door-to-door sales, mail order sales, telemarketing sales, and multilevel marketing transactions, among other transactions defined in the Act.
 
The Group has legal counsel in Japan whom provides instruction, direction, and reviews Company activities to ensure, to the best of Legal Counsel’s knowledge, that the Company is in compliance with the aforementioned Act.

Former Business Plan
 
*The below plans pertain to our operations up until December 6, 2018, when 100% of the Company’s equity interest in School TV was transferred to Force Internationale, a Cayman Island limited company, without consideration. As of December 6, 2018, the below business plan is no longer related, in any way, to the Company. Any language that is written in present tense, in the below business plan, is only current as of the period in which School TV was a subsidiary of the Company.
 
We operate three lines of business through our wholly owned subsidiary, School TV. These include:
 - The sale and distribution of health-related products;
 - The promotion of third-party consumer goods and services; and
 - RE/MAX realtor business in Kanagawa, Okinawa, and Tokyo, Japan.
 
Nature of Business: Sale and Distribution of Health-Related Products
 



*The chart above does not depict when we make direct sales to consumers. 
 
School TV sells primarily health related consumer goods to distributors and consumers alike. School TV primarily operates under the operational model of “drop shipping.” It should be noted however, that School TV does hold inventory and sells products directly to the consumer from time to time. For products sold through our drop shipping model, after a purchase order has been filled out by a consumer the product is shipped out by School TV’s suppliers, rather than School TV. School TV sends a portion of the proceeds from the sale of any our products directly to suppliers when sold through the drop shipping model. This accounts for Exceed World’s cost of the good and any other related expenses. School TV is responsible for shipping goods sold that come from its own supply of inventory.
 
School TV has acquired its physical inventory, which will be explained in further detail below, from suppliers, and has plans to acquire additional inventory from as of yet unidentified suppliers.
 
School TV has future intentions to create an online marketplace to sell goods through but at this time, has not yet begun pursuing development of such a marketplace or website. Plans and timeline of such also remain undetermined.
 
School TV has no storefront and there is no guarantee that it will ever obtain a storefront. School TV is not actively seeking to acquire a storefront and it relies exclusively on personal relationships of our Chief Executive Officer to sell its current inventory.

Process of Ordering, Delivery and Payment
 
Should a customer purchase a health related supplement or product directly from School TV, the Company provides the purchaser a “call sheet” or in other words a purchase order form which includes but is not limited to, basic information on the purchaser, the shipping address of the purchaser, and payment details of the purchaser. School TV offers standard methods of shipping for its products at the cost of the purchaser. School TV bills the purchaser directly as the purchase is from School TV’s own stock of inventory.
 
Purchasers may also decide to purchase products through particular ‘distributors’ or sales agents of School TV. In this case the distributors receive a commission decided upon by the Company on a case by case basis. Payments, billing, and shipping are still handled by School TV.
 
For products not available in School TV’s inventory, the Company utilizes the drop-shipping model described in the proceeding paragraphs. In this case School TV is responsible for collecting payment and shipping information from the purchaser and then provides this information to the supplier at which time the supplier bills the purchaser for the purchase of the product(s) and handles any shipping of the product(s) thereafter. A commission is then paid to School TV for facilitating the transaction. Commissions are on a case by case basis with no set commission. 
 
Competition - Health, Food, and Related Goods
 
Our primary competition comes from other health food and supplement companies within Japan, but can also include global companies who offer their products within Japan. Some of our competitors have larger resources than we have, a longer operating history, and established connections throughout our target regions, which may make it difficult to penetrate into the market effectively. Even if we do manage to penetrate into the health food and or supplement market with our products there can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with these established competitors.
 
Our competition includes, but is not limited to, MUSO Co., Ltd, Asahi Food & Healthcare Co., Ltd., Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.. Several of these competitors have an established track record in Japan and offer highly valued products throughout the country, which may serve to make it more difficult for our own products to gain attention as we begin operations.
 
Nature of Business: Promotion of Third-Party Consumer Goods and Services
 
In addition to our retail and drop-shipping business described above we also provide promotional services for third party businesses and receive a commission upon the sale of such product(s) or service(s). Included below we have disclosed the name, and principal good or service, of each third party business to whom we offer promotional services.
 
Products and Services - Sales

Process of Ordering, Delivery and Payment
 
Any and all billing, fulfillment, and shipping (if applicable) related to this business is handled entirely by the supplier of each product or service exclusively. We receive a commission upon facilitating a sale of a service or product that varies on a case by case basis. We are not directly involved in the sale of any product or service in any way except for assisting with facilitating the sale via promotional services.
Nature of Business: RE/MAX Realtor Business in Kanagawa, Okinawa, and Tokyo, Japan
 
Basic structure



Kanagawa region and Okinawa region
 
On July 7, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, School TV entered into a RE/MAX Regional Franchise Agreement with the master franchisor of RE/MAX Japan, Kidding Co., to lease the franchise rights to two Japanese Prefectures, Kanagawa and Okinawa, in consideration of JPY75,060,000 ($674,333) effective on July 7, 2017. Both lease terms are for a term of fifteen years and, after expiration of the lease term, School TV will need to pay to renew its rights to franchise RE/MAX should the Company decide to do so at that time. (*1, *2)
 
As depicted in the chart above, School TV has leased the rights to be regional franchisor owner of RE/MAX brokerage offices in two Prefectures (regions) of Japan from Kidding Co. Kidding Co. is the managing company for all of Japan’s RE/MAX operations. School TV is not engaged in any real estate activities and any brokerage offices opened up in these prefectures under School TV will be Japanese real estate companies with the proper licenses to carry out real estate sales and activities.
 
There is no brokerage office in either of these Prefectures and we have not yet generated any income relating to these activities. School TV is actively searching for real estate companies which will agree to open up, own and run RE/MAX broker offices for each region. However, any and all plans regarding the identification of an appropriate and interested real estate company remain speculative in nature and are still under development. (*3)
 
Tokyo region
 
On July 28, 2017, School TV entered into an Agreement with Investech Co. whereas it is agreed that School TV will provide monetary support to Investech Co., a Japanese Company, which operates a real estate brokerage office of RE/MAX Japan in the Tokyo region (the “Investech Agreement”). (*4)
 
On July 28, 2017, School TV entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Kidding Co., pursuant to which Kidding Co. consents for School TV to provide monetary support to Investech Co., a Japanese Company, which operates a regional branch of RE/MAX Japan in the Tokyo region (further details can be found in the agreement titled “Kidding MOU”).
 
The Tokyo region has the largest real estate market in Japan. However, there is no regional owner in the Tokyo area. As such, Kidding Co. conducts management of the RE/MAX location in Tokyo, Japan.
