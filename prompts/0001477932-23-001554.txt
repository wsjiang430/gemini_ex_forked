2022 - Late Filings and Restatements

On October 31, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the SEC (“SEC Comment Letter”) with respect to Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed on October 14, 2020. Among other things, the SEC Comment Letter questioned the Company’s historical accounting treatment regarding the sale of our Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Stock”). The Company recorded such sales as “permanent equity” and the SEC Comment Letter suggested the appropriate accounting classification was something other than permanent equity given certain provisions within the Certificate of Designation for the Series C Stock (“COD”). 

In November 2021, the Company believed it had determined the appropriate accounting treatment and filed an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended March 31, 2020, inclusive of restated comparative financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019, an amended Quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for the three months ended June 30, 2020, and an amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for the three- and six-month periods ended September 30, 2020. 

Subsequent to filing the amended filings, the Company was advised by the SEC that the staff continued to question the accounting treatment for the Series C Shares. Consequently, the Company continued to defer filing Annual Reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q until the matter had been resolved. On March 28, 2022 the Company filed Form 8-K, Item 4.02 non-reliance on previously filed financial statements

After numerous consultations with the SEC staff and the Company’s accounting advisors, in May 2022, the Company concluded on the proper accounting treatment and filed all financial statements then outstanding to bring the Company current with its filing requirements at such time.

 General 

Camber is based in Houston, Texas.  Incorporated in Nevada in December 2003 under the name Panorama Investments Corp., the Company changed its name to Lucas Energy, Inc., effective June 9, 2006, and effective January 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to Camber Energy, Inc.  

Camber’s aim is to become a growth-oriented diversified energy company. The Company owns minority, non-operated working interests in certain oil & gas wells in Texas, and through its investment in Viking Energy Group, Inc. (“Viking”), the organization provides custom energy & power solutions to commercial and industrial clients in North America. Viking also holds an exclusive license in Canada to a patented carbon-capture system, and has a majority interest in: (i) an entity with intellectual property rights to a fully developed, patented, proprietary Medical & Bio-Hazard Waste Treatment system using Ozone Technology; and (ii) entities with the intellectual property rights to fully developed, patent pending, proprietary Electric Transmission and Distribution Open Conductor Detection Systems.  The Company is also exploring other renewable energy-related opportunities and/or technologies.

On December 16, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada to effect a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-50. As a result of the reverse stock split, each fifty (50) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding were combined into one (1) new share of common stock. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share numbers in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and included in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.

Viking Investment 

On December 23, 2020, Camber entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Viking to acquire (the “Viking Acquisition” or the “Acquisition”) 26,274,510 shares of Viking’s common stock, constituting 51% of the issued common stock of Viking (the “Initial Viking Shares”), in consideration of (i) the payment of $10,900,000 in cash by Camber to Viking, which was retained by Viking (the “Cash Purchase Price”), and (ii) Camber canceling $9,200,000 in promissory notes previously issued to Camber by Viking (the February 3, 2020 promissory note for $5,000,000 and the June 25, 2020 promissory note for $4,200,000, collectively the “Viking Notes”) along with accrued interest. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Viking is generally obligated (subject to certain limitations) to issue additional shares of Viking common stock to Camber to ensure that Camber shall own at least 51% of the common stock of Viking through July 1, 2022.

In connection with the investment, on December 23, 2020, the Company also entered into (i) a termination agreement with Viking terminating the prior Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 31, 2020, as amended (the “Termination Agreement”), and (ii) an Assignment of Camber’s 30% Membership Interest in one of Viking’s subsidiaries, Elysium Energy Holdings, LLC, back to Viking (the “Assignment”). Also in connection with the Acquisition, on December 23, 2020, the Company (i) borrowed $12,000,000 from the institutional investor described in the “Preferred Stock Financing Transactions” section below (the “Investor”); (ii) issued the Investor a promissory note in the principal amount of $12,000,000 (the “December 23rd Investor Note”), accruing interest at the rate of 10% per annum and maturing December 11, 2022; (iii) granted the Investor a first-priority security interest in the Initial Viking Shares and the Company’s other assets pursuant to a Security Agreement-Pledge (the “December 23rd Pledge Agreement”), and a general security agreement (the “December 23rd Security Agreement”), respectively; and (iv) entered into an amendment to the Company’s $6,000,000 promissory note previously issued to the Investor dated December 11, 2020, amending the acceleration provision of the note to provide that the note repayment obligations would not accelerate if Camber had increased its authorized capital stock by March 11, 2021 (the “Note Amendment”). On February 23, 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 25,000,000 to 250,000,000, which amendment was filed with the State of Nevada on February 23, 2021.

On December 23, 2020, the December 23rd Investor Note was funded, and the Company closed the investment, paying the Cash and assigning the membership interests to Viking and cancelling the Viking Notes and related accrued interest. At the closing, James Doris and Frank Barker, Jr., Viking’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), respectively, were appointed the CEO and CFO, respectively, of the Company, and Mr. Doris was appointed a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.

On January 8, 2021, the Company entered into another purchase agreement with Viking pursuant to which the Company increased its investment by acquiring an additional 16,153,846 shares of Viking common stock (the “Additional Viking Shares”) in consideration of (i) the Company issuing 1,890 shares of Camber’s Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to EMC Capital Partners, LLC (“EMC”), one of the Viking’s lenders which held a secured promissory note with an original principal amount of $20,869,218 in connection with the purchase of oil and gas assets on or about February 3, 2020 (the “EMC Note”); and (ii) EMC considering the EMC Note, and related accrued interest, paid in full and cancelled pursuant to the Cancellation Agreement described below. 

Simultaneously, on January 8, 2021, Viking entered into a Cancellation Agreement with EMC (the “Cancellation Agreement”) pursuant to which Viking agreed to pay $325,000 to EMC, and EMC agreed to cancel and terminate in the EMC Note and all other liabilities, claims, amounts owing and other obligations under the Note.

On July 29, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Viking to acquire an additional 27,500,000 shares of Viking common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $11,000,000.

As a result of these three investments, the Company owned approximately 61% of the outstanding common shares of Viking as of December 31, 2021.

The Company has determined that its ownership of the common shares of Viking gives the Company the ability to exercise significant influence over Viking, but not control from an accounting perspective pursuant to applicable accounting rules and/or guidelines, and therefore the Company has not consolidated the financial statements of Viking into the Company’s financial statements. Rather, the Company accounts for its investment in Viking under the equity method.

Merger Agreement with Viking

On February 15, 2021, Camber entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Viking. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Camber (“Merger Sub”) will then merge with and into Viking (the “Merger”), with Viking surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Camber (the “Combined Company”).

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share: (i) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Viking (the “Viking Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares owned by Camber, Viking and Merger Sub, will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of Camber; and (ii) of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of Viking (the “Viking Preferred Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Camber (the “Camber Series A Preferred Stock”). Each share of Camber Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible into 890 shares of common stock of Camber (subject to a beneficial ownership limitation preventing conversion into Camber common stock if the holder would be deemed to beneficially own more than 9.99% of Camber’s common stock), will be treated equally with Camber’s common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation, and will only have voting rights with respect to voting: (a) on a proposal to increase or reduce Camber’s share capital; (b) on a resolution to approve the terms of a buy-back agreement; (c) on a proposal to wind up Camber; (d) on a proposal for the disposal of all or substantially all of Camber’s property, business and undertaking; (f) during the winding-up of Camber; and/or (g) with respect to a proposed merger or consolidation in which Camber is a party or a subsidiary of Camber is a party. Holders of Viking Common Stock and Viking Preferred Stock will have any fractional shares of Camber common stock or preferred stock after the Merger rounded up to the nearest whole share.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Viking equity award, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in respect of each share of Viking Common Stock underlying such equity award and, in the case of Viking stock options, be converted into vested Camber stock options based on the merger exchange ratio calculated as provided above (the “Exchange Ratio”).

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that effective as of the Effective Time, James A. Doris, the current Chief Executive Officer of both Viking and Camber, shall serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the resulting merged entity (the “Combined Company”) following the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement provides that, as of the Effective Time, the Combined Company will have its headquarters in Houston, Texas.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Camber and Viking will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, to provide non-public information to third parties and to engage in discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to customary exceptions. Viking is required to hold a meeting of its stockholders to vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that its stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Camber is required to hold a meeting of its stockholders to approve the issuance of Viking Common Stock and Viking Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Merger Share Issuance”).

The completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by Camber’s stockholders and approval of the Merger Share Issuances by Camber’s stockholders, (ii) receipt of required regulatory approvals, (iii) effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 for the Camber common stock to be issued in the Merger (the “Form S-4”), and (iv) the absence of any law, order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger or making the completion of the Merger illegal. Each party’s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, performance by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and (iii) the absence of any material adverse effect on the other party, as defined in the Merger Agreement.

Additional closing conditions to the Merger include that in the event the NYSE American determines that the Merger constitutes, or will constitute, a “back-door listing” or “reverse merger,” Camber (and its common stock) would be required to qualify for initial listing on the NYSE American, pursuant to the applicable guidance and requirements of the NYSE as of the Effective Time.

The Merger Agreement can be terminated (i) at any time with the mutual consent of the parties; (ii) by either Camber or Viking if any governmental consent or approval required for closing is not obtained, or any governmental entity issues a final non-appealable order or similar decree preventing the Merger; (iii) by either Viking or Camber if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before August 1, 2021; (iv) by Camber or Viking, upon the breach by the other of a term of the Merger, which is not cured within 30 days of the date of written notice thereof by the other; (v) by Camber if Viking is unable to obtain the affirmative vote of its stockholders for approval of the Merger; (vi) by Viking if Camber is unable to obtain the affirmative vote of its stockholders required pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement; and (vii) by Viking or Camber if there is a willful breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party thereto.

The Merger Agreement has no impact on the Camber Series C Preferred Stock.

The Merger Agreement contains customary indemnification obligations of the parties and representations and warranties.

The representations, warranties and covenants of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made only for the purposes of, and were and are solely for the benefit of the parties to, the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly, the representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs at the date they were made or at any other time, and investors should not rely on them as statements of fact. In addition, such representations and warranties (i) will not survive consummation of the Merger and (ii) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the parties’ public disclosures. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any factual information regarding Camber or Viking, their respective affiliates or their respective businesses. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding Camber, Viking, their respective affiliates or their respective businesses, the Merger Agreement and the Merger that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, a Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement of Camber and Viking and a prospectus of Viking, as well as in the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings that each of Camber and Viking make with the SEC.

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1.

As of March 17, 2023, neither the Company nor Viking had advised of its intention to terminate the Merger Agreement. However, given the lapse of time since the date of the Merger Agreement, the Company believes it is reasonably likely that certain terms would need to be modified by the parties in order for the parties to proceed with the Merger. 

On or about March 14, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors resolved to enter into negotiations with Viking to modify certain terms of the Merger and to re-engage a valuation firm in connection with securing a fairness opinion or any other valuation report, analyses or presentations that might be necessary or appropriate regarding the Merger. As of March 17, 2023, the Company had not determined the revised terms upon which it would be prepared to proceed with the Merger. Any modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement would be subject to the written agreement of both the Company and Viking, and there is no assurance that the Company and Viking will agree on any such proposed modifications. Moreover, the satisfaction of conditions, whether existing or new, may be outside of the Company’s control.

Lineal Acquisition and Divestiture:

On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Redemption Agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”) by and between the Company and the prior owners of Lineal, whereby the Company redeemed the Company’s Series E and F Preferred Stock (the holders of such preferred stock, collectively, the “Preferred Holders”) issued in connection with the Lineal Merger (as defined in Note 2). Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2019, ownership of 100% of Lineal was transferred back to the Preferred Holders, and, all of the Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock of the Company outstanding were canceled through the redemption (the “Lineal Divestiture”). The Redemption Agreement also provided for (a) the entry by Lineal and the Company into a new unsecured promissory note in the amount of $1,539,719, the outstanding amount of the July 2019 Lineal Note together with additional amounts loaned by Camber to Lineal through December 31, 2019 (the “December 2019 Lineal Note”); and, (b) the unsecured loan by the Company to Lineal on December 31, 2019 of an additional $800,000, entered into by Lineal in favor of the Company on December 31, 2019 (“Lineal Note No. 2”); The December 2019 Lineal Note and Lineal Note No. 2, accrued interest, payable quarterly in arrears, beginning on March 31, 2020 and continuing until December 31, 2021, when all interest and principal was due, at 8% and 10% per annum (18% upon the occurrence of an event of default), respectively. Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, the parties thereto mutually agreed to unwind the Lineal Merger and allow for the redemption in full of Lineal by the Preferred Holders. In connection therewith, the Company redeemed the Company’s Series E and F Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Lineal Merger and ownership of 100% of Lineal was transferred back to the Preferred Holders, and all of the Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock of the Company outstanding were cancelled through the redemption.
Preferred Stock Financing Transactions:

June, 2020:

On and effective June 22, 2020, the Company and Discover Growth Fund, LLC ( “Discover”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “June 2020 Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Discover purchased 630 shares of the Company’s Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) for $6 million, at a 5% original issue discount to the $10,000 face value of such preferred stock (the “Face Value”).  The Company loaned $4.2 million of the funds provided by the June 2020 Purchase Agreement to Viking in connection with the purchase of the June 2020 Secured Note.  On or about December 11, 2020, 600 of the 630 Series C Shares sold to Discover in June, 2020 were returned by Discover for cancelation in exchange for a $6 million Promissory Note, leaving 30 Series C Shares outstanding from the June, 2020 transaction.  On or about May 17, 2022, Discover converted these 30 Series C Shares into 3,848,449 shares of common stock (equivalent to approximately 76,969 common shares on a post-reverse stock split basis) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation(s), as amended, associated with the Series C Preferred Stock.  

11


As of December 31, 2022, Discover held zero shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and Discover is not entitled to any common shares in connection with prior conversions.

January, 2021:

On or about January 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with EMC pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 1,890 shares of Camber’s Series C Preferred Stock to EMC Capital Partners, LLC (“EMC”).

EMC converted 226 shares of Series C Preferred Stock Shares in tranches: (i) 38 shares on September 14, 2021; (ii) 59 shares on October 7, 2021; and (iii) 129 shares on January 3, 2022 (at which time EMC no longer held any shares of Series C Preferred Stock).  The aggregate number of common shares issued to EMC in connection with its conversion of the 226 shares of Series C Preferred Stock equaled 154,186,428 (equivalent to approximately 3,083,729 common shares on a post-reverse stock split basis) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation(s), as amended, associated with the Series C Preferred Stock.  In January, 2022 the Company redeemed and cancelled 1,664 of EMC’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock.  

As of December 31, 2022, EMC held zero shares of Series C Preferred Stock, but is entitled to 730,241 common shares in connection with prior conversions.  The Company anticipates issuing these common shares to EMC if the Company’s shareholders approve an increase in the Company’s authorized capital.  

July, 2021:

Effective as of July 9, 2021, the Company and Antilles Family Office, LLC (“Antilles”), an affiliate of Discover, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “July 2021 Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Antilles purchased 1,575 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $15 million, at a 5% original issue discount to the $10,000 face value of each share of preferred stock.  Between May 17 and December 31, 2022, Antilles converted 1,305 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 393,305,736 shares of common stock (equivalent to approximately 7,866,115 common shares on a post-reverse stock split basis) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation(s), as amended, associated with the Series C Preferred Stock.  

Pursuant to the July 2021 Purchase Agreement, as long as Antilles holds any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, we agreed that, except as contemplated in connection with the Merger, we would not issue or enter into or amend an agreement pursuant to which we may issue any shares of common stock, other than (a) for restricted securities with no registration rights, (b) in connection with a strategic acquisition, (c) in an underwritten public offering, or (d) at a fixed price. We also agreed that we would not issue or amend any debt or equity securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or including the right to receive, shares of common stock (i) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon or varies with, the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of common stock at any time after the initial issuance of the security or (ii) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of the security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the common stock.

We also agreed that if we issue any security with any term more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to Antilles, then we would notify Antilles of such additional or more favorable term and such term, at the Investor’s option, may become a part of the transaction documents with the Investor. We agreed to include proposals relating to the approval of the July 2021 Purchase Agreement and the issuance of the shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the July 2021 Purchase Agreement, as well as an increase in authorized common stock to fulfill our obligations to issue such shares, at the Company’s next Annual Meeting, the meeting held to approve the Merger or a separate meeting in the event the Merger is terminated prior to shareholder approval, and to use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals as soon as possible and in any event prior to January 1, 2022.


12


As at December 31, 2022, Antilles held 270 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.  The Company estimated these shares would convert into approximately 3.8 million common shares pursuant to the conversion formula set out in the Certificate of Designation(s), as amended, associated with the Series C Preferred Stock, using approximately $2.185 as the then low volume weighted average price (“Low VWAP”) of the Company’s common stock for the purposes of calculating the Conversion Premium due upon conversion.  The Low VWAP fell to approximately $1.2813 in March, 2023, which increased the underlying common share estimate from 3.8 million to 6.69 million common shares.  If the Low VWAP during the Measurement Period (as defined in the Certificate of Designation, as amended) falls below $1.2813, Antilles would be entitled to more than 6.69 million common shares.

Exchange Agreement, Promissory Notes and Security Agreements:

Exchange Agreement

On December 11, 2020, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Discover pursuant to which Discover exchanged 600 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, with an aggregate face value of $6,000,000 (600 shares each with a face value of $10,000 per share), for a $6,000,000 secured Promissory Note, and the 600 Preferred Shares were cancelled. 
Summary of Promissory Notes

Between December 11th, 2020 and December 24, 2021, the Company executed and delivered the following Secured Promissory Notes in favor of Discover:


1. | Promissory Note dated December 11, 2020 in the original amount of $6,000,000 (the “December 11th Investor Note”), which was issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement described above;

The December 9, 2021 Investor Note was paid in full on January 4, 2022.  All other Promissory Notes remain outstanding and have a maturity date of January 1, 2027 (collectively, the “Outstanding Notes”).

Discover previously had the right to convert all or a portion of the amounts owing under the Outstanding Notes into shares of common stock of the Company at a fixed conversion price, but pursuant to an Agreement signed by Discover and the Company on or about November 3, 2022, Discover waived all of such conversion entitlements.

Further Particulars of Promissory Notes & Security Agreements

Further particulars regarding the various Promissory Notes and associated Security Agreements are set out below.

Prior to December 24, 2021, all applicable Outstanding Notes accrued interest at the rate of 10% per annum after which the interest rate was reduced to 3.25% per annum pursuant to applicable amending agreements signed on December 24, 2021 between the Company and Discover regarding each Outstanding Note; however the interest rate increases to the highest non-usurious rate of interest allowed under applicable law upon the occurrence of an event of default, which interest is due on the maturity date, which maturity date is the earlier of (a) January 1, 2027; and (b) the date a change of control of the Company occurs, which includes any person becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company (a “Change in Ownership”), or the approval of (1) a plan of complete liquidation, (2) an agreement for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Company’s assets, or (3) a merger (other than a merger for purposes of redomiciling the Company), consolidation, or reorganization of the Company, which would result in a Change in Ownership, provided that the closing of the Merger will not trigger a change of control (or Change in Ownership). All Outstanding Notes includes customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Discover has the right to accelerate the full amount of the Outstanding Notes and all interest thereon, to enforce its rights under the applicable Security Agreements (defined below), and take other actions allowed under applicable law.

The Outstanding Notes may be assigned by Discover subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The Company may prepay the Outstanding Notes at any time.

Throughout 2021 and early 2022, the Company did not satisfy the Filing Requirement and, consequently, on or about March 9, 2022, the preferred stock holders, Discover and Antilles, filed a Verified Complaint against the Company (the “Discover/Antilles Complaint”) as a result of the default by the Company under the CODs. A default under the CODs and/or SPA’s is also considered an event of default under each of the Outstanding Notes, and upon an event of default under the Outstanding Notes, Discover may, at its option, declare the principal and any and all interest then accrued thereon, at once due and payable, and exercise any other rights under applicable agreements. Discover did not exercise its right to declare the amount owing under the Outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, but Failure by Discover to exercise such right does not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default. As of April 18, 2022, Discover, Antilles and the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement to settle the Discover/Antilles Complaint, and the Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court on or about May 12, 2022. If the Company fails to satisfy future Filing Requirements, it would be considered a default under the CODs and SPA’s, which in turn would constitute an event of default under the Outstanding Notes.
October, 2022

On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into two agreements (collectively, the “Agreements”), one with Discover and the other with Antilles, in relation to an amendment to the fifth amended and restated certificate of designations regarding the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock (the “COD”) as an accommodation to the Company and in order to help facilitate implementation of the Company’s business plans and continued trading on the NYSE American LLC, and in exchange for the release and indemnity as provided in the Agreements.

On October 31, 2022, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada an amendment to the COD (the “Amendment), dated as of October 28, 2022 (the “Amendment Date”), pursuant to the Agreements, which amended the COD such that (i) beginning on the Amendment Date and thereafter, when determining the conversion rate for each share of Series C Preferred Stock based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) over a certain number of previous days (“Measurement Period”), no day will be added to what would otherwise have been the end of any Measurement Period for the failure of the Equity Condition (as defined in the COD), even if the volume weighted average trading price (“Measuring Metric”) is not at least $1.50 and each Investor waived the right to receive any additional shares of Common Stock that might otherwise be due if such Equity Condition were to apply after the Agreement Date, including with respect to any pending Measurement Period; and (ii) (A) beginning on the Amendment Date and for the period through December 30, 2022, the Measuring Metric will be the higher of the amount provided in Section I.G.7.1(ii) of the COD and $0.20, and (B) beginning at market close on December 30, 2022 and thereafter, the Measuring Metric will be the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock on any day of trading following the date of first issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock.

November, 2022

On November 3, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with Discover, pursuant to which Discover absolutely and unconditionally waived and released any and all rights to receive further or additional shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Shares”) with respect to any and all shares of Series C Preferred Stock previously converted by Discover including, but not limited to, the right to deliver additional notices for more Conversion Shares under the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations of Preferences, Powers, Rights and Limitations of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock filed by the Company with the Secretary of State of Nevada on November 8, 2021, as amended on October 28, 2022.  Discover also absolutely and unconditionally waived and released any and all rights to convert all or any part of any Outstanding Notes previously executed by the Company in favor of Discover into shares of the Company’s common stock, and agreed not to convert or attempt to convert any portion of any Outstanding Notes, at any particular price or at all.

Series C Preferred Stock Corrections and Amendments

On December 14, 2020, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company and the sole holder of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, filed a certificate of corrections with the Secretary of State of Nevada to correct the original designation of the Series C Preferred Stock and the first amended and restated designation thereof, to correct certain errors which were identified in such designations, which failed to clarify, in error, that (A) the failure of any holder of Series C Preferred Stock to receive the number of shares of common stock due upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock within five trading days of any conversion notice, and any halt or suspension of trading of the Company’s common stock on its then applicable trading market or by any U.S. governmental agency, for 10 or more consecutive trading days, should not have been ‘deemed liquidation events’ under the Series C Preferred Stock designation, unless such events were due to the occurrence of an event that is solely within the control of the Company; (B) the Company was not required to redeem any shares of Series C Preferred Stock for cash solely because the Company does not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to issue upon receipt of a notice of conversion or upon a maturity conversion (where the remaining shares of Series C Preferred Stock convert into common stock of the Company automatically on the seven year anniversary date of the Series C Preferred Stock)(a “Maturity Conversion”); and (C) that a Maturity Conversion is only required to occur to the extent that the Company has sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance upon conversion in connection therewith. The corrections were made solely to match the agreements to the original intent of the parties. The parties determined the corrections were needed because without such corrections, under ASC 480- 10- S99-3A5 and ASC 480-10-S99-3A3(f), the non-corrected designations required the Series C Preferred Stock to be classified as temporary equity due to the foregoing events being outside the Company’s control. However, the corrections failed to remove all redemption provisions that were outside the control of the Company. Therefore, the Series C Preferred Stock remained in temporary equity. The embedded conversion meets the requirements to be considered a derivative liability as stipulated under ASC 815-40-25, under an assessment of the conversion premium as a freestanding instrument.

The corrections were effective as of the original filing dates with the Secretary of State of Nevada of the Company’s original Series C Preferred Stock designation (August 25, 2016) and the Company’s first amended and restated Series C Preferred Stock designation (July 8, 2019), subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

Also on December 14, 2020, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company and the sole holder of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, filed a second amended and restated designation of the Series C Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Nevada which was effective upon filing (the “Second Amended and Restated Designation”), which amended the first amended and restated designation of the Series C Preferred Stock (as corrected), to include the right of the Company to redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 110% of the face value of such preferred stock ($10,000 per share), at the Company’s option, at any time, in the event the Company is not in default of any of the terms of any Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which such applicable shares of Series C Preferred Stock were sold; (b) formally amend the measurement period for the calculation of the conversion premiums (the “Measurement Period”) due under the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock to begin on the later of February 3, 2020 or, if no trigger event (as described in the designation of the Series C Preferred Stock) has occurred, 30 trading days, and if a trigger event has occurred 60 trading days, before the date of an applicable conversion notice, which had previously been agreed to contractually by the parties (i.e., the beginning of each future measurement period for conversions made after February 3, 2020, will extend back to February 3, 2020); and (c) update the references in the designation to the “Merger” which had previously referred to the Company’s combination with Lineal Star Holdings, LLC, which transaction was rescinded and terminated effective December 31, 2019, to refer to the planned merger with Viking, which has the effect of the Viking merger being approved by the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock and not being a ‘deemed liquidation event’ under the Second Amended and Restated Designation.

On April 14, 2021, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company and the holders of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, filed a certificate of correction with the Secretary of State of Nevada to correct the original designation of the Series C Preferred Stock, the first amended and restated designation, and the second amended and restated designation thereof to correct certain errors which were identified in such designations, which failed to clarify, in error, that (A) Section I.D.2(e) of the original Certificate of Designation (the “Designation”) implicitly excluded as “Deemed Liquidation Event,” an event or proposal that was initiated by or voted upon by the holder of the Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Shares”), and the Designation has been clarified to expressly exclude such occurrence, (B) Section I.F.4 of the Designation failed to include language to clarify the Corporation is not obligated to redeem the Preferred Shares for cash for any reason that is not solely within the control of the Corporation, (C) Section 1.G.1 of the Designation mistakenly included two subsection b’s where only one was intended, and the unintended subsection b. has been removed, (D) Section I.G.1(e) of the Designation failed to include language to clarify that the Corporation not having sufficient authorized but unissued shares, solely within the control of the Corporation and excluding any event that is not solely within the control of the Corporation, is not a reason that would otherwise trigger the obligations in such section, (E) Sections I.G.1(f) and (g) of the Designation failed to include language to clarify the particular obligations apply only if the Corporation has sufficient authorized and unissued shares, (F) Section I.G.7.e of the Designation mistakenly referenced the incorrect Conversion Price, (G) Section 1.G.9 of the Designation failed to include language to clarify the maximum number of common shares that could be potentially issuable with respect to all conversions and other events that are not solely within the control of the Corporation, that the Dividend Maturity Date is to be indefinitely extended and suspended until sufficient authorized and unissued shares become available, the number of shares required to settle the excess obligation is fixed on the date that net share settlement occurs and that all provisions of the Designation are to be interpreted so that net share settlement is within the control of the Corporation.

The corrections were effective as of the original filing dates with the Secretary of State of Nevada of the Company’s original Series C Preferred Stock designation (August 25, 2016) and the Company’s first amended and restated Series C Preferred Stock designation (July 8, 2019), and the Company’s second amended and restated Series C Preferred Stock designation (December 14, 2020), subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

On April 20, 2021, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company and the holders of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, filed a third amended and restated designation of the Series C Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Nevada (the “Third Amended and Restated Designation”), which amended the Designations to state that dividends and conversion premiums will only be paid in shares of Company common stock, and state that redemption amounts will only be paid in shares of Company common stock. On July 10, 2021, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company and the holders of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, filed an amendment to its designation of its Series C Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Nevada (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Designation”), solely to increase the number of preferred shares designated as Series C Preferred Stock from 5,000 to 5,200.

On November 8, 2021, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada a Fifth Amended and Restated Designation regarding its Series C Preferred Stock which amended the Designations to provide voting rights to holders of the Series C Preferred Stock as required by the October 2021 Agreements (as defined herein).

On October 31, 2022, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada an amendment to the COD (the “Amendment), dated as of October 28, 2022 (the “Amendment Date”), pursuant to agreements between the Company and each of Discover and Antilles signed on October 28, 2022, which amended the COD such that (i) beginning on the Amendment Date and thereafter, when determining the conversion rate for each share of Series C Preferred Stock based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) over a certain number of previous days (“Measurement Period”), no day will be added to what would otherwise have been the end of any Measurement Period for the failure of the Equity Condition (as defined in the COD), even if the volume weighted average trading price (“Measuring Metric”) is not at least $1.50 and each Investor waived the right to receive any additional shares of Common Stock that might otherwise be due if such Equity Condition were to apply after the Agreement Date, including with respect to any pending Measurement Period; and (ii) (A) beginning on the Amendment Date and for the period through December 30, 2022, the Measuring Metric will be the higher of the amount provided in Section I.G.7.1(ii) of the COD and $0.20, and (B) beginning at market close on December 30, 2022 and thereafter, the Measuring Metric will be the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock on any day of trading following the date of first issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock.

 Amendments to Articles Regarding Common Shares

Effective on April 16, 2020, with the approval of the Company’s stockholders at its April 16, 2020 special meeting of stockholders, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common stock to 25 million shares of common stock. Effective on February 23. 2021, with the approval of the Company’s stockholders at its February 23, 2021 special meeting of stockholders, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common stock to 250 million shares of common stock.

17


On December 30, 2021, the Company filed an amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation to effect a proposal approved at a Special Meeting of Stockholders on December 30, 2021 whereby the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 250,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.

Recent Reverse Stock Split and Amendments to Articles

On December 14, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a one-for-fifty (1-for-50) reverse stock split of the Company’s (a) authorized shares of common stock; and (b) issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 12:01 a.m. Central Standard Time on December 21, 2022, and was reflected with the NYSE American and in the marketplace at the open of business on December 21, 2022 (the “Effective Date”).  As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each of the holders of the Company’s Common Stock received one (1) new share of Common Stock for every fifty (50) shares such shareholder held immediately prior. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the next whole number of shares. The Reverse Stock Split decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1,000,000,000 to 20,000,000.  The Reverse Stock Split also affected the Company’s outstanding stock options, warrants and other exercisable or convertible instruments and resulted in the shares underlying such instruments being reduced and the exercise price being increased proportionately to the Reverse Stock Split ratio. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented to reflect the effects of the Reverse Stock Split as if it had taken place as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Industry Segments 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operations were all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. 

Regulation 

Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining hazard prevention, health and safety plans; submitting notification and receiving permits related to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and natural gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface plugging and abandonment of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally limiting the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to possibly limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.

In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies issue recommended new and extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and natural gas drilling, natural gas processing plants and production activities, increasing the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Insomuch as new legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is common-place and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we may be unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have historically been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.


18

Insurance Matters 

We maintain insurance coverage which we believe is reasonable per the standards of the oil and natural gas industry. It is common for companies in these industries to not insure fully against all risks associated with their operations either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain insurance at industry customary levels to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law.
Other Matters

Environmental. Our exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, including our operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil, natural gas, and disposal wells. Our domestic activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as state regulations promulgated under comparable state statutes. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive materials that are found in our oil and gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, and impose substantial liabilities for cleanup of pollution.

Under the OPA, a release of oil into water or other areas designated by the statute could result in us being held responsible for the costs of remediating such a release, certain OPA specified damages, and natural resource damages. The extent of that liability could be extensive, as set forth in the statute, depending on the nature of the release. A release of oil in harmful quantities or other materials into water or other specified areas could also result in us being held responsible under the CWA for the costs of remediation, and civil and criminal fines and penalties.

CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as “Superfund” laws, can impose joint and several and retroactive liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. In practice, cleanup costs are usually allocated among various responsible parties. Potentially liable parties include site owners or operators, past owners or operators under certain conditions, and entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of, or transport hazardous substances found at the site. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum, including but not limited to, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, the exemption may not be preserved in future amendments of the act, if any.

RCRA and comparable state and local requirements impose standards for the management, including treatment, storage, and disposal, of both hazardous and non- hazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. From time to time, proposals have been made that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas wastes, including wastes generated during drilling, production and pipeline operations, as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA, which would make such solid wastes subject to much more stringent handling, transportation, storage, disposal, and clean-up requirements. This development could have a significant impact on our operating costs. While state laws vary on this issue, state initiatives to further regulate oil and natural gas wastes could have a similar impact. Because oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators, materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in some instances, require remediation. In addition, in certain instances, we have agreed to indemnify sellers of producing properties from which we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with such properties. While we do not believe that costs to be incurred by us for compliance and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, there can be no guarantee that such costs will not result in material expenditures.


19


Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil or other materials occur, and we incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. Moreover, we are able to control directly the operations of only those wells for which we act as the operator. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.

In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals are established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals would primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. We have used discounting to present value in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation or well closure, but no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our financial statements. We adjust the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

We do not anticipate being required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations, but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. More stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment may be adopted in the future and we may incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future.

Occupational Health and Safety. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of many of them, we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.

Hydraulic Fracturing. Vast quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil deposits exist in deep shale and other unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in deep underground formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. As with the rest of the industry, we use hydraulic fracturing as a means to increase the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. These formations are generally geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers. We follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) on federal acreage). Furthermore, our well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers.

Injection rates and pressures are required to be monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is required to be monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations are required to be shut down if an abrupt change occurs to the injection pressure or annular pressure. These aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to prevent a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations.

Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of water. We use fresh water or recycled produced water in our fracturing treatments in accordance with applicable water management plans and laws. Several proposals have previously been presented to the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states have previously considered, or are currently considering, legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so.


20


Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.

The Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to conduct construction activity could materially limit or delay our plans.
Global Warming and Climate Change. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and oil that we sell. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.
Taxation. Our operations, as is the case in the petroleum industry generally, are significantly affected by federal tax laws. Federal, as well as state, tax laws have many provisions applicable to corporations which could affect our future tax liabilities.
Commitments and Contingencies. We are liable for future restoration and abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties. These costs include future site restoration, post closure and other environmental exit costs. The costs of future restoration and well abandonment have not been determined in detail. State regulations require operators to post bonds that assure that well sites will be properly plugged and abandoned. We currently operate only in Texas, which requires a security bond based on the number of wells we operate. Management views this as a necessary requirement for operations and does not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial position as a result of this requirement.
Employees

The Company does not have any fulltime employees, but continues to retain outside consultants as needed, involved in business development, business analysis, financial consulting, web programming and designing, execution and support of the Company’s business.
