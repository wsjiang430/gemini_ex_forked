 Item 1.  Business.
 Our Business
 We are a clinical‑stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody and other protein therapeutics to treat severe and life‑threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. We are developing a suite of clinical-stage drug candidates from our proprietary XmAb® technology platforms that are designed to treat cancer, autoimmune and allergic diseases, and other conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches to antibody design, which focus on the portion of antibodies that interact with target antigens, our protein engineering efforts and the XmAb technologies are focused on the portion of the antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. This portion, referred to as the Fc domain, is constant and interchangeable among antibodies. Our engineered Fc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains. 
 We believe our Fc domains enhance antibody performance by, for example, increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half‑life, or stabilizing novel antibody and other protein structures, while maintaining 99.5% identity in structure and sequence to natural antibodies. By designing antibodies and other protein molecules with improved function, we believe that our XmAb‑engineered proteins offer innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantages over other treatments. In December 2018, the first antibody that incorporates an XmAb technology, ALXN1210, now Ultomiris™, was approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial marketing. Ultomiris™ is a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) that was developed by our partner Alexion, and incorporates our Xtend Fc technology which allows for a longer duration of action and less frequent dosing regimens compared to the previously approved therapy, Soliris®. 
  Our protein engineering capabilities allow us to continually explore new functionality in the Fc region, which provides us with opportunities to:

· | Identify new technology platforms;
--+-----------------------------------


· | Identify new drug candidates for internal development; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide collaboration and licensing opportunities with partners for access to our technologies, to our drug candidates, or a combination of both.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The most recent expansion of our platform is the XmAb bispecific Fc domains, which enable the rapid design and simplified development of antibodies and other protein structures that bind two or more different targets simultaneously.  Bispecifics are a rapidly emerging area of biotherapeutics development, particularly in oncology, and we are using our XmAb bispecific Fc domains as a robust scaffold to develop a pipeline of new bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates.

 Our business strategy is to leverage our bispecific Fc technology and Fc engineering capabilities to develop and advance a pipeline of oncology candidates. We believe that bispecific technologies and candidates will play a growing role in the field of oncology, and that our Fc capabilities and technologies position us to be a leader in this field. We will also continue to leverage our other XmAb drug candidates and Fc technologies through partnerships and collaborations.
 Since we began focusing our efforts in the bispecific field, we have advanced seven bispecific Fc candidates into development, expanded the functionality of the bispecific Fc technology, and entered into three collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies that will generate over $300 million in upfront payments. These collaborations provide us opportunities to co-develop drug candidates to leverage our partners’ capabilities and also to potentially earn substantial future revenue from potential milestones, royalties, and profit-sharing rights.
 XmAb Bispecific Fc Technology
 A distinguishing feature of our XmAb technologies is our modular approach to Fc engineering. This provides us with flexibility to seek out new functionality in the bispecific Fc domain, allows us to design drug candidates with distinct and novel mechanisms-of-action, and also allows for different variable target combinations. This approach is illustrated through our expansion of our bispecific Fc platform and the novel candidates that we have designed.
 CD3 bispecific candidates: the initial bispecific candidates that we designed were created with our engineered heterodimer Fc domain, or bispecific Fc domain, and are dual-antigen targeting molecules, containing an anti-tumor associated antigen binding domain and a second binding domain targeted to CD3, an activating receptor on T-cells. The goal of the “CD3 bispecific” is to recruit or activate T-cells against the antigen target. We are advancing three CD3 bispecific candidates through clinical development: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, and XmAb18087.
 Tumor microenvironment (TME) activator candidates: we expanded the functionality of our bispecific Fc platform with a suite of tumor microenvironment activators that have been designed to promote tumor-selective T-cell activation by targeting multiple checkpoints or co-stimulating receptors. These TME activator candidates use our bispecific Fc domain and incorporate our Xtend technology for longer half-life in their design. We are advancing three TME activator candidates through clinical development: XmAb20717, XmAb22841, and XmAb23104.
 Cytokine candidates: the most recent expansion of our bispecific Fc platform is our novel cytokine candidates. These cytokines are built on our bispecific Fc domain and have potency tuned to improve therapeutic index. These candidates also incorporate our Xtend technology for longer half-life. Our first cytokine candidate is XmAb24306, an IL-15/IL-15Ra cytokine complex built with our bispecific Fc domain. We believe that IL-15 cytokines, like XmAb24306, will be a promising candidate for oncology combination therapies.
 We continue to invest in our bispecific Fc engineering efforts to identify additional novel technologies and drug candidates.
 Other XmAb Fc Technologies
 Our business, research, and clinical efforts are in developing and advancing our bispecific Fc technology and pipeline of drug candidates in oncology. We have also designed additional Fc technologies and XmAb drug candidates that we have partnered with other companies, and we will seek to continue to license and partner to maximize their potential. Our Fc domains and technologies include:
1. | Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain – selective immune inhibition and rapid target clearance, targeting the receptor FcγRIIb;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Cytotoxic Fc Domain – increased cytotoxicity, targeting the receptors FcγRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells and FcγRIIa on other immune system cells; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Xtend™ Fc Domain – extended antibody half-life, targeting the receptor FcRn on endothelial cells.

 XmAb Bispecific Fc Drug Candidates
 There are currently seven bispecific candidates that have been engineered with our bispecific Fc domain through clinical or late preclinical development: four candidates are being evaluated in Phase 1 studies, two candidates have Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) that have been allowed by the FDA and for which we plan to initiate clinical trials in 2019, and one candidate for which we expect to submit an IND application to the FDA in 2019.
1. | XmAb14045 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD123, an antigen on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and leukemic stem cells, and CD3, a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain. It is being developed in collaboration with our partner Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (Novartis) and is being evaluated in a Phase 1 study. In September 2016, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb14045 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We presented initial data from the study in December 2018 at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. The data presented indicated multiple complete remissions had been achieved with weekly dosing of XmAb14045 in this heavily-pretreated patient population. 66 patients with relapsed/refractory AML received XmAb14045. Patients were a median age of 61 years and were heavily pretreated, having a median of three prior therapies, and 30% (n=20) had a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 86% of patients (n=57) were refractory to their last therapy, and 53% (n=35) were categorized as adverse risk at diagnosis by the European Leukemia Net system. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) had not been reached. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the most common toxicity occurring in 55% (n=36) of patients. 6% of patients (n=4) experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS. CRS was more severe on the initial dose and was generally manageable with premedication. Additional adverse events consistent with CRS but not reported as such, including chills, fever, tachycardia, hypotension and hypertension within 24 hours of infusion, were reported in an additional 29% of patients (n=19). 28% of evaluable patients (5 of 18) achieved either complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) at the two highest initial dose levels studied (1.3 and 2.3 mcg/kg weekly). 
 In February 2019, we received notice from the FDA placing the XmAb14045 study on partial clinical hold due to safety issues of cytokine release syndrome and pulmonary toxicities. Under the partial hold, existing subjects on the trial may continue to receive dosing; however, no new subjects may be enrolled pending FDA review of a clinical hold response. 
 The partial hold was initiated following recent safety reports Xencor submitted to the FDA on two patient deaths that were considered at least possibly related to XmAb14045. One patient experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after their first dose, the treatment of which was complicated by the patient’s decision to withdraw care. One subject developed acute pulmonary edema following several doses of XmAb14045. Items to be addressed in the response include analysis of CRS cases per dosing level, efficacy information, and strategies to mitigate the observed toxicities.  
 We are coordinating a response to the partial hold by the FDA with our partner, Novartis, and plan to continue development of XmAb14045 pending resolution of the partial hold.

2. | XmAb13676 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. In February 2017, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb13676 in patients with B-cell malignancies. This program was also partnered with Novartis as part of our Novartis collaboration. In December 2018, as part of a strategic pipeline reprioritization, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights to develop and commercialize XmAb13676, which is effective June 21, 2019. We intend to continue development of XmAb13676 as planned, and we expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 study in the second half of 2019.

3. | XmAb18087 is a bispecific antibody oncology candidate that targets somatostatin receptor 2, or SSTR2, a target on neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and CD3, an activating receptor on T-cells. In February 2018, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb18087 in patients with NET or GIST. XmAb18087 is our first CD3 bispecific antibody to be evaluated in solid tumors. We expect to provide initial data from this study in the second half of 2019.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | XmAb20717 is a bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and CTLA-4, two immune checkpoint receptors, to selectively activate the tumor microenvironment, and is being developed for broad oncology indications including patients with solid tumors. In July 2018, we dosed the first patient in an open-label Phase 1 dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb20717 in patients with selected solid tumors. We expect to provide initial data from this study in the second half of 2019.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | XmAb22841 is a bispecific antibody that targets CTLA-4 and LAG-3, also an immune checkpoint receptor, and is being developed for multiple indications. We intend to advance XmAb22841 in combination with an anti-PD-1 drug to create a triple checkpoint blockade. The FDA approved our IND application for this drug candidate in November 2018. We plan to dose patients in an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb22841 in patients with selected solid tumors, and we plan to dose the first patient in the first half of 2019.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | XmAb23104 is a bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and ICOS, an immune co-stimulatory receptor, and is being developed for multiple oncology indications. The FDA approved our IND application for this drug candidate in October 2018. We plan to dose patients in a an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb23104 in patients with selected solid tumors, and we plan to dose the first patient in the first half of 2019.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | XmAb24306 is an IL15/IL-15-receptor alpha complex fused to our bispecific Fc domain and incorporates our Xtend technology for extended half-life. We believe a broad combination development strategy will be critical to realize the potential of IL-15 cytokines. In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. (collectively Genentech), to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, whereby the companies will co-develop XmAb24306 and other potential IL-15 programs. XmAb24306 is conducting IND-enabling studies and Xencor will support Genentech’s efforts to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019.

  XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Candidates
 We have developed two clinical candidates using our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain:
 XmAb5871 uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and targets CD19 with its variable domain, which is designed to inhibit the function of B cells, an important component of the immune system. We believe that XmAb5871 has the potential to address a key unmet need in autoimmune diseases due to its combination of potent reversible B-cell inhibition without B-cell depletion, enabling the immune system to resume natural function once treatment is no longer needed. We have completed Phase 2 clinical trials for XmAb5871 in three autoimmune disease areas: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD), and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).
 SLE: in order to assess the effect of XmAb5871 on SLE disease activity in a shorter timeframe and enrolling fewer patients than standard SLE trials, we completed a Phase 2 study with a novel design that sought to reduce the confounding effects of background immunosuppressive medication.

 The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study enrolled 104 patients with moderate to severe, non-organ threatening SLE across 20 sites in the United States. Patients discontinued background immunosuppressive medication and received a short course of intramuscular steroids to quiet SLE disease activity. Patient lupus activity was evaluated using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) scoring. Patients achieving the required disease activity improvement (SLEDAI decrease ≥4 points, or ≥1 grade decrease in ≥1 BILAG A or B score) were randomized 1:1 to receive XmAb5871 (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52) every 14 days for up to 16 doses. 
 In October 2018, we presented topline data from the study at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with no loss of improvement (LOI) (i.e., maintenance of improvement) in the efficacy-evaluable population, defined as those who completed Day 225, had LOI, or discontinued due to a drug-related adverse event. LOI was defined as a SLEDAI increase ≥4 points or a new BILAG A or B score and physician intent to treat with rescue medication. Improvement was maintained at Day 225 by 42% of patients (21/50) in the XmAb5871-treated arm, compared to 28.6% of patients (12/42) in the placebo-treated arm, which did not meet the primary endpoint for statistical significance (p = 0.18). The efficacy-evaluable population excludes 10/52 (19%) placebo patients and 2/52 (4%) XmAb5871-treated patients who withdrew from the study for reasons other than LOI or adverse event. These exclusions resulted in higher placebo response rates compared to the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. In the ITT population, improvement was maintained by 40.4% of patients (21/52) in the XmAb5871-treated arm, compared to 23.1% of patients (12/52) in the placebo-treated arm which results in an improved statistical significance (p = 0.06).
 Secondary endpoints included evaluations of time to LOI and safety and tolerability of XmAb5871. Patients in the efficacy-evaluable population treated with XmAb5871 experienced a statistically significant longer time to LOI (median = 230 days, hazard ratio = 0.53, p = 0.025), compared to placebo-treated patients (median = 131 days), a 76% improvement in median time to LOI and a 47% reduction in risk of LOI. XmAb5871 was well tolerated, and its safety profile was consistent with previous trials.
 IgG4-RD: In November 2017, we presented final data from a Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 in patients with IgG4-RD at the ACR annual meeting for the 15 patients that had been enrolled and received one or more doses of 5 mg/kg of XmAb5871.  The data indicated that XmAb5871 was well tolerated by patients receiving drug in the study.  Three patients had minor, transient gastrointestinal side-effects during the first infusion; all completed the study. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) unrelated to XmAb5871 were observed in one patient, pneumonia and recurrence of pneumonia due to non-compliance with antibiotic therapy (patient completed study). All other XmAb5871-related adverse events (AEs) were graded as mild or moderate, and no treatment related AE was reported in more than two patients. Three patients discontinued the study early. 
 12 of the 15 patients (80%) completed the trial and all 12 achieved the primary endpoint of at least a 2-point reduction in IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI) on day 169. None of the 12 required corticosteroids (CS) after month two. Eight patients achieved remission (IgG4-RD RI of zero and no CS after two months) and the other four patients achieved an IgG4-RD Responder Index score of <=4 at Day 169. 14 of 15 patients (93%) achieved a decrease of ≥ 5 in the IgG4-RD RI. 
 In May 2017, we received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for XmAb5871 for the treatment of IgG4-RD. In January 2018, we received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Commission.
 RA: In June 2015, we announced results from a Phase 1b/2a placebo-controlled trial of XmAb5871 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results indicated that XmAb5871 was generally well tolerated. Although the trial was not designed to observe a statistically significant difference in efficacy results between XmAb5871 and placebo treated patients, sufficient efficacy trends were seen to warrant continued clinical development of XmAb5871 in autoimmune indications. A numerically increased proportion of patients with improvements across several measurements of disease activity were observed in the XmAb5871 treated groups compared to placebo.

 Subcutaneous bioequivalence: In October 2016, we completed a Phase 1 bioequivalence trial for XmAb5871 using a subcutaneous (SC) formulation. XmAb5871 had a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated. Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability data from the trial support an every-other-week dosing schedule, and we expect that further clinical studies will be conducted with XmAb5871 in a SC formulation. 
 We believe that the clinical trials that we have conducted with XmAb5871 show the potential of this molecule in treating B-cell mediated autoimmune indications. We are looking to continue developing XmAb5871 in additional late-stage clinical trials with a partner that has the resources and infrastructure to maximize the potential of this compound. 
 XmAb7195 uses our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and targets IgE with its variable domain, and this drug candidate is being developed for the treatment of severe asthma and allergic diseases. XmAb7195 uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum levels of IgE, which mediates allergic responses and allergic disease.  
 In January 2015, we reported top-line interim data from Part 1 of the Phase 1a trial of XmAb7195, in which healthy volunteers received a single intravenous (IV) dose. In 2015, we continued the Phase 1a trial of XmAb7195, treating subjects with high baseline IgE levels, and in June 2015, we announced an expansion of the trial, adding cohorts of subjects that receive two IV doses of XmAb7195. We announced complete data from these studies in May 2016. 
 In September 2016, we initiated a multi-dose Phase 1b trial for XmAb7195 with a SC formulation. The first part of this study was an open-label bioequivalence trial evaluating four once-weekly doses of SC XmAb7195 ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg in cohorts of six healthy volunteers. The second part of the trial, which we began in October 2016, was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose study in atopic patients of SC XmAb7195 at doses of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg.  Half-life of SC XmAb7195 ranged from 3.6 - 4.9 days, comparable to the previously reported half-life of 3.9 days of intravenously administered XmAb7195.  Bioavailability after the fourth dose exceeded 50%, which is typical for monoclonal antibodies, and drug concentration levels increased with successive doses.
 SC administration of XmAb7195 was well tolerated. No severe AEs or serious treatment-emergent AEs occurred during the study. The most frequently occurring treatment-emergent AEs were injection-site related, including erythema, pruritus and/or urticaria, and most were mild.  No diffuse urticaria or other systemic hypersensitivity reactions were reported. No apparent consistent effect of SC XmAb7195 on platelet count was seen when dosed at 0.1 - 1.0 mg/kg weekly for four weeks.  At 1.5 - 2.0 mg/kg weekly for four weeks mild platelet count reductions were observed. Four of 15 patients in the 2.0 mg/kg group had at least one platelet count of less than 150 x 103/L at some time point.  The lowest count observed was 126 x 103/L, and a recovery to within normal range occurred within a few days of the doses.  
 In 23 of 27 (85%) subjects with detectable baseline free IgE (≥ 9.59 ng/mL) (median 76.2 ng/mL, range: 17.4-846 ng/mL), treated with four weekly SC XmAb7195 doses of 0.3 to 2.0 mg/kg, free IgE was suppressed to below the level of quantification (BLQ) at some time point during the treatment period. In 20 of the 27 (74%) subjects, once suppression of free IgE to BLQ was observed, BLQ values were maintained for the remainder of the treatment period and for at least seven days following the last dose. Similarly, in the subgroup of atopic subjects, 14 of 14 (100%) subjects with detectable baseline free IgE (median 150.0 ng/mL, range: 46.4-846 ng/mL) treated with four weekly SC XmAb7195 doses of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg, free IgE was suppressed to BLQ at some time point during the treatment period. In 12 (86%) atopic subjects, once suppression of free IgE to BLQ was observed, BLQ values were maintained for the remainder of the treatment period and for at least seven days following the last dose.

 In 28 of 31 (90%) subjects with detectable baseline total IgE (≥ 2.0 IU/mL) (median 68.1 IU/mL, range: 7.13-736 IU/mL) treated with four weekly SC XmAb7195 doses of 0.3 to 2.0 mg/kg, total IgE was suppressed to BLQ at some time point during the treatment period. In the other three subjects, total IgE levels were reduced to < 1% of baseline values. In 23 of 28 (82%) subjects, once suppression of total IgE to BLQ was observed, BLQ values were maintained for the remainder of the treatment period and for at least seven days following the last dose. Similarly, in the subgroup of atopic subjects, 12 of 14 (86%) subjects with detectable baseline total IgE (median 153.5 IU/mL, range: 38.9-736.0 IU/mL) treated with four weekly SC XmAb7195 doses of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg, total IgE was suppressed to BLQ at some time point during the treatment period. In the other two atopic subjects, total IgE levels were reduced to < 1% of baseline values. In eight of 12 (67%) subjects once suppression of free IgE to BLQ was observed, BLQ values were maintained for the remainder of the treatment period and for at least seven days following the last dose. In three of the other four atopic subjects that had suppression of total IgE level to BLQ, subsequent total IgE levels through seven days after the fourth dose were < 2% of baseline values.
 These results support SC delivery for future development, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling is proceeding to determine the optimal dosing schedule. Xencor is seeking a partner for continued development of XmAb7195.
 Collaborations
 An important part of our business strategy is to leverage the value of our bispecific Fc technologies and drug candidates with partnerships and collaborations. Our goal in such partnerships is to a retain a major economic interest in drug candidates that we develop or, are developed with our bispecific technologies, in the form of retention of U.S. commercial rights, profit-sharing interest, co-development opportunities, upfront payments, milestones, and potential royalties on approved drug candidates. We seek to partner with companies that can provide infrastructure for late stage development, have a track record of developing and commercializing oncology drug candidates, or have a pipeline of development and commercial compounds for potential combination with our bispecific compounds.  The plug-and-play nature of our technologies allows us to license access to our bispecific Fc platform to partners with limited effort or resources on our part. We are co-developing two of our current drug candidates with partners, another partner has advanced into development two candidates that have been designed using our bispecific Fc technology, and there are others in preclinical development.
 Our bispecific collaborations include:
  Genentech   
In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech (the Genentech Agreement) to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics that use our bispecific Fc technology, including XmAb24306, and other Collaboration Products, in the areas of cancer immunotherapy. We will jointly collaborate on the worldwide development of XmAb24306 and other IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, each a Collaboration Product, with Genentech maintaining worldwide commercialization rights, subject to us having a co-promotion option in the U.S. We retained the right to perform clinical studies of Collaboration Products in combination with other therapeutic agents, subject to certain requirements. Genentech received a worldwide exclusive license to XmAb24306 and other Collaboration Products. The key aspects of the agreement include:
· | We will receive an upfront payment of $120 million and are eligible to receive up to $160 million in clinical milestone payments for each Collaboration Product that advances to Phase 3 clinical trials,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are eligible to receive a 45% share of net profits from sales of XmAb24306 and Collaboration Products, while also sharing in the net losses at the same percentage rate,

· | We will conduct a two-year joint research program with Genentech to discover additional programs around the IL-15 cytokine technology and will receive a $20 million milestone payment upon the initiation of each Phase 1 clinical trial for each new Collaboration Product developed under a research plan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Genentech Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and closing is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019.
 We believe that the Genentech collaboration maximizes the potential value of our XmAb24306 candidate and other potential Collaboration Products. 
  Novartis    In June 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the Novartis Agreement) with Novartis to develop and commercialize bispecific and other Fc engineered antibody drug candidates. Key aspects to the agreement include:

· | We received a $150 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive up to $2.1 billion in milestone payments,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We granted Novartis certain exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, our two lead bispecific clinical candidates. In December 2018, Novartis returned all their rights to XmAb13676 to us,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are eligible to receive up to $325 million in milestone payments in connection with the development of XmAb14045, including $90 million in development milestones, $110 million in regulatory milestones, and $125 million in sales milestones. We are also eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on sales of approved products in all territories outside the United States (ex-U.S. rights). We retained the commercialization rights to all XmAb14045 candidates in the U.S., 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We and Novartis are co-developing XmAb14045 worldwide and sharing development costs equally. Novartis is also obligated to fund its share of development costs for XmAb13676 through June 2020,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will also apply our bispecific technology to up to four target pair antibodies selected by Novartis, if such target pairs are available for exclusive license to Novartis and are not subject to a Xencor internal program. Novartis will assume full responsibility for development and commercialization of each product candidate under each of these global discovery programs. Assuming successful development and commercialization of each global discovery program compound, we could receive up to $250.0 million in milestone payments for each global discovery program which includes $50.0 million in development milestones, $100.0 million in regulatory milestones, and $100.0 million in sales milestones. If commercialized, we are eligible to receive mid-single digit royalties on global net sales of approved products,

  XmAb Licensing and Technology Partnerships
 There are currently four partnerships with XmAb candidates in development.
  Alexion    In 2013 we licensed Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) the right to access our Xtend Fc domain and Alexion incorporated it in developing Ultomiris, an improved version of Alexion’s commercialized Soliris product. The Xtend technology has increased the half-life of Ultomiris by over three fold compared to Soliris and extended the dosing schedule to bimonthly for Ultomiris compared to biweekly for Soliris. 
 In 2018, Alexion submitted marketing authorization applications for Ultomiris to the regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe and Japan; for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and in December 2018, Alexion received FDA approval. During 2018, we received $20.0 million in milestone payments from this partnership and to date we have received a cumulative total of $37.5 million in milestone and upfront payments. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $38.0 million in regulatory and sales milestones, and royalties on the sale of approved products in the low single-digit percent range.
  MorphoSys    In June 2011 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the MorphoSys Agreement) with MorphoSys AG (MorphoSys) to license the worldwide rights to XmAb5574 (now known as MOR208). MOR208 is an antibody drug candidate originally developed by us and it incorporates our XmAb cytotoxic Fc domain.

 MorphoSys is currently conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of MOR208 in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and a Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MorphoSys has indicated that it has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for targeting diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in combination with lenalidomide. MorphoSys has indicated it will be submitting MOR208 for regulatory approval in 2019.  
  We have received a total of $28.5 million in upfront and milestone payments under the MorphoSys Agreement and we are eligible to receive additional milestones for development of the MorphoSys compounds in oncology and additional milestones for development of compounds in different indications. Total additional milestones for MorphoSys compounds currently in development total $111 million which include: $6 million in development milestones, $55 million in regulatory milestones, and $50 million of aggregate milestone payments for the achievement of certain product sales goals. If licensed products are commercialized, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the high single‑digit to low‑double digit percent range. 
 The term of this agreement will continue until all of MorphoSys’ royalty payment obligations have expired unless terminated earlier. 
  CSL
 In February 2009, we entered into a research license and commercialization agreement (CSL Agreement) with CSL Limited (CSL) in which we provided CSL with a research license to our cytotoxic Fc technology and options to non-exclusive commercial licenses.  CSL elected to exercise one commercial license for a compound, CSL362.
 In 2013 CSL sublicensed CSL362 to Janssen Biotech Inc. (Janssen Biotech). In August 2015, CSL, through its sublicensee, Janssen Biotech, initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for CSL362. In March 2017, Janssen Biotech initiated a Phase 3 trial for CSL362 and we received a milestone payment of $3.5 million. In July 2017, Janssen discontinued the Phase 3 trial for CSL362 and returned the compound to CSL. 
  Boehringer Ingelheim
 In February 2007, we entered into a research and option agreement (BI Agreement) with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (BI). Under the terms of the BI Agreement we provided a research license to our XmAb cytotoxic technology and options to non-commercial licenses. BI elected to take options to two licenses and there is currently one compound in a Phase 1 clinical trial.   NIH
 In January 2016, we announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of VRC01LS, a therapeutic antibody for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that uses our Xtend technology to enhance antibody half-life. VRC01LS is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted to the CD4 binding site of HIV-1. VRC01LS is a modification of the VRC01 monoclonal antibody, which demonstrated a suppression of HIV viral load in a Phase 1 trial conducted by NIH. NIH has not entered into an agreement with us for this technology.

 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing engineered monoclonal antibodies and other proteins in oncology to treat patients with severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to: 
1. | Advance the clinical development of our bispecific Fc domain development candidates. Our XmAb bispecific technology allows us the opportunity to rapidly develop multiple antibody drug candidates with dual targeting mechanisms for the treatment of various cancers including solid tumors. We have initiated Phase 1 trials for four bispecific oncology candidates, XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, and XmAb20717, and we will be initiating Phase 1 clinical trials for two candidates, XmAb23014 and XmAb22841, in the first half of 2019. We are in preclinical development for our first bispecific Fc domain cytokine candidate, XmAb24306, and plan to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Build a large and diversified portfolio of product candidates. We aim to create new XmAb-engineered antibody product candidates that exploit the novel properties of our XmAb technology platform for preclinical and clinical development by us or, if appropriate, license certain candidates to leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Continue to monetize and expand the use of our XmAb technology platform. We continuously seek opportunities to maximize the value of our XmAb technologies and will selectively license access to certain of the technologies to leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in their proprietary programs. In 2019, we announced a collaboration agreement with Genentech and we are eligible to receive an upfront payment of $120 million, milestone payments of $160 million per program developed under the agreement, and a 45% share of net profits on global net sales of products. In 2016, we received $150 million upfront in connection with the Novartis Agreement and are eligible to receive up to $2.41 billion in potential milestone payments. In 2018, we received $20 million in milestone payments from our partner Alexion. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Broaden the functionality of our XmAb technology platform. We are conducting further research into the function and application of antibody Fc domains in order to expand the scope of our XmAb technology platform. Our bispecific technology, which uses our heterodimeric Fc domain enabling molecules with dual target binding, is an example of the expanding functionality of our XmAb technology platform. We expanded the functionality of the bispecific platform with the development of a series of tumor microenvironment (TME) activator drug candidates and the first bispecific Fc domain cytokine candidate, XmAb24306. Both the TME activator and cytokine candidates incorporate our Xtend Fc technology for longer duration of action. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Continue to expand our patent portfolio protecting our XmAb technology platform. We seek to expand and protect our development programs and product candidates by filing and prosecuting patents in the United States and other countries. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Research and Development Pipeline
 We have used our XmAb Fc platforms and antibody optimization capabilities to produce a growing pipeline of drug candidates in clinical and preclinical development. These include multiple oncology candidates using our bispecific Fc domain, including CD3 candidates, TME activator checkpoint, and cytokine candidates, and drug candidates using our immune inhibitor Fc domain. We will continue to progress these candidates as additional options for clinical development by us or as out‑licensing opportunities.  We also from time to time in-license antibody technologies and compounds from other companies which we believe may allow us to create potential product candidates by incorporating our XmAb technology.  These licenses may require us to pay up-front fees, development and commercial milestone payments, and if commercial products are approved, royalties on net sales.

  Market Opportunity
 Our drug candidates that use the XmAb bispecific Fc domain, including XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, and XmAb24306: We are pursuing the development of our bispecific Fc candidates for applications in oncology, whereby the immune system is modulated to treat cancer. Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body, and it is the second leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.). The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2018 there were approximately 1.7 million new cases of cancer and approximately 609,000 deaths from cancer. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that based on growth and aging of the U.S. population, medical expenditures for cancer in the year 2020 are projected to reach at least $158 billion (in 2010 dollars). 
 XmAb5871: We have advanced development of XmAb5871 through Phase 2 trials for SLE, IgG4-RD, and other autoimmune diseases. The unmet need in SLE remains high for the estimated 240,000 Americans with a lupus diagnosis. SLE is a serious and potentially fatal disease that primarily affects women. It is an autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels and brain. Patients are often subject to prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and potent immunosuppressive agents with significant short and long term side effects.  Current biologic treatments are limited by their modest efficacy or safety risks. Because B cells play a significant role in SLE pathogenesis, we believe that XmAb5871is a potential treatment. IgG4-RD is a fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that we estimate impacts approximately 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and we believe is characterized by the distinct pathologies in diseased organs, frequently including the presence of IgG4-positive plasma blast cells. There are currently no approved therapies for IgG4-RD and glucocorticoids (hormone steroids) are the current standard of care treatment.
 XmAb7195: The potential indication for which we are currently pursuing XmAb7195 development is allergic asthma. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma affects approximately one in 12 Americans. More than half of asthma sufferers have at least one attack each year and thousands of people die from asthma attacks each year. Disease severities cover a wide range, and the treatment landscape is multi-tiered for asthma patients. Patients with mild and moderate asthma are generally well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists. However, a small percentage of the estimated 25 million asthma patients in the U.S. have severe asthma and are refractory to high-dose combination therapy. This severe population is commonly treated with oral corticosteroids, which are associated with many undesirable side effects and are often insufficient to control the disease.
 Intellectual Property
 The foundation for our XmAb technology and our product candidates and partnering is the generation and protection of intellectual property for novel antibody therapeutics. We combine proprietary computational methods for amino acid sequence design with laboratory generation and testing of new antibody compositions. Our design and engineering team prospectively assesses, with patent counsel, the competitive landscape with the goal of building broad patent positions and avoiding third-party intellectual property. 
 As a pioneer in Fc domain engineering, we systematically scanned the structure of the Fc domain to discover Fc variants. We have filed patent applications relating to thousands of specific Fc domain variants with experimental data on specific improvements of immune function, pharmacokinetics, structural stability, and novel structural constructs. We have filed additional patent applications derived from these applications as we discover new properties of the Fc variants and as new business opportunities arise. We continually seek to expand the intellectual property coverage of our technology and candidates, and invest in discovering new Fc domain technologies and antibody product candidates. 
 Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes over 750 issued patents and pending patent applications which we own or for which we have a fully-paid exclusive license, with claims directed to XmAb Fc domains, all of our clinical and preclinical stage antibodies and our computational protein design methods and platforms. We also have a large number of issued patents and pending patent applications with claims directed specifically to our XmAb technology and candidates.

XmAb24306 | 2037 U.S. and Ex-U.S. 

      In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We seek to protect this intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of certain discoveries or inventions made by them. 
 Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We have obtained registrations for the Xencor trademark, as well as certain other trademarks, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our clinical-stage products, including XmAb, PDA and Protein Design Automation. We currently have registrations for Xencor and PDA in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Community, and Japan, for Protein Design Automation in the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Community, and for XmAb in the United States, Australia, and the European Community.
  Manufacturing
 We are able to internally manufacture the quantities of our product candidates required for relatively short preclinical animal studies. We believe that this allows us to accelerate the drug development process by not having to rely on third parties for all of our manufacturing needs.  We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) for the manufacture of drug substance and product, including our pipeline of bispecific development candidates and also our XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 development candidates. We have used third party manufacturers for all our bispecific Fc candidates which include: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, and XmAb24306. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This allows us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on developing our products. XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 are produced by mammalian cell culture of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses the antibody, followed by multiple purification and filtration steps typical of those used for monoclonal antibodies. We do not have any long-term manufacturing agreements in place and will ultimately depend on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products for commercial sale, as well as for process development.  We have successfully completed clinical trials with subcutaneous formulations for both XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 which have been manufactured with third party contract manufacturers.

  17

 

 We have also entered into separate cell line sale agreements (Cell Line Agreements) with Catalent for the XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 cell lines. Catalent manufactured the cell lines for the XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 programs using their proprietary GPEx® technology. Under the Catalent Manufacturing Agreement, we have an unrestricted license to the GPEx cell lines provided that Catalent is manufacturing drug substance material from the cell line. The Cell Line Agreements allow us to transfer the manufacturing processes for either XmAb5871 or XmAb7195 to a third party manufacturer.  In 2018, we transferred the manufacturing process for XmAb5871 from Catalent to a third party manufacturer.
 Upon transfer of the XmAb5817 or XmAb7195 cell line to a third party manufacturer, we will be required to make payments to Catalent based upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and will also pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales for products that are derived from or utilize the GPEx cell line. The royalty percentages under each Cell Line Agreement are less than 1.0%. In 2017, we transferred the cell line for XmAb5871 to a third party manufacturer. We have not made any payments under the Cell Line Agreement to date.

We have the unilateral right to terminate the Catalent Manufacturing Agreement upon 30 days written notice to Catalent. Absent early termination, the agreement will remain in effect. If we terminate the agreement without cause or if Catalent terminates the agreement for our material breach of the agreement, our ownership rights in the cell line will automatically terminate, and title will revert to Catalent.
  Master Bioprocessing Services Agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies

In June 2017, we entered into a bioprocessing services agreement (FUJI Agreement) with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A. (FUJI). We have engaged FUJI under the FUJI Agreement for manufacturing and development services related to drug substance for our XmAb5871 program in accordance with cGMP regulations. The FUJI Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach or default that is not remedied within 45 days or for an additional 45 days if such cure has commenced by the responsible party but it is unable to cure it within the original 45-day notice period.  If such cure is not completed within the 90-day period, we have the right to terminate the FUJI Agreement. We have the unilateral right to terminate the Agreement upon 30 days written notice to FUJI.  Competition
 We compete in an industry that is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and other research organizations. We compete with these parties for promising targets for antibody‑based therapeutics, new technology for optimizing antibodies, and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities as well as greater financial, marketing and sales, and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance. In addition, our competitors’ products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize, and may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
 Competition in the field of cancer drug development is intense, with more than 250 compounds in clinical trials by large multinational pharmaceutical companies. We are aware of companies with competing bispecific technologies including Amgen, MacroGenics, Inc. (MacroGenics), Merus, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. (Roche), Genentech, and Zymeworks, Inc. Several companies have competing bispecific molecules as both Roche and Regeneron have CD20 x CD 3 candidates in Phase 1 development and MacroGenics has a CD123 x CD3 bispecific antibody in clinical development . The field of oncology has multiple large pharmaceutical companies with competing oncology programs including Bristol Myers-Squib, Merck & Co., and Roche. In addition, we are aware of a number of other companies with development stage programs that may compete with the drug candidates we and our licensees are developing in the future. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.

 Regulatory Overview
 Our business and operations are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local and foreign supranational, national, provincial and municipal laws, regulations and trade practices. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of drugs and biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of our product candidates. U.S. Government Regulation
 U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), its implementing regulations, and other laws including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our antibody product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1. | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s current good clinical practices (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of a BLA;
---+--------------------------------------------------


5. | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection (if the FDA deems it as a requirement) of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | potential audits by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | potential review of the BLA by an external Advisory Committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  19

 

 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. The FDA or responsible Institutional Review Board may place a trial on hold at any time related to perceived risks to patient safety.

1. | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects, or in some cases, patients with the disease for which the drug candidate is intended, and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.

2. | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population (but larger than in Phase 1) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population (such as several hundred to several thousand) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.

  Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The standard time for the FDA to accept a BLA filing is two months.
 If the FDA determines that the BLA is substantially complete, it will accept the BLA for filing.  
 Once accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and it may inspect the manufacturing facilities to assure cGMP compliance and clinical sites used during the clinical trials to assure cGMP compliance. The standard FDA review process is 10 months once a BLA is accepted for review but it can take longer. During the review process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS prior to approval. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.

 The FDA will issue a complete response letter describing deficiencies in the BLA and recommend actions if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The applicant will have to address all of the deficiencies which could take substantial time to address. 
 If the product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, and may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Any biologic products for which we or our collaborators receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance for product manufacture, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct‑to‑consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”), industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as product reclass, warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties, or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of any of our biologic product candidates, we may apply for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for one patent per product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process of that product. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products generally not earlier than 12 years after the original BLA approval. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to existing brand product. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.

 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Significant uncertainty exists and will continue to exist as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Formulary placement by third-party payors is very competitive and can lead to lower prices and may effectively restrict patient access to our drugs. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. In the United States, there has been heightened government scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of products under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, at the federal level,  on May 11, 2018,  President Trump laid out his administration’s “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. Although some of these and other proposals may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislation and/or administrative measures to control pharmaceutical costs. In other countries, pricing and reimbursement schemes differ. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been and will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, once they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

 For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act) is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. In addition, other reform measures have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted.
 Additional new laws may result in additional reductions in funding to Medicare and other healthcare programs and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and our financial operations. Further, new laws may, among other things, increase drug rebates or discounts owed under federal health care programs, impose additional reporting or compliance obligations, and/or otherwise put additional downward pressure on drug prices or increase the burden of compliance on pharmaceutical manufacturers.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, as amended, the federal civil False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted anti-kickback statues and false claims laws analogous to the federal civil False Claims Act. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to the delivery of or payments for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations also established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their “business associates” (individuals and entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. In addition, we may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, additional oversight and reporting obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we, and our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products, similar or more stringent than the U.S. laws.
 Whether or not we, or our collaborators, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we and our collaborators may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti‑kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the European Union’s Directive 95/46 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.
 If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
  Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 156 employees, all of whom were full‑time, 46 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 128 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 28 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support.
