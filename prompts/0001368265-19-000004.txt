Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are the leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets in the United States and Canada, based on the number of stations operated and the amount of gasoline gallon equivalents (“GGEs”) of RNG, CNG and LNG delivered. 
Our principal business is supplying RNG, CNG and LNG (RNG can be delivered in the form of CNG or LNG) for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and providing operation and maintenance (“O&M”) services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations. As a comprehensive solution provider, we also design, build, operate and maintain fueling stations; sell and service natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations and LNG stations; offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets; transport and sell CNG and LNG via “virtual” natural gas pipelines and interconnects; procure and sell RNG; sell tradable credits we generate by selling RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel, including RIN Credits and LCFS Credits; help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles; and obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives. In addition, before March 31, 2017, we produced RNG at our own production facilities (which we sold, along with certain of our other RNG production assets to BP Products North America (“BP”), in a transaction we refer to as the “BP Transaction”), and before December 29, 2017, we manufactured natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations (which we combined with SAFE S.p.A., the natural gas fueling compressor subsidiary of Landi Renzo S.p.A. (“LR”) in a newly formed company, in a transaction we refer to as the “CEC Combination”). 
We serve fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users, and government fleets. We believe these fleet markets will continue to present a growth opportunity for natural gas vehicle fuel for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2018, we serve over 1,000 fleet customers operating over 47,000 natural gas vehicles, and we own, operate or supply approximately 530 natural gas fueling stations in 41 states in the United States and four provinces in Canada. We estimate this number of stations is approximately three times the number of CNG fueling stations operated by our largest competitor in today’s market, and we believe our natural gas fueling operations cover more states and provinces than any of our competitors. We believe we are the only company in the United States or Canada that provides both CNG and LNG vehicle fuel on a significant scale.
Market for Natural Gas as a Vehicle Fuel
Natural Gas Vehicles for America (“NGV America”) estimates that, as of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 1,750 natural gas fueling stations in the United States and 175,000 natural gas vehicles on American roads.
We believe the following benefits of natural gas fuel may encourage the development of the market for RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel in the United States:
Domestic and Plentiful Supply.    Technological advances in natural gas drilling and production, including the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling techniques and the use of hydraulic fracturing, have unlocked vast natural gas reserves. The United States has proven, abundant and growing reserves of natural gas, and produces the highest volume of natural gas in the world.
Less Expensive.    Due to the abundance of natural gas, the cost of natural gas in the United States is less than the cost of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. Based on projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, we believe natural gas will remain cheaper than gasoline and diesel for the foreseeable future. In addition, because the price of the natural gas commodity makes up a smaller portion of the cost of a GGE of CNG or LNG relative to the commodity portion of the cost of a GGE of diesel or gasoline, the price of a GGE of CNG or LNG is less sensitive to increases in the underlying commodity cost.
Cleaner.    Natural gas contains less carbon than any other fossil fuel and, as a result, produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions when burned.  The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) has concluded that a vehicle fueled by natural gas has fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable vehicle fueled by gasoline or diesel, on a well-to-wheel basis. Additionally, a study from Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, indicates that natural gas vehicles produce between 13% and 21% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline- and diesel -fueled vehicles.
We believe RNG vehicle fuel has enhanced environmental benefits relative to gasoline and diesel vehicle fuels. For natural gas vehicles that run on RNG we estimate, based on CARB data, that the greenhouse gas emissions produced are at least 70% less than comparable gasoline- and diesel -fueled vehicles, depending on the source of the RNG. We believe the RNG we sell for use 
4

as a vehicle fuel, which is distributed under the brand name Redeem, is the first commercially available RNG vehicle fuel made from organic waste.
Further, natural gas engines now commercially available for heavy-duty, regional-haul, refuse, transit and vocational applications have been certified to the CARB and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) optional low NOx emission standard of 0.02 g/bhp-hr. This means that these engines emit 90% less smog-forming nitrogen oxides (also known as “NOx”) than the existing regulatory standards, making them the lowest certified ultra-low NOx emission engines in North America. We therefore believe vehicles equipped with ultra-low NOx engines that are fueled with RNG are the cleanest commercially available vehicles in North America (in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and NOx). 
We believe the relative environmental benefits of natural gas as a vehicle fuel could become increasingly important if, as we expect, air quality regulations become increasingly stringent, new regulations mandating low carbon fuels are enacted and fleet operators expand their initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel diversity.
Safer.    As reported by NGV America, CNG and LNG are relatively safer than gasoline and diesel because they dissipate into the air when spilled or in the event of a vehicle accident. When released, CNG and LNG are also less combustible than gasoline or diesel because they ignite only at relatively high temperatures. The fuel tanks and systems used in natural gas vehicles are subjected to a number of federally required safety tests, such as fire, environmental hazard, burst pressure and crash testing, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. CNG and LNG are stored in above-ground tanks and therefore will not contaminate soil or groundwater in the event of a spill or leak. 
Natural Gas Vehicles
Natural gas vehicles use internal combustion engines similar to those used in gasoline- or diesel -powered vehicles, and the acceleration and other performance characteristics of natural gas vehicles are also similar to those of gasoline- or diesel -powered vehicles of the same weight and engine class. Natural gas vehicles, whether they run on CNG or LNG, are refueled using a hose and nozzle that makes an airtight seal with the vehicle’s fuel tank.
Natural gas vehicles have engines specially tuned to run on natural gas fuels, which have higher octane content than gasoline or diesel, and fuel tanks and lines specially designed to hold CNG and LNG and deliver it to the vehicle’s engine. These special features, including principally the fuel tanks that hold CNG and LNG, cause natural gas vehicles to typically cost more than comparable gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles. Additionally, for heavy-duty vehicles, spark -ignited natural gas vehicles generally operate more quietly than comparable diesel-powered vehicles. Due to improvements in diesel engine technology, natural gas vehicles may be somewhat less efficient than diesel vehicles in terms of miles per gallon, depending upon the application. 
Virtually any car, truck, bus or other vehicle is capable of being manufactured or modified to run on natural gas. Many types and models of heavy-, medium- and light- duty natural gas vehicles and engines are available in the United States and Canada, including, among others, long-haul tractors, refuse trucks, regional tractors, transit buses, ready-mix trucks, delivery trucks, vocational work trucks, school buses, shuttles, passenger sedans, pickup trucks and cargo and passenger vans. We expect additional types and models of natural gas vehicles to become available if adoption of RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel becomes more widespread in the United States.
Our Products, Services and Other Business Activities
Our principal products, services and other business activities are described below. Information about the revenue we receive from these activities is discussed in this report in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
CNG Sales.    CNG is natural gas that is compressed and dispensed in gaseous form. CNG is typically delivered by obtaining natural gas from local utilities or third-party marketers and then compressing and storing it at a fueling station and dispensing it directly into a vehicle. Some of the natural gas we obtain from third parties for CNG sales is purchased under take-or-pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of natural gas.
We sell CNG for use as a vehicle fuel through fueling stations located on our customers’ properties and through our network of public access fueling stations. Our CNG vehicle fuel sales are made primarily through contracts with our customers. Under many of these contracts, pricing is determined on an index-plus basis, which is calculated by adding a margin and delivery cost to the local index or utility price for natural gas. As a result, CNG vehicle fuel sales determined by an index-plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas, including transportation charges, utility costs and other fees. The remainder of our CNG vehicle fuel sales are made on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access fueling stations based on prevailing market conditions.
Through our subsidiary NG Advantage, LLC (“NG Advantage”), we also transport and sell CNG for non-vehicle purposes via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects. NG Advantage transports CNG to industrial and institutional energy users that 
5

do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines. NG Advantage also transports CNG between pipelines for customers that desire to take advantage of commodity price differences. NG Advantage uses a fleet of 103 high-capacity tube trailers to transport CNG and we anticipate that NG Advantage will need to purchase or lease additional trailers and equipment in the future in support of its operations and customer contracts.
LNG Production and Sales.    LNG is natural gas that is cooled at a liquefaction facility to approximately -260 degrees Fahrenheit until it condenses into a liquid. We obtain LNG from our own liquefaction plants and from third -party suppliers. We own and operate LNG liquefaction plants near Boron, California and Houston, Texas, which we call the “Boron Plant” and the “Pickens Plant” respectively. The Boron Plant can produce 60.0 million gallons of LNG per year and has a dual tanker trailer loading system and a 1.8 million gallon storage tank that can hold up to 1.5 million usable gallons. The Pickens Plant can produce 35.0 million gallons of LNG per year and includes a tanker trailer loading system and a 1.0 million gallon storage tank that can hold up to 840,000 usable gallons. In 2018, we purchased 24.8% of our LNG from third-party suppliers and we produced the remainder of our LNG at our plants.
We sell LNG for use as a vehicle fuel on a bulk basis to fleet customers, who often own and operate their fueling stations, and through our network of public access fueling stations. We deliver LNG via our fleet of 75 tanker trailers to fueling stations, where it is stored and then dispensed in liquid form into vehicles. We contract with third parties to provide tractors and drivers. The need to liquefy and transport LNG generally causes LNG to cost more than CNG. We sell LNG through supply contracts that are priced on an index-plus basis, such that LNG sales under these contracts increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas. We also sell LNG vehicle fuel on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access fueling stations based on prevailing market conditions. Additionally, we sell LNG for non-vehicle purposes, including to customers who use LNG in oil fields, and for utility, industrial, marine and rail applications.
RNG Sales.    RNG can be delivered as CNG or LNG. It is produced from organic waste at landfills, animal waste digesters, wastewater treatment plants and other locations. RNG production plants are connected to natural gas pipelines, which allow RNG to be transported to vehicle fueling stations where it can be compressed and dispensed as CNG, and to LNG liquefaction facilities where it is converted to LNG. We purchase RNG from third -party producers, and we sell that RNG for vehicle fuel use through our fueling infrastructure under the brand name Redeem.
O&M Services.   We perform O&M services for CNG and LNG fueling stations that we do not own. For these services, we generally charge a fixed or a per-gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station. We have an operations team that performs preventive maintenance and is available to respond to service requests.
Station Construction and Engineering.    We design and construct fueling stations and facility modifications and sell or lease some of these stations to our customers. We charge construction or other fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project. Since 2008, we have served as the general contractor or supervised qualified third-party contractors to build 450 natural gas fueling stations. We use a combination of custom designed and off-the-shelf equipment to build fueling stations. Equipment for a CNG station typically consists of dryers, compressors, dispensers and storage tanks; equipment for a LNG station typically consists of storage tanks and dispensing equipment. Many of our fueling stations have separate public access areas for retail customers, which generally have the look, feel and dispensing rates of gasoline and diesel fueling stations. We also offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets. For example, our NGV Easy Bay product is a natural gas vapor leak barrier developed specifically for natural gas vehicle facilities.
Sales of RINs and LCFS Credits.   We generate RIN Credits when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States, and we generate LCFS Credits when we sell RNG and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon. We can sell these credits to third parties who need the RINs and LCFS Credits to comply with federal and state emissions compliance requirements. Generally, the amount of RINs and LCFS Credits we generate increases as we sell higher volumes of natural gas as a vehicle fuel; however, the amount of credits we sell and our revenue from these sales can vary depending on a number of factors, including the market for these credits, which has been volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in recent periods, any changes to the federal and state programs under which the credits are generated and sold, and our ability to strictly comply with these programs.
Vehicle Acquisition and Finance.    We offer vehicle finance services, including loans and leases, to help our customers acquire natural gas vehicles. As appropriate, we apply for and receive federal, state and local incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers. We may also secure vehicles to place with customers and/or pay deposits with respect to these vehicles before receiving a firm order from our customers, which we may be required to purchase if our customers fail to purchase the vehicle as anticipated.
6

Grant Programs.    We apply for and help our fleet customers apply for federal, state and local grant programs in areas in which we operate. These programs can provide funding for natural gas vehicle conversions and purchases, natural gas fueling station construction and natural gas vehicle fuel sales.
Former Activities.    Before March 31, 2017, we produced at our own production plants a portion of the RNG that we sold. On March 31, 2017 we completed the BP Transaction, in which we sold to BP certain assets related to this RNG production business, including two RNG production facilities, a 50% ownership interest in joint ventures formed to develop two new RNG production facilities, and third-party RNG supply contracts. 
Before December 29, 2017, we, through our former subsidiary IMW Industries Ltd. (formerly known as Clean Energy Compression Corp.) (“CEC”), manufactured natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations. On December 29, 2017 we completed the CEC Combination, in which we combined CEC with SAFE S.p.A, the natural gas fueling compressor subsidiary of LR, in a new company known as “SAFE&CEC S.r.l.” SAFE&CEC S.r.l. is focused on manufacturing, selling and servicing natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market. We and LR own 49% and 51%, respectively, of SAFE&CEC S.r.l.
Customer Markets 
We serve customers in a variety of markets, including trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users and government fleets. We believe these customer markets are well-suited for the adoption of natural gas vehicle fuel because they consume relatively high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are facing increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental requirements.
Trucking. We believe heavy-duty trucking represents the greatest opportunity for natural gas to be used as a vehicle fuel in the United States, and as of December 31, 2018, we fuel over 3,000 heavy-duty trucks. Because these high-mileage vehicles consume substantial amounts of fuel, they can derive significant benefits from the lower cost of natural gas. We are focused on fueling more natural gas heavy-duty trucks, and many well-known shippers, manufacturers, retailers and other truck fleet operators have started to adopt natural gas fueled trucks to move their freight. Such companies include Honda, Frito-Lay, FedEx, Anheuser-Busch, Verizon, Bimbo, The Home Depot, AT&T, Colgate-Palmolive, Costco Wholesale, Lowes, Pepsi, UPS, MillerCoors, HP, Unilever, Starbucks, Kraft, Kroger, P&G, Hertz and Owens Corning. 
Zero Now.  To help facilitate the transition of trucking fleets to natural gas, we have launched the Zero Now truck financing program, which is intended to increase the deployment of the commercially available ultra-low NOx natural gas heavy-duty trucks in the United States and encourage these operators to fuel their trucks at our stations. The Zero Now program generally involves the following:

• | One or more truck leasing or finance companies will lease or sell ultra-low NOx natural gas heavy-duty trucks to vehicle fleets pursuant to lease or sale agreements with the fleet operators and with us, providing for periodic payments by the fleet operators of amounts equal to the payments that will be made for the lease or purchase of an equivalent truck that operates on diesel fuel, and providing for payment by us of the incremental cost of the natural gas truck over and above the diesel-equivalent truck; and


• | The fleet operators participating in the program will enter into fueling agreements with us, under which the operators will agree to purchase from us, and we will agree to supply, minimum monthly volumes of natural gas fuel at fixed prices (lower than diesel prices) in order to operate the trucks leased or purchased in the program and allow us to recoup our payment of the incremental cost of the natural gas trucks.

In order to implement the Zero Now program, we have entered into the following agreements: 

• | In January 2019, we entered into a term credit agreement with Société Générale (“SG”), as lender, under which we are permitted to draw, from time to time, through the beginning of January 2022, up to an aggregate of $100.0 million in order to satisfy our payment obligations for the incremental cost of natural gas trucks under the truck lease or sale agreements described above;


• | In January 2019, we entered into a credit support agreement with Total Holdings USA Inc. (“THUSA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of TOTAL S.A. (“TOTAL”), (which indirectly through another of its subsidiaries, holds approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock), pursuant to which THUSA has guaranteed our obligations under the term credit agreement with SG. In consideration for such guaranty, we have agreed to pay to THUSA a quarterly fee at a rate per annum equal to 10% of the average amount owed by us under the term credit agreement during the preceding quarter; and


• | In October 2018, we entered into commodity swap arrangements with Total Gas & Power North America, an affiliate of TOTAL and THUSA, with the intention to manage diesel price fluctuation risks related to the natural gas fuel

7

supply commitments we expect to make in our anticipated fueling agreements with fleet operators that participate in the Zero Now program. The swap arrangements cover five million diesel gallons of natural gas fuel volume annually from April 2019 through June 2024.
For more information about the Zero Now program and the related agreements, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and the disclosure in Item 9B of this report.
In addition, we are supporting the growth of the natural gas heavy-duty truck market through our negotiation of favorable CNG and LNG tank pricing from manufacturers, which we are passing along to our customers, and our network of natural gas truck-friendly fueling stations (we refer to this network as “America’s Natural Gas Highway” or “ANGH”), which we have built in key locations nationwide. Many existing ANGH stations are located at Pilot Flying J Travel Centers, one of the largest truck fueling operators in the United States.
Airports. We estimate that vehicles serving airports in the United States, including airport delivery fleets, rental car and parking passenger shuttles and taxis, consume an aggregate of approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. Additionally, many U.S. airports face emissions challenges and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce pollution, particularly as part of any expansion plans. As a result, many of these airports have adopted various strategies to address tailpipe emissions, including rental car and hotel shuttle consolidation and requiring or encouraging service vehicle operators to switch their fleets to natural gas. To assist in this effort, airports are contracting with service providers to design, build and operate natural gas fueling stations in strategic locations on their properties.
As of December 31, 2018, we serve customers at 39 airports, including Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International, Baltimore Washington International, Dallas-Ft. Worth International, Denver International, Dulles International (Washington D.C.), George Bush International (Houston), Las Vegas, Logan International (Boston), LaGuardia (New York City), John F. Kennedy International (New York City), Los Angeles International, Newark International, Oakland International, Orlando, Phoenix Sky Harbor International, San Francisco International, San Diego International, SeaTac International (Seattle) and Tampa International.
Refuse. According to INFORM, there are nearly 200,000 refuse trucks in the United States that collect and haul refuse and recyclables, which collectively consume approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. We estimate that approximately 55% of new refuse trucks in 2018 operate on natural gas, up from approximately 3% of new refuse trucks in 2008. Refuse haulers are increasingly adopting trucks that run on CNG to realize operational savings and to address their customers' demands for reduced emissions. 
As of December 31, 2018, we fuel over 12,000 refuse vehicles for customers including Waste Management and Republic Services, as well as other waste haulers such as Atlas Disposal, Burrtec, Recology, South San Francisco Scavenger, Waste Connections and Waste Pro, among others. We also provide vehicle fueling services to municipal refuse fleets, including fleets in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio and New York City, among other locations. 
Public Transit. According to the American Public Transportation Association, there are over 71,000 municipal transit buses operating in the United States. In many areas, increasingly stringent emissions standards have limited the fueling options available to public transit operators. Also, transit agencies typically fuel at a central location and use high volumes of fuel. We estimate that transit agencies in the United States consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. Many transit agencies have been early adopters of natural gas vehicles, and over 25% of existing transit buses and over 35% of new transit buses operate on natural gas. 
As of December 31, 2018, we fuel close to 9,000 transit vehicles for customers including Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, Foothill Transit (Los Angeles County, California), Orange County Transit Authority, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, Dallas Area Rapid Transit Phoenix Transit, New Jersey Transit, Jacksonville Transportation Authority, NICE Bus (Nassau County, New York) and Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, as well as public transit customers in British Columbia.
Industrial and Institutional Customers. NG Advantage uses its virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects to serve a number of customers that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines or desire to take advantage of commodity price differences. We also transport LNG to customers via virtual natural gas pipelines.
Government Fleets. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, contracts with government entities, such as municipal transit fleets, accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 22% of our revenue, respectively. 
Our representative government fleet customers include the California Department of Transportation, State of New York, State of Colorado, City of New York, City of Denver, City and County of Los Angeles, City of Newport Beach, South Coast Air Quality Management District (Southern California region), City and County of San Francisco, City of Oakland, City and County of Dallas, City of Phoenix, The University of California, and Oklahoma State University.

Competition
The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. We believe the biggest competition for CNG and LNG use as a vehicle fuel is gasoline and diesel because the vast majority of vehicles in our key markets are powered by these fuels. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, as well as producers and fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and fueling stations for other vehicle fuels. 
A number of established businesses are in the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuel, including alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers, utilities and their affiliates and other organizations. If the alternative vehicle fuel market grows in the future, then the number and type of participants in this market and their level of capital and other commitments to alternative vehicle fuel programs could increase. We believe there are approximately 20 competitors in the market for natural gas vehicle fuels in the U.S. and Canada, including:

• | Providers of CNG fuel infrastructure and fueling services, including Love’s Trillium, Gain Clean Fuels, TruStar Energy, AmpCNG and EVO CNG;


• | Fuel station owners, such as Kwik Trip, a company that owns CNG fueling stations in the Midwestern United States;


• | Applied LNG Technology, Stabilis and Prometheus Energy, each of which distributes LNG; and


• | Utilities and their affiliates in several states, including California, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Washington, which own and operate public access CNG stations that compete with our stations.

We also face high levels of competition with respect to our other business activities. For instance, we compete with many third parties for the rights to procure RNG from producers and for customers to purchase the RNG that we sell. In addition, we transport and sell CNG through NG Advantage’s virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects and compete with other participants in this market, including Xpress Natural Gas, OsComp Systems and Irving Ltd.
We compete for vehicle fuel users based on demand for the type of fuel, which may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, cost, supply, availability, quality, cleanliness and safety of the fuel; cost, availability and reputation of vehicles and engines; convenience and accessibility of fueling stations; and recognition of the brand. We believe we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors; however, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products; adopt more aggressive pricing policies, dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities; implement more robust or creative initiatives to advance consumer acceptance of their products; or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the vehicle fuels market. 
We expect competition to increase in the vehicle fuels markets generally. In addition, if the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, then we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel would also increase.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, the government procurement process, any political activities or lobbying in which we may engage, public reporting and taxation, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations, adoption of new regulations or failure by us to comply with applicable regulations may result in significant additional expense to us or our customers or a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations that significantly affect our various operating activities are described below. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date, but new regulations or amendments to existing regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business, and these unknown costs and effects are not specifically contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates.
Construction and Operation of CNG and LNG Stations. To construct a CNG or LNG fueling station, we must satisfy permitting and other requirements and either we or a third -party contractor must be licensed as a general engineering contractor. Each CNG and LNG fueling station must be constructed in accordance with federal, state and local regulations pertaining to station design, environmental health, accidental release prevention, above-ground storage tanks and hazardous waste and other materials. For fueling stations we operate, we are also required to register with certain state agencies as a retailer/wholesaler of CNG and 
9

LNG. We also may benefit from any grant programs or similar government incentives that may be available for the construction of natural gas fueling stations.
Transfer of LNG. Federal safety standards require each transfer of LNG to be conducted in accordance with specific written safety procedures. These procedures must require that qualified personnel be in attendance during all LNG transfer operations, and these procedures must be implemented, and copies of the procedures must be available or displayed, at each LNG transfer location. 
Construction and Operation of LNG Liquefaction Plants. To build and operate LNG liquefaction plants, we must apply for facility permits or licenses that address many aspects of plant operations, including storm water and wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions related to production activities and equipment operation. The construction of LNG plants must also be approved by local planning boards and fire departments.
Vehicle Finance. State agencies generally require the registration of finance lenders. For example, in California, pursuant to the California Finance Lenders Law, one of our subsidiaries is required to be registered as a finance lender with the California Department of Corporations.
Generation and Sale of RIN Credits and LCFS Credits. In February 2010, the EPA finalized the RFS (which was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992/2005), which creates RINs that can be generated by the production and use of RNG in the transportation sector and sold to fuel providers that are not compliant under the RFS. In addition, CARB and comparable agencies in Oregon have adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which encourages low carbon “compliant” transportation fuels (including CNG, LNG and RNG) in the California and Oregon marketplace by allowing producers of these fuels to generate LCFS Credits that can be sold to noncompliant regulated parties.
Sale of Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel: AFTC. Under separate pieces of U.S. federal legislation, we have been eligible to receive the AFTC, an alternative fuels tax credit, for our natural gas vehicle fuel sales made between October 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017. The AFTC credit was equal to $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG that we sold as vehicle fuel, $0.50 per liquid gallon of LNG that we sold as vehicle fuel through 2015, and $0.50 per diesel gallon equivalent of LNG that we sold as vehicle fuel in 2016 and 2017. Based on the service relationship with our customers, either we or our customers claim the credit. On February 9, 2018, AFTC was retroactively extended from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, and AFTC revenue for the 2017 calendar year was recognized and collected in 2018. AFTC is not available, and may not be reinstated, for vehicle fuel sales after December 31, 2017. 
Sale of Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel, Operation of Fueling Stations and Production of LNG: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation. California has enacted laws and regulations that require specified greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and the federal government and several other state governments are considering similar measures. These regulations, if and when adopted and implemented, could affect several areas of our operations, including our sales of conventional and renewable natural gas and the operation of our CNG and LNG fueling stations and our LNG production plants.
California’s emissions laws require statewide reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. As of January 1, 2015, California’s AB 32 law began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, including the emissions associated with the CNG and LNG vehicle fuel we sell in the state.
Under AB 32, the regulated party with respect to CNG vehicle fuel use is the utility that owns the pipe through which the fossil fuel natural gas is sold.  We anticipate that, over time, as the utilities’ costs increase to comply with this law, we or, to the extent we pass these costs through to our customers, our CNG customers will be required to pay more for CNG vehicle fuel to cover the increased AB 32 compliance costs of the utility. The amount of these costs that we or our CNG customers will be required to pay will be determined by the amount a utility spends to buy any carbon credits needed to comply with AB 32 and the amount of natural gas we or our customers buy through the utility’s pipeline. With respect to LNG vehicle fuel use, the LNG vehicle fuel provider is the regulated party under AB 32. As a result, we will incur increased costs to comply with AB 32, and the amount of the increase will be based on how much LNG vehicle fuel we sell that is regulated, CARB’s requirements relating to the regulation of LNG vehicle fuel, any applicable regulatory changes and the cost of any carbon credits we purchase to comply with AB 32. We expect to try to pass the costs we incur to comply with this law through to our LNG customers. To the extent we are not able to pass the increased costs of CNG and LNG vehicle fuel as a result of AB 32 through to our customers, we could experience increased direct expenses and reduced margins.

We market our brands, products and services primarily through our direct sales force, which includes sales representatives covering all of our major geographic and customer markets, as well as attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events. Our sales and marketing team also works closely with federal, state and local government agencies to

provide education about the value of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and to keep abreast of proposed and newly adopted regulations that affect our industry.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 401 people. We have not experienced any work stoppages and none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.
Seasonality
To some extent, our business may experience seasonality. For more information, see the discussion under “Seasonality and Inflation” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights primarily consist of trade secrets, know-how and trademarks, and we rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secret laws, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect these rights and our proprietary information. These intellectual property rights help us to retain existing business and secure new relationships with customers. 
Corporate Information
