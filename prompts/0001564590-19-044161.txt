Item 1. Business 
Business Overview
 Geospace Technologies Corporation reincorporated as a Texas corporation on April 16, 2015.  We originally incorporated as a Delaware corporation on September 27, 1994.  Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries.  We principally design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment.  These seismic products are marketed to the oil and gas industry and used to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs.  We also market our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications.  We design and manufacture other products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment and offshore cables.  We report and categorize our customers and products into three different segments:  Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets.
 Demand for our seismic products targeted at customers in our Oil and Gas Markets segment has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general.  For more information, please refer to the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 Business Acquisitions
 OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology
  On November 13, 2018, we acquired all of the intellectual property and related assets of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology business.  The operations of the OptoSeis® business are included in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment.  The acquisition purchase price consisted of cash payments at closing of approximately $1.8 million and contingent earn-out payments of up to $23.2 million during the five-and-a-half year period.  The contingent earn-out payments will be derived from eligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services utilizing the OptoSeis® fiber optic technology.  There were no earn-out obligation payments made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
 Quantum Technology Sciences, Inc.
  On July 27, 2018, we acquired Quantum Technology Sciences, Inc., a Florida-based tactical security and surveillance systems solutions provider (“Quantum”) through a merger of the Company’s subsidiary with and into Quantum, with Quantum as the surviving corporation.  The acquisition purchase price consisted of a cash down payment at closing of approximately $4.4 million and contingent earn-out payments of up to $23.5 million over a four-year period.  The contingent earn-out payments, if any, which may be paid in the form of cash or Company stock, will be derived from certain eligible revenue that may be generated during the four-year earn-out period.  There were no earn-out obligation payments made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
 The Quantum acquisition represents the Company’s strategy to expand its product revenues, as well as its engineering and manufacturing competencies, to markets outside the oil and gas industry.   The operations of Quantum are included in our Emerging Markets business segment.    
 Segment and Geographical Information
 Effective September 30, 2018, we began reporting and evaluating financial information for three business segments: Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets.  The Oil and Gas Markets segment was previously referred to as our Seismic segment.  Our Adjacent Markets segment was previously referred to as our Non-Seismic segment.  The Emerging Markets segment was added in conjunction with the acquisition of Quantum in July 2018, which designs and markets seismic products targeted at the border and perimeter security markets.  Because we have simply renamed our two original segments and added a new segment, we have not restated any previous financial statements.  For a discussion of the products sold and markets served by each of our segments, see “Products and Product Development” below.  For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Products and Product Development
 Oil and Gas Markets
 Our Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue.  Geoscientists use seismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them.  This segment’s products include wireless seismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as geophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic 
 2

products.  We believe that our Oil and Gas Markets products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for seismic data acquisition.
 Traditional Products
 An energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data.  We provide many of the components of seismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings, connectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products.  On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis.  In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes.  Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis.  Our marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.
 Our seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use.  Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as components of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already in use.
 Wireless Products
 We have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system.  Rather than utilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stations operate as an independent data collection system, allowing for virtually unlimited channel configurations.  As a result, our wireless systems require less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation.  Each wireless station is available in a single-channel or three-channel configuration.  Since its introduction in 2008 and through September 30, 2019, we have sold 441,000 wireless channels and we currently have 84,000 wireless channels in our rental fleet.  
 We have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX.  Similar to our land-based wireless systems, the marine OBX system may be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require interconnecting cables between each station.  Our deepwater versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters.  At September 30, 2019, we had 31,000 OBX stations in our rental fleet, and additional OBX stations under construction in order to meet contracted rental demand.  We expect fiscal year 2020 capital investments into our wireless product rental fleet to be $6 million based on the current level of demand.
 Reservoir Products
 Seismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within a producing oil and gas reservoir, and operators can use these surveys to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production.  This type of reservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes greater importance.  This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of time.  Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery.  Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution seismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management.  Utilizing these reservoir monitoring tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.
 We have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields.  Our electrical reservoir monitoring systems are currently installed on numerous offshore reservoirs in the North Sea and elsewhere.  Through our recent acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we now offer both electrical and fiber optic reservoir monitoring systems.  These high-definition seismic data acquisition systems have a flexible architecture allowing them to be configured as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects.  The scalable architecture of these systems enable custom designed configuration for applications ranging from low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”).  The modular architecture of these products allows virtually unlimited channel expansion for these systems.  
 In addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems that employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very high data transmission rates.  These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered by us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of hydraulic fracturing operations.

We believe our reservoir characterization products make seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for reservoir monitoring.  Our multi-component seismic product developments also include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays and cases.
 We have not received any orders for large-scale seabed PRM systems since November 2012 and we currently do not have any indication that such an order will be received in fiscal year 2020, although we do believe opportunities for PRM orders exist in today’s market.  
 Adjacent Markets
 Our Adjacent Markets businesses leverage upon existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities utilized by our Oil and Gas Markets businesses.  Many of the seismic products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, with little or no modification, have direct application to other industries.  
Industrial Products
 Our industrial products include water meter products, contract manufacturing products, offshore cables, and seismic sensors used for vibration monitoring and geotechnical applications such as mine safety applications and earthquake detection.
Imaging Products
 Our imaging products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging and digital inkjet printing technologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries.  
Emerging Markets
 Our Emerging Markets business segment consists of our recent acquisition of Quantum.  Quantum’s product line includes a proprietary detection system called SADAR®, which detects, locates and tracks items of interest in real-time.  Using the SADAR technology, Quantum designs and sells products used for border and perimeter security surveillance, cross-border tunneling detection and other products targeted at movement monitoring, intrusion detection and situational awareness.  Quantum’s customers include various agencies of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.
Business Strategy
 We have experienced several years of very low demand for most of the products we sell and rent into our Oil and Gas Markets.  We are now seeing some signs of increased oil and gas exploration activities brought about by improving market prices for crude oil.  Specifically, we are seeing significant rental demand for some of our oil and gas products used to gather seismic data on the ocean-bottom and we are allocating capital resources to the production of these products.  Conversely, depressed demand continues for our marine PRM systems and many of our land-focused seismic products.  As a result, we have adopted what we think is a conservative and prudent business strategy which places a focus on sound financial management practices.  We have not changed our primary focus on continued investment in product research and development, selective acquisitions and joint ventures.

• | Continue Investment in Product Research and Development – Past periods of revenue growth were primarily driven through our internal development of new products for the oil and gas industry. In past years, our oil and gas product innovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, land and seabed PRM systems and wireless data acquisition systems for both land and marine applications. These innovative technologies are the result of our unceasing investment in research and development initiatives. A majority of our product research and development cost relates to our product engineers. Our engineering staff has been key to our past success, and we intend to continue our tradition of retaining and attracting quality engineering staff by providing appropriate compensation and benefits. Going forward, we intend to continue significant investments in product research and development of new oil and gas technologies as well as products for our other business segments in order to diversify and grow our revenue base.

• | Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap – The oil and gas industry periodically experiences volatile business cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our business activities to meet the industry’s demand for our products. This industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us limited visibility into new orders creating challenges for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce, inventories and other working capital challenges. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our oil and gas seismic product offerings, as seen recently with our acquisition of the OptoSeis® fiber optic sensing technology, we may also seek out other business opportunities in adjacent markets and emerging markets which complement our existing oil and gas

seismic products, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and company-wide culture. In order to diversify our revenue base and expose us to different markets with different business cycles, we may direct these efforts toward businesses outside the oil and gas industry, as seen with our acquisition of Quantum in fiscal year 2018. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial Management – Industry conditions since fiscal year 2014 have required us to place increased emphasis on cash management and preservation. Due to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, we have historically managed our financial risk by limiting or eliminating debt leverage in our balance sheet. While we are not opposed to moderate amounts of short-term debt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to long-term debt obligations which, in our view, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business cycles in the oil and gas industry similar to the recent business environment. We believe this strategy has allowed us to continue operations through difficult business cycles without disruption for debt and equity restructuring as has been seen among our peers, many of whom have significant long-term debt burdens. In addition, we have limited our investments in capital assets and have liquidated, and made appropriate reserves for, significant amounts of our inventories and rental fleet assets. We also believe that the value of our common shares outstanding will be best served in the long-term by retaining our cash and short-term investments to fund future cash outflows as they become necessary. In this regard, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, nor do we expect to initiate any buy-back program to repurchase our common stock.

Competition
 Oil and Gas Products
 We are one of the world’s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic products used in the oil and gas industry.  The principal competitors for many of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG) and INOVA (a joint venture formed in 2009 between ION Geophysical and Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company).  Furthermore, entities in China affiliated with Sercel, as well as other Chinese manufacturers produce low-cost oil and gas seismic products.  
 The primary competitors for our land wireless data acquisition systems are Sercel, INOVA and numerous smaller entities who have introduced similar versions of wireless data acquisition systems.  We believe the primary competitors for our marine nodal data acquisition systems are Magseis Fairfield ASA and Seabed Geosolutions (a joint venture formed between Fugro and CGG), each of whom utilizes their own proprietary nodal technology.  
 Most oil and gas seismic products are price sensitive, so the ability to manufacture these products at a low cost is essential to maintain market share.  While price is an important factor in a customer’s decision to purchase a land or marine wireless data acquisition system, we believe customers also place a high value on a product’s historical performance and the ongoing engineering and field support provided by the product’s manufacturer.  
 The principal keys for success in the seismic instruments and equipment market are technological superiority, product durability under harsh field conditions, reliability and customer support.  Product deliverability is always an important consideration for our customers.  
 In general, most customers prefer to standardize data acquisition systems, geophones and hydrophones, particularly if they are used by seismic companies that have multiple crews which are able to support each other.  This standardization makes it difficult for competitive manufacturers to gain market share from other manufacturers with existing customer relationships.
 Our primary competitors for the rental of our traditional and wireless seismic equipment are Mitcham Industries, Inc. and Seismic Equipment Solutions.
 Our primary competitor for our seabed PRM systems is Alcatel-Lucent.  Our primary competitors for high-definition borehole seismic data acquisition systems are Avalon Sciences Ltd and Sercel.  
 Adjacent Markets Products
 Our industrial and imaging products face competition from numerous domestic and international specialty product manufacturers.
 Emerging Markets Products
 The border and perimeter security marketplace is dominated by large integrated system providers such as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Elbit Systems and others.  Systems provided by these competitors are generally multifaceted and may include numerous integrated surveillance technologies, including the geophysical sensor and software systems that we have developed.  Our sensing technology does not rely on line-of-sight motion detection, which is required by cameras and other optical 
 5

technologies enabling motion-sensing a camera would miss.  Competitive geophysical technologies utilizing fiber optic sensing techniques are provided by OptaSense, Fibersensys, Future Fiber Technologies and other specialty sensor manufacturing firms. 
 Suppliers
 We purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers located in various countries.  We typically have multiple suppliers for our critical materials.  In our oil and gas seismic business segment, certain models of our marine wireless products use a timing device manufactured by a single supplier.  We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable source for this device.  In our Adjacent Markets business segment, we purchase all of our imaging thermal film from a single supplier.  Beyond this film supplier, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment.  For a discussion of the risks related to our reliance on these suppliers, see “Risk Factors – We Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products.”
 We do not currently experience any significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials from our suppliers for the production of our products.
 Product Manufacturing and Assembly
 Our manufacturing and product assembly operations consist of machining, molding or cabling the necessary component parts, configuring these parts along with components received from various vendors and assembling a final product.  We manufacture many of our oil and gas seismic products to the specifications required by our customers.  For example, we can armor cables for use in multiple deep water applications.  We assemble geophone strings based on a number of customer choices such as length, gauge, tolerance and color of molded parts.  Upon completion of our manufacturing and assembly operations, we test our final products to the functional and environmental extremes of product specifications and inspect the products for quality assurance.  Consistent with industry practice, we normally manufacture our products based on firm customer orders, anticipated customer orders and historical product demand.  As a result of the steep decline in product demand that began in fiscal year 2014, aggravated by the decline in crude oil prices, we currently hold significant levels of inventories.
Markets and Customers
 Our principal customers for our traditional and wireless seismic products are seismic contractors and, to a lesser extent, major independent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify seismic instrument and equipment preferences to contractors.  For our deep water PRM products, our customers are generally large international oil and gas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties.  Our industrial product customers consist of specialty manufacturers, research institutions and industrial product distributors.   Our imaging customers primarily consist of direct users of our equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the screen-printing and flexographic printing industries.  Our border and perimeter security customers are primarily government agencies.   
 Three customers comprised 19.7%, 5.2% and 20.0% of our revenue during fiscal year 2019.  The latter two customers are affiliated with a common parent company.  One customer comprised 10.4% of our revenue during fiscal year 2018.  One customer comprised 17.8% of our revenue during fiscal year 2017.  The following table describes our revenue by customer segment type (in thousands):

Intellectual Property
 We seek to protect our intellectual property by means of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures.  We hold patents on geophones, micro-geophones, piezo-electric sensors, seismic data acquisition, in-line retrieval devices and water meter connectors, and we have pending applications on related technology.  We do not consider any single patent essential to our success.  Our patents are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2037.  We are not able to predict the effect of any patent expiration.  We protect our proprietary rights to our technology through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Research and Development
 We expect to incur significant future research and development expenditures aimed at the development of additional products for each of our business segments.  We have incurred company-sponsored research and development expenses of $15.5 million, $10.8 million and $13.8 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Employees
 As of September 30, 2019, we employed 786 people predominantly on a full-time basis, of which 513 were employed in the United States, 242 in the Russian Federation and the remainder in the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Colombia.  A majority of our employees in the Russian Federation belong to a regional union for machine manufacturers.  Our remaining employees are not unionized.  We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
