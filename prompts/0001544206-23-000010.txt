Item 1. Business
Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Investment Company Act”). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Code”). We were formed in February 2012, commenced investment operations in May 2013 and began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the symbol “CGBD,” upon completion of our initial public offering in June 2017. Our principal executive offices are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017. 
Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through assembling a portfolio of secured debt investments in U.S. middle market companies. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately $25 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), supported by financial sponsors. This core strategy is opportunistically supplemented with differentiated and complementary lending and investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and “unitranche” loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, “Middle Market Senior Loans”), with a minority of our assets invested in higher yielding investments (which may include unsecured debt, subordinated debt and investments in equities).
We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt has been rated below investment grade, or would likely be rated below investment grade if such debt was rated. These securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have 
predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Investments— Our investments are risky and speculative.”
Our investment approach is focused on capital preservation based on long-term fundamental credit performance. Our Investment Adviser’s investment team utilizes a rigorous, systematic, and consistent investment process, refined over Carlyle’s 35-year history investing in private markets across multiple cycles, designed to achieve enhanced risk-adjusted returns. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
Our Investment Adviser
CGCIM, our Investment Adviser, manages our investment activities, including sourcing potential investments, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments on an ongoing basis.
Our Investment Adviser is part of Carlyle’s Global Credit segment, and benefits from the more than 230 experienced investment professionals across the origination, capital markets, underwriting and portfolio management teams. Our Investment Adviser’s investment committee that oversees our investment activities comprises several of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across multiple asset classes with significant industry experience and tenure. The investment committee is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The members of the investment committee have experience investing through different credit cycles. The investment committee is led by Mark Jenkins, a Managing Director and Head of Global Credit at Carlyle.
Our Investment Adviser also serves, and may in the future serve, as investment adviser to other existing and future affiliated BDCs that have investment objectives similar to our investment objectives.
On April 3, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not “interested persons” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (the “Independent Directors”), approved an investment advisory agreement (the “Original Investment Advisory Agreement”) between the Company and the Investment Adviser in accordance with, and on the basis of an evaluation satisfactory to such directors as required by, Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act.
The Original Investment Advisory Agreement was amended on September 15, 2017 (as amended, the “First Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement”) after the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, at an in-person meeting of the Board of Directors held on May 30, 2017 and the approval of the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held on September 15, 2017 and August 6, 2018 (as amended, the “Investment Advisory Agreement”). Unless terminated earlier, the Investment Advisory Agreement renews automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board of Directors and by the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors. On May 9, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved at an in-person meeting the continuance of the Company’s Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser for an additional one year term. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days’ written notice to the other party. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of two components—a base management fee and an incentive fee. 
Our base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the average value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters; provided, however, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of the Company’s gross assets as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters that exceeds the product of (A) 200% and (B) the average value of the Company’s net asset value at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. “Gross assets” is determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, includes assets acquired through the incurrence of debt (see Note 7, Borrowings, and Note 8, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), and excludes cash and any temporary investments in cash-equivalents. For purposes of this calculation, cash and cash equivalent includes U.S. government securities and other high-quality investment grade debt investments that mature in 12 months or less from the date of investment. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, will be appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during such the applicable fiscal quarters, and will be appropriately pro-rated for any partial month or quarter. 
The incentive fee has two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The second part is determined and payable in arrears based on capital gains as of the end of each calendar year. 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a “hurdle rate” of 1.50% per quarter (6% annualized) or a “catch-up rate” of 1.82% per quarter (7.28% annualized), as applicable.
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays its Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to its pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:

•no incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which its pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.50%;
•100% of pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.82% in any calendar quarter (7.28% annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.82%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately 17.5% of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.82% in any calendar quarter; and
•17.5% of the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.82% in any calendar quarter (7.28% annualized) will be payable to the Investment Adviser. This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Adviser.
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 17.5% of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the date of determination, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that, the incentive fee determined at the end of the first calendar year of operations may be calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation.
Our Administrator
On April 3, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) between the Company and CGCA, a Delaware limited liability company, (the “Administrator”). Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides services and receives reimbursements equal to an amount that reimburses the Administrator for its costs and expenses and the Company’s allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the Company’s allocable portion of the compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by the Company’s officers (including the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and respective staff who provide services to the Company, operations staff who provide services to the Company, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in the Company’s Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control assessment. Reimbursement under the Administration Agreement occurs quarterly in arrears.
Unless terminated earlier, the Administration Agreement renews automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the vote of the Board of Directors or by a majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company’s Independent Directors. On 
May 9, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the Administration Agreement for a one year period. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other party and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
On April 3, 2013, the Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement with Carlyle Employee Co. (the “Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement”). Pursuant to the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement, Carlyle Employee Co. provides the Administrator ), provides our Administrator with access to Carlyle’s finance, operations, legal, compliance and administrative professionals..
On April 3, 2013, the Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”), which was amended on March 11, 2015 (as amended, the “State Street Sub-Administration Agreement” and, together with the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement, the “Sub-Administration Agreements”). Pursuant to the State Street Sub-Administration Agreement, State Street provides certain administrative and professional services. State Street also serves as our custodian Unless terminated earlier, the State Street Sub-Administration Agreement renews automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the vote of the Board of Directors or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company’s Independent Directors. On May 9, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the State Street Sub-Administration Agreement for a one year period. The State Street Sub-Administration Agreement may be terminated upon at least 60 days’ written notice and without penalty by the vote of a majority of the outstanding securities of the Company, or by the vote of the Board of Directors or by either party to the State Street Sub-Administration Agreement.
Carlyle
Our Investment Adviser and Administrator are affiliates of Carlyle. Carlyle is a global investment firm with deep industry expertise that deploys private capital across three business segments: Global Private Equity, Global Credit and Global Investment Solutions. With $373 billion of assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 31, 2022, Carlyle’s teams invest across a range of strategies that leverage its deep industry expertise, local insights, and global resources to deliver attractive returns throughout an investment cycle. Carlyle employs nearly 2,100 employees, including more than 770 investment professionals in 29 offices across five continents, and serves more than 2,900 active carry fund investors from 88 countries.
Carlyle’s Global Credit segment, which had $146.3 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2022, advises products that pursue investment strategies across the credit spectrum, including: liquid credit, illiquid credit, and real assets credit, as well as platform initiatives such as Carlyle Tactical Private Credit Fund (“CTAC,” or the “Interval Fund”). Global Credit, which also includes Carlyle’s Insurance Solutions and Global Capital Markets businesses, has been Carlyle’s fastest-growing segment in the past four years, with total AUM nearly doubling in 2022 alone. Since the establishment of Global Credit in 1999, these various capital sources provide the opportunity for Carlyle to offer highly customizable and creative financing solutions to borrowers to meet their specific capital needs. Carlyle draws on the expertise and underwriting capabilities of 233 investment professionals dedicated to the Global Credit segment and leverages the resources and industry expertise of Carlyle’s global network to provide creative solutions for borrowers. 
Primary areas of focus for Carlyle’s Global Credit segment include:
Liquid Credit
•Loans and Structured Credit. The structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and other investment vehicles. In 2022, in addition to the acquisition of the management contracts for the CBAM CLO portfolio, Carlyle closed six new U.S. CLOs and three CLOs in Europe with an aggregate size of $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, Carlyle’s loans and structured credit team advised structured credit funds totaling approximately $50.4 billion in AUM.
Illiquid Credit
•Direct Lending. Carlyle’s direct lending business includes Carlyle’s BDCs that invest primarily in middle market first-lien loans (which include unitranche, “first out” and “last out” loans) and second-lien loans of middle-market companies, typically defined as companies with annual EBITDA ranging from $25 million to $100 million, that lack access to the broadly syndicated loan and bond markets. As of December 31, 2022, Carlyle’s direct lending investment team advised AUM totaling approximately $9.4 billion.
•Opportunistic Credit. Carlyle’s opportunistic credit team invests primarily in highly-structured and privately-negotiated capital solutions supporting corporate borrowers through secured loans, senior subordinated debt, mezzanine debt, convertible notes, and other debt-like instruments, as well as preferred and common equity. The team will also look to invest in real estate and special situations (i.e., event-driven opportunities that exhibit hybrid credit and equity features) as well as market dislocations (i.e., primary and secondary market investments in liquid debt instruments that arise as a result of temporary market volatility). In certain investments, our funds may seek to restructure pre-reorganization debt claims into controlling positions in the equtiy of the reorganized companies. As of December 31, 2022, Carlyle’s opportunistic credit team advised products totaling approximately $12.8 billion in AUM. 
Real Assets Credit
•Aircraft Finance. Carlyle Aviation Partners is Carlyle's multi-strategy investment platform that is engaged in commercial aviation aircraft financing and investment throughout commercial aviation industry. As of December 31, 2022, Carlyle Aviation Partners had approximately $11.5 billion in AUM across active carry funds, securitization vehicles, liquid strategies, and other vehicles.
•Infrastructure Debt. Carlyle’s Infrastructure debt team invests primarily in directly originated and privately negotiated debt instruments related to global infrastructure projects, primarily in the power, energy, transportation, water/waste, telecommunications and social infrastructure sectors. The team focuses primarily on senior, subordinated, and mezzanine debt and seeks to invest primarily in developed markets within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). As of December 31, 2022, Carlyle’s infrastructure debt team managed approximately $3.7 billion in AUM.
Other Credit
•Platform Initiatives. Carlyle’s platform initiatives include CTAC, its closed-end interval fund which invests across Carlyle’s entire credit platform, as well as cross-platform separately managed accounts which are tailored to invest across Carlyle’s credit platform based on the specific needs of individual investors. These products also include structured solutions which focus on private, primarily investment-grade investments, backed by assets with contractual cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the Global Credit platform initiatives represented $6.1 billion in AUM.
•Insurance Solutions. Carlyle Insurance Solutions (“CIS”) combines Carlyle’s deep insurance expertise with portfolio construction capabilities, capital sourcing and asset origination strengths to provide comprehensive liability funding/reinsurance, asset management and advisory solutions for (re)insurance companies and fund investors. The CIS team oversees Carlyle’s investment in Fortitude Re, as well as the strategic advisory services agreement with certain subsidiaries of Fortitude Re. As of December 31, 2022, AUM related to capital raised from third-party investors to acquire a controlling interest in Fortitude Re was $5.7 billion. As of December 31, 2022, AUM related to the strategic advisory services agreement was $45.2 billion, including the net asset value of investments in Carlyle products, which is also reflected in the AUM and fee-earning AUM of the strategy in which they are invested. Fortitude Re and certain Fortitude Re reinsurance counterparties have committed approximately $9.2 billion of capital to-date to various Carlyle strategies.
•Global Capital Markets. Carlyle Global Capital Markets (“GCM”) is a loan syndication and capital markets business that launched in 2018. The primary focus of GCM is to arrange, place, underwrite, originate and syndicate loans and underwrite securities of third parties and Carlyle portfolio companies through TCG Capital Markets L.L.C. and TCG Senior Funding L.L.C.. TCG Capital Markets L.L.C. is a FINRA registered broker dealer. GCM may also act as the initial purchaser of such loans and securities. GCM receives fees, including underwriting, placement, structuring, transaction and syndication fees, commissions, underwriting and original issue discounts, interest payments and other compensation, which may be payable in cash or securities or loans, in respect of the activities described above and may elect to waive such fees.
Strategic Relationships
We have established, and may in the future establish, strategic relationships that may diversify our product offering, increase our scale, enhance our origination capabilities or provide other benefits. To this end, in February 2016, we and Credit Partners USA LLC (“Credit Partners”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PSP Investments Holding USA LLC, an affiliate of a large Canadian pension fund, agreed to co-invest through Credit Fund, a joint venture primarily focused on investing in first lien loans to middle market companies. Since its inception and through December 31, 2022, Credit Fund has invested in over $3.2 billion (before any repayments or exits) of senior secured loans. We and Credit Partners each have 50% economic 
ownership of Credit Fund and have commitments to fund, from time to time, capital of up to $250 million each. Additionally, in November 2020, we and Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund (“CCLF”), an investment vehicle managed by Cliffwater LLC, agreed to co-invest through Credit Fund II, a joint venture primarily focused on investing in senior secured loans of middle market companies. Since its inception and through December 31, 2022, Credit Fund II has invested in over $490.9 million (before any repayments or exits) of senior secured loans, including the initial portfolio of senior secured loans contributed by CSL. We and CCLF have 84.13% and 15.87% ownership in Credit Fund II, respectively. 
Board of Directors
The Company’s Board of Directors currently consists of seven members, four of whom are Independent Directors. The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and a Compensation Committee, and may establish additional committees in the future.
Competitive Strengths
Carlyle Global Credit’s key competitive strengths are based on Carlyle’s integrated platform – with a breadth of capabilities, scale of capital and depth of expertise – which Carlyle believes allows it to mitigate competition and thereby improve our ability to deliver on the expectations of shareholders. We believe the following characteristics distinguish Carlyle’s capabilities in private credit: 
•Proven Direct Origination Approach. Carlyle Direct Lending’s business directly originates nearly 100% of its investments, sourced from both the dedicated direct lending origination team as well as from the many adjacent capabilities across the Carlyle Global Credit platform. This origination approach has resulted in a strong and diversified flow of opportunities, approximately 1,500 per annum, from which Carlyle believes it can select investments with the best potential risk/reward characteristics.
•Breadth of Capabilities. Carlyle believes it has one of the broadest credit investment capabilities in the market today. As a global private credit platform, Carlyle has the ability to invest across the capital structure in first lien, unitranche, second lien, junior debt and preferred equity. Carlyle Global Credit can potentially serve as a one-stop shop, providing creative and holistic solutions for borrowers across the capital structure, which allows it to pursue investment opportunities with limited competition.
•Scale of Capital. With $146.3 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2022 across its platform, Carlyle Global Credit maintains a significant capital base that can provide a full capital solution, delivering certainty of execution for borrowers and mitigating opportunities for competitive disintermediation. 
•Depth of Expertise. Carlyle is a market leading global platform with $373 billion of AUM, an experienced and tenured bench of more than 770 investment professionals with well-established, long-standing relationships with sponsors, management teams, and industry experts, as of December 31, 2022. Carlyle believes that it brings differentiated diligence insights and extensive experience to inform credit selection. As a firm, Carlyle seeks to bring the collective power of the global platform with respect to individual investments, including sector credit analysts, Carlyle Private Equity’s deep knowledge and relationships with potential customers, suppliers or competitors of a given company, and internal dedicated diligence groups (e.g., government affairs and environment, social and corporate governance (“ESG”)). Carlyle believes this integrated and collaborative approach allows it to move faster and with higher conviction than its competitors in many scenarios. 
•Rigorous Credit Selection. Carlyle employs a robust, iterative and heavily documented underwriting process for its Direct Lending business, which consists of four “gates” where a credit is reviewed and requires sign-off, including (i) at the point of origination, (ii) by the underwriting team, (iii) by Carlyle Direct Lending’s screening committee (the “Direct Lending Screening Committee” or the “Screening Committee”) and finally (iv) by Carlyle’s illiquid credit investment committee at our Investment Adviser that oversees our investment activities (“Illiquid Credit Investment Committee” or “Investment Committee”). This rigorous diligence approach has allowed for a less than 3% closing rate on the approximately 1,500 transactions that were reviewed by the deal team over the past 12 months.
•Defensive Approach. Carlyle approaches the direct lending business with a defensive mindset that permeates all aspects of investment selection. On a strategic level, Carlyle seeks to construct well diversified portfolios, heavily weighted towards non-cyclical industries, and applies only moderate leverage at the portfolio level in order to seek to generate sustainable income levels. In addition, in individual asset selection, Carlyle favors sponsored over non-sponsored borrowers, seeks to transact with sponsors it knows well (approximately 80% of Carlyle Direct 
Lending’s business is with repeat sponsors), works with companies it knows well via its significant incumbencies, seeks opportunities at the top of the capital structure, and primarily invests in transactions where Carlyle maintains leadership or roles with significant influence (approximately 90% of originations having a titled role in recent years).
Market Opportunity
We believe the middle market lending environment provides attractive investment opportunities as a result of a combination of the following factors:
•Favorable Market Environment. We believe the middle market remains one of the most attractive investment areas due to its large size, superior value relative to the broadly syndicated loan market, and supply-demand imbalance that continues to favor non-bank lenders. We believe market yields remain attractive and leverage levels at middle market companies are stable, creating a favorable investment environment.
•Large and Growing U.S. Middle Market. The middle market direct lending asset class has undergone tremendous growth and maturation over the past decade and is one of the largest sub-segments of private credit, a now $1,400+ billion market. Carlyle believes this growth has been driven by fundamentally sound, secular drivers, including the expansion of private market activity, increased bank regulation and consolidation and structural changes in liquid credit markets, all of which create a significant opportunity for private credit investing.
•Benefits of Traditional Middle Market Focus. Carlyle believes that there are meaningful benefits to investing in middle market directly originated assets, which allows the strategy to generate excess return as compared to traditional fixed income asset classes, with comparable risk performance. The excess return is generated by prudently taking incremental complexity and illiquidity risk. Traditional middle market companies offer more attractive economics in the form of upfront fees, spreads and prepayment penalties. In addition, senior secured middle market loans typically have strong defensive characteristics and structural protections, including priority in the capital structure and covenants, with a majority of middle market loans structured with financial covenants relative to the broadly syndicated markets. Additional protection may be gained through better credit documentation and control, enhanced management and diligence access, monitoring of assets, and significantly more influence in the instance of a workout scenario. 
•Market Environment Favors Non-Traditional Lenders. The direct lending asset class has also benefited from an ongoing secular trend in the banking industry. Post Great Financial Crisis (“GFC”) in 2008, as tougher regulations have reshaped the landscape, traditional banks have reduced their lending capabilities by nearly 50% over the past ten years. As banks have retreated due to a number of new laws, regulations and regulatory guidance, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies’ leveraged lending guidelines and Basel III regulatory capital framework, institutional investors have increased their lending capabilities to fill the void. Post-GFC, institutional investors now originate over 80% of primary leveraged loan issuances in the U.S., generating an incremental capital opportunity for the asset class. 
•Favorable Capital Markets Trends. Over the past two decades, Carlyle has witnessed a secular trend with respect to the shift in economic activity from public to privately owned businesses due to less appetite for public market exposure. The number of public companies in the U.S. has dropped by over 50% from its peak, with a mirror image increase in the rise of private equity-backed companies. Overall public listing activity has declined by approximately two-thirds over the past forty years. These privately owned companies often prefer to finance themselves through the private markets, which has allowed for a natural expansion of the market opportunity for direct lenders on a secular basis for over a decade. Given current market dynamics, Carlyle believes that the asset class will continue to expand.
Investment Strategy
We primarily target loans to U.S.-based middle market companies that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, and refinancings, with a focus on companies controlled by private equity investment firms. In addition, we may also make investments in non-private equity owned public or private companies of various sizes; as well as invest in certain non-U.S.-based borrowers. We seek to partner with strong management teams executing long-term, value-maximizing strategies. Target investments typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics:
•Borrowers with EBITDA of $25–$100 million;
•Leading market positions;
•Defensible business strategies with significant barriers to entry;
•Diversified product offerings, customer bases and supplier profiles;
•Experienced management teams with successful track records;
•Significant valuation cushion, typically expressed as a significant equity investment from a financial sponsor;
•Demonstrated stability and/or growth of revenue;
•Predictable cash flows with limited risks of disruption; 
•Low capital expenditures requirements; and
•A North American base of operations.
While we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be necessarily met by each prospective portfolio company. In addition, we may change our investment objective, investment strategy and/or investment criteria over time without notice to or consent from our investors.
Investment Criteria and Transactional Structures 
We invest primarily in transactions supported by private equity sponsors. We seek to invest in the following types of assets, with an emphasis on senior debt:
•traditional cash flow senior secured debt;
•unitranche senior secured debt financings;
•“last out” unitranche debt;
•second lien senior debt;
•traditional subordinated debt;
•preferred and common equity co-investments; and
•secondary and other opportunistic asset purchases.
As noted above, we may also from time to time participate in traditional subordinated debt financings, preferred and common equity co-investments. We may also make secondary purchases of all of the above types of investments and other securities on an opportunistic basis.
Investment Process
Origination
The direct lending investment team’s multi-channel origination model generates attractive investment opportunities through a variety of sources, including over 250 private equity firms, financial institutions, other middle market lenders, strategic relationships and arrangements, financial advisors, and experienced management teams. The origination team supplements these relationships through personal visits and marketing campaigns focused on maximizing investment deal flow. It is their responsibility to identify specific opportunities, refine opportunities through candid exploration of the underlying facts and circumstances and to apply creative and flexible solutions to solve a borrower or sponsor’s financing needs. The team of origination professionals are located in New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles. Each originator maintains long-standing relationships with potential sources of deal flow and is responsible for covering a specified target market, organized by geography and secondarily by sector. Carlyle believes the originators’ strengths and breadth of relationships across a wide range of markets generate numerous financing opportunities, which enable it to be highly selective through its diligence and investment process, with less than 3% of total deals screened over the past 12 months closing. The direct lending investment team has cultivated very strong relationships with private equity sponsors with whom it works closely in sourcing and executing transactions. Carlyle believes that borrowers benefit from full financing solutions, access to the vast Carlyle network, and reliable execution.
Underwriting
The underwriting process is led by an experienced team of senior underwriters that are organized by sector and benefit from a deep base of shared information enabled by platform integration, as well as Carlyle resources. The typical deal timeline is sixty to ninety days and follows a multi-faceted four-step process:
1.Screening. The deal team reviews marketing materials and industry reports, compiles debt and equity comparables, reaches out to industry experts within the Carlyle network, identifies key credit strengths and risks and formulates a view on structure. The deal team then presents an initial analysis through a screening memo to the Screening Committee for high-level feedback and a decision to move forward with additional credit work. The Screening Committee is comprised of the Head of Direct Lending, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Head of Sponsor Coverage, Deputy Chief Investment Officer, and two additional senior Managing Directors. Based on feedback from the committee, the deal team will prepare and disseminate an outcomes email that documents the takeaways from the meeting, including preferred financing structure as well as terms, key diligence items and next steps.
2.Formal Review. Following an indication from the Screening Committee to move forward in the diligence process, the deal team will compile a detailed diligence list and prepare for in-depth credit analysis. During this process, the deal team works closely with the private equity sponsor / borrower in all aspects of due diligence. Formal due diligence includes meeting with the management team, reviewing the data room and performing key financial analyses, creating a detailed financial model with sensitivities assuming various market environments, reviewing sell-side and third-party research, which includes industry reports and financial diligence, following up with industry experts within the Carlyle network for additional feedback, and drafting the commitment papers and term sheet. 
As part of the extensive due diligence process, the deal team fully leverages all internal Carlyle resources to aid in investment decisions. In addition, the deal team may utilize third-party expert networks to supplement their work to gain further insight into company and industry factors from various thought leaders across the company’s markets. 
Our Investment Adviser incorporates formal ESG reviews into its investment process. All deals are thoroughly vetted leveraging sector- and sub-sector-specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards. ESG diligence incorporates country risk assessments for corruption and anti-money laundering concerns as well. The underwriters are responsible for assessing these ESG risks and including their assessment in the deal memo that the Screening and Investment Committees will review. 
The formal review part of the process is iterative and involves re-screening with members of the Screening Committee, typically two to four times over the course of the deal, to produce a fulsome investment memo and provide a full term sheet and commitment papers, subject to outstanding diligence items.
3.Final Investment Committee Approval. After the Screening Committee has signed off on the investment memo, the deal team prepares for the Investment Committee approval process. The deal team reviews and summarizes final third-party industry work, performs outstanding ESG and regulatory due diligence, and begins drafting the definitive legal documentation for the transaction. Once the credit work for the transaction has been finalized, the deal team will finalize the investment memo and present the investment to the Investment Committee, where approval by a majority of the committee is required to approve a transaction. The Investment Committee has delegated approval of certain amendments, follow-on investments with existing borrowers, investments below certain size thresholds (existing or new platforms), and other matters as determined by the Investment Committee to the Screening Committee.
4.Closing. Once the investment has been approved and prior to funding, the deal team will prepare a closing memo documenting any updates since approval, changes to key legal terms, and the final financial covenant analysis. Once the sponsor / borrower legal diligence, and the know your customer, anti-money laundering and legal documentation have been finalized, the transaction will close and fund.
The deal team focuses on lending to companies that it believes are performing, high quality businesses with a focus on strong fundamentals, market leadership with unique competitive advantages and high barriers to entry, positive cash flow generation on a historical and pro-forma basis including downside scenarios, and modest loan-to-value across economic cycles. The deal team crafts a fulsome memo with pages including, but not limited to, diligence completed on a variety of industry, company-specific, financial and legal topics. 
Portfolio and Risk Management
The investment team views proactive portfolio monitoring as a vital part of its investment process, which includes the ongoing review of a borrower by portfolio management, underwriting and workout professionals, with multiple layers of risk review and oversight. The investment team follows a rigorous monitoring strategy that utilizes a proprietary dashboard template for each transaction, which tracks financial performance, covenant compliance, follow-on transactions and amendments, and real-time updates to internal risk ratings based on qualitative and quantitative factors. The portfolio management process 
involves a variety of ongoing and scheduled reviews that allow for early detection of issues and escalation to the Investment Committee and workout team to avoid credit losses. This process includes detailed portfolio dashboard updates, monthly reviews of certain investments, quarterly meetings to conduct formal portfolio reviews, focused on technical analysis of financial performance and portfolio diversification, and ongoing ad-hoc meetings to handle borrower-specific requests, including follow-on transactions and amendments.
In connection with the quarterly portfolio reviews, the investment team also compiles a quarterly risk report that examines, among other things, migration in the portfolio and loan level investment mix, industry diversification, internal risk ratings, revenue and EBITDA and leverage.
Frequency of review of individual loans is determined on a case-by-case basis, based on internal risk ratings as laid out below, total exposure and other criteria set forth by the Investment Committee. The direct lending team has developed an internal risk policy which regularly assesses the risk profile of each investment and rates them based on the following categories, which are referred to as internal risk ratings.

Rating | Definition 
 | Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 
 | Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost basis is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 
 | Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 
 | Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan’s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit.
 | Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan’s risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 

Beyond the policies detailed above, our Investment Adviser’s investment team performs analyses and projections to assess potential exposure of the portfolio to variable macroeconomic factors and market conditions. Sample analyses include assessing (i) the impact of rising operating costs on our borrowers and end consumers due to elevated inflation, particularly in food and energy, (ii) volatility in foreign exchange rates, (iii) Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine, (iv) interest rate sensitivity, (v) disruptions in our supply chain and (vi) the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These analyses can take the form of periodic (weekly/monthly/quarterly) reports as well as ad hoc analysis based on current market conditions.

Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest
Our Investment Adviser, its investment professionals, our executive officers and directors, and other current and future principals of our Investment Adviser serve or may serve as investment advisers, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same line of business as we do or a related line of business and/or investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements advised by Carlyle. 
An affiliated investment fund, account or other similar arrangement currently formed or formed in the future and managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. This creates potential conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other investment funds, accounts and similar arrangements, particularly in circumstances where the availability or liquidity of such investment opportunities is limited or where co-investments by us and other funds, accounts or arrangements are not permitted under applicable law, as discussed below.
For example, Carlyle sponsors several investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, including, without limitation, structured credit funds, closed-end registered investment companies, BDCs, carry funds, and managed accounts and 
structured credit funds it may sponsor in the future. The SEC has granted us exemptive relief that permits us and certain of our affiliates to co-invest in suitable negotiated investments (the “Exemptive Relief”). If Carlyle is presented with investment opportunities that generally fall within our investment objective and other board-established criteria and those of other Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements (including other existing and future affiliated BDCs), whether focused on a debt strategy or otherwise, Carlyle allocates such opportunities among us and such other Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements in a manner consistent with the Exemptive Relief, our Investment Adviser’s allocation policies and procedures and Carlyle’s other allocation policies and procedures, where applicable, as discussed below. More specifically, investment opportunities in suitable negotiated investments for investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements managed by our Investment Adviser, and other funds, accounts or similar arrangements managed by affiliated investment advisers that seek to co-invest with us or other Carlyle BDCs, are allocated in accordance with the Exemptive Relief. Investment opportunities for all other investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements not managed by our Investment Adviser are allocated in accordance with their respective investment advisers’ and Carlyle’s other allocation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures may result in certain investment opportunities that are attractive to us being allocated to other funds that are not managed by our Investment Adviser. Carlyle’s, including our Investment Adviser’s, allocation policies and procedures are designed to allocate investment opportunities fairly and equitably among its clients over time, taking into account a variety of factors which may include the sourcing of the transaction, the nature of the investment focus of each such other Carlyle fund, accounts or other similar arrangements, each fund’s, account’s or similar arrangement’s desired level of investment, the relative amounts of capital available for investment, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals, any requirements contained in the limited partnership agreements and other governing agreements of the Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements and other considerations deemed relevant by Carlyle in good faith, including suitability considerations and reputational matters. The application of these considerations may cause differences in the performance of different Carlyle funds, accounts and similar arrangements that have similar strategies.
Because we are a BDC, we are not generally permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Carlyle or other funds managed by Carlyle.
We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with clients of our Investment Adviser or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Carlyle) without complying with our Exemptive Relief, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to our downstream affiliates. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Investment Adviser’s and Carlyle’s other allocation policies and procedures.
While Carlyle and our Investment Adviser seek to implement their respective allocation processes in a fair and equitable manner under the particular circumstances, there can be no assurance that it will result in equivalent allocation of or participation in investment opportunities or equivalent performance of investments allocated to us as compared to the other entities. In some cases, due to information barriers that are in place, we and other Carlyle investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements may compete with each other for specific investment opportunities without being aware that they are competing with each other. Carlyle has a conflict system in place above these information barriers to identify potential conflicts early in the process and determine if an allocation decision needs to be made or if an investment is precluded. If the conflicts system detects a potential conflict, the legal and compliance departments of Carlyle assess investment opportunities to determine whether a particular investment opportunity is required to be allocated to a particular investment fund, account or other similar arrangement (including us) or is prohibited from being allocated to a particular investment fund, account or similar arrangement. Subject to a determination by the legal and compliance departments (if applicable), portfolio management teams and, as applicable, the Investment Adviser's allocation committees, are then charged with ensuring that investment opportunities are allocated to the appropriate investment fund, account or similar arrangement in accordance with our Investment Adviser's allocation policies and procedures. In addition, in some cases Carlyle and our Investment Adviser may make investment recommendations to investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements where the investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements make the investment independently of Carlyle and our Investment Adviser. As a result, there are circumstances where investments appropriate for us are instead allocated, in whole or in part, to such other investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements irrespective of our Investment Adviser’s and Carlyle’s other policies and procedures regarding allocation of investments. Where Carlyle otherwise has discretion to allocate investment opportunities among various funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, it should be noted that Carlyle may determine to allocate such investment opportunities away from us.
During periods of unusual market conditions, our Investment Adviser may deviate from its normal trade allocation practices. For example, this may occur with respect to the management of unlevered and/or long-only investment funds, 
accounts or similar arrangements that are typically managed on a side-by-side basis with levered and/or long-short investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements.
For potential conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities among the Company and other investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements advised by Carlyle, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including the management of other investment funds and accounts by our Investment Adviser, which could impact our investment returns and the holders of our common stock.”
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. Instead, dividends we distribute generally will be taxable to the holders of our common stock, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes may not pass through to the holders of our common stock. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (generally, our net ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction) for any taxable year (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). The following discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we (1) qualify as a RIC, and (2) satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our net taxable income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
In addition, if we fail to distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (the “Excise Tax Distribution Requirements”), we are liable for a 4% excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year is considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). 
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

•continue to qualify as a BDC under the Investment Company Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or foreign currencies (the “90% Gross Income Test”); and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, or two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to raise additional debt or equity capital or sell assets to make distributions, we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, and therefore would not be able to maintain our qualification as a RIC. Additionally, we may make investments that result in the recognition of ordinary income rather than capital gain, or that prevent us from accruing a long-term holding period. These investments may prevent us from 
making capital gain distributions as described below. We intend to monitor our transactions, make the appropriate tax elections and make the appropriate entries in our books and records when we make any such investments in order to mitigate the effect of these rules.
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income, we would have a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, a holder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than the holder would have received in the absence of such transactions.
Regulation
General—Regulation as a Business Development Company
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A publicly-traded BDC provides stockholders with the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not “interested persons,” as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (such directors are referred to as the “Independent Directors” and the directors who are not Independent Directors are referred to as the “Interested Directors”). We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to certain transactions between BDCs and certain affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and certain affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. Because we are a BDC, we are not generally permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Carlyle or other funds managed by Carlyle. We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with our Investment Adviser or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Carlyle) without complying with our Exemptive Relief, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to our downstream affiliates. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Investment Adviser’s allocation policies and procedures.
As a BDC, we are generally required to meet a minimum “asset coverage” ratio after each issuance of senior securities. “Asset coverage” generally refers to a company’s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by “senior securities,” as defined in the Investment Company Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. “Senior securities” for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. On April 9, 2018 and June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act), and our stockholders, respectively, approved the application to us of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage 
ratio applicable to us was reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of June 7, 2018, the first day after our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants or options to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financings or other investments. In connection with such an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances.
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company (unless certain conditions are satisfied), invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intended status to be a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” for more information.
On April 12, 2022, we changed our name from TCG BDC, Inc. to Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. In connection therewith, we have adopted a policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments or instruments that provide investment exposure to secured debt investments, including through investment vehicles that typically invest at least 80% of their total assets in secured debt investments. This policy may be changed with 60 days’ prior notice to our shareholders. None of our investment policies are fundamental, and thus may be changed without shareholder approval.
In addition, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the Investment Company Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions.
We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value ("NAV") per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV of our common stock if our Independent Directors determine that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Independent Directors, closely approximates the market value of such shares (less any distributing commission or discount). In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below NAV in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. Pursuant to approval granted at a special meeting of stockholders held on August 3, 2022, we are authorized, with the approval of the Board of Directors, to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current NAV per share, subject to certain limitations (including that the number of shares issued does not exceed 25% of our then-outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering). Such stockholder approval expires on August 3, 2023. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage” and “—The NAV per share of our common stock may be diluted if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock.”
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure.”
Qualifying Assets
As a BDC, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered “eligible portfolio companies” (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
    As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide, upon request from our portfolio companies, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Investment Adviser may provide all or a portion of this assistance pursuant to our administration agreement, the costs of which will be reimbursed by us. We may receive fees for these services.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as “temporary investments,” so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may also invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Indebtedness and Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage” and “—We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.”
Codes of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and our Investment Adviser has adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively (collectively, the “Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics”), which establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions and apply to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Rule 17j-1Codes of Ethics generally do not permit investments by personnel subject to them in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. The Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics are filed with the SEC (www.sec.gov).
We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SOX Code of Ethics”), which applies to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The SOX Code of Ethics is available free of charge on our website (http://www.tcgbdc.com).
 There have been no material changes to the Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics or the SOX Code of Ethics or material waivers of the codes that apply to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and our Investment Adviser have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
•pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to material weaknesses.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. These guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our Independent Directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Investment Adviser recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Our Investment Adviser will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Investment Adviser will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our Investment Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Our Investment Adviser’s proxy voting decisions will be made by its investment committee. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Investment Adviser will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to the Investment Committee, and Independent Directors, any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision 
making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Investment Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Stockholders may obtain information regarding how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc., c/o Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C., One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017.

We endeavor to maintain the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguard their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help stockholders understand what non-public personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share that information with select other parties.
We may collect non-public personal information about stockholders from our subscription agreements or other forms, such as name, address, account number and the types and amounts of investments, and information about transactions with us or our affiliates, such as participation in other investment programs, ownership of certain types of accounts or other account data and activity. We may disclose the non-public personal information that we collect from our stockholders or former stockholders, as described above, to our affiliates and service providers and as allowed by applicable law or regulation. Any party that receives this information from us is permitted to use it only for the services required by us and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose. We permit access only by authorized personnel who need access to that non-public personal information to provide services to us and our stockholders.

Compliance with Listing Requirements
Our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CGBD” on June 14, 2017. As a listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we are subject to various listing standards including corporate governance listing standards. We monitor our compliance with all listing standards and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Reporting Obligations and Available Information
We furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as well as reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 regarding directors, officers or 10% beneficial owners of us, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website (http://www.carlylesecuredlending.com).
The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including us, which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.
Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, CLOs, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that will not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we will face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.
We expect to use the expertise of the members of the Investment Committee and its investment team to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments. In addition, we expect that extensive direct origination resources, broad product capabilities, ability to commit capital in scale and the depth of expertise of our Investment Adviser’s investment team will enable us to learn about and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and compete with investment vehicles sponsored or advised by our affiliates.”
Staffing
We do not currently have any employees. Our Chief Financial Officer, a Managing Director of Carlyle, our Treasurer and Principal Accounting Officer, a Vice President of Carlyle, and our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, a Managing Director of Carlyle, are retained by our Administrator pursuant to the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement.

Our Investment Adviser may hire additional investment professionals to provide services to us.
