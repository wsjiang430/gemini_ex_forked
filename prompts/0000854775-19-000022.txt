ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Background and Product Offerings
Digi International Inc. ("Digi," "we," "our," or "us") was incorporated in 1985 as a Minnesota corporation. We were reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol DGII. Our World Headquarters is located at 9350 Excelsior Blvd., Suite 700, Hopkins, Minnesota 55343. The telephone number at our World Headquarters is (952) 912-3444. 
We are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical Internet of Things ("IoT") connectivity products, services and solutions. We help our customers create next-generation connected products and solutions to deploy, monitor and manage critical communications infrastructures and compliance standards in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. We have two reportable operating segments under applicable accounting standards: (i) IoT Products & Services segment; and (ii) IoT Solutions segment. 
Our IoT Products & Services segment offers products and services that help original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), enterprise and government customers create and deploy, secure IoT connectivity solutions. From embedded and wireless modules to console servers, enterprise and industrial routers, we provide customers with a wide variety of communication sub-assemblies and finished products to meet their IoT communication requirements. In addition, the IoT Products & Services segment provides our customers with a device management platform and other professional services to enable customers to capture and manage data from devices they connect to networks. 
Our IoT Solutions segment offers wireless temperature and other condition-based monitoring services as well as employee task management services. These solutions are focused on the following vertical markets: food service, retail, healthcare (primarily pharmacies), transportation/logistics and education. These solutions are marketed as SmartSense by Digi™. We have formed, expanded and enhanced the IoT Solutions segment through four acquisitions. 
For more in-depth descriptions of our products and services, please refer to the heading "Principal Products and Services" at the end of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
Our corporate website address is www.digi.com. In the "Company - Investor Relations" section of our website, we make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statement and any amendments to these reports available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
Industry and Marketplace Conditions
Current Market Conditions and Status of Our Business
We believe the IoT industry is in the midst of a long-term expansion as many industries are undergoing a digital transformation within their business that drives demand for IoT capabilities across a broad spectrum of services. IoT use cases include automating workflows, condition-based monitoring and asset tracking. 
The performance of our IoT Products & Services segment in fiscal 2019, which is the significant majority of our sales, experienced growth. This growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of Accelerated Concepts, Inc. ("Accelerated") in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, new product introductions and large customer deployments. This segment sells both wired and wireless products that are either embedded into the products of OEMs or as stand-alone products. These offerings allow our customers to connect a wide range of assets to networks. The growth of this segment was not universal across all products. For instance, the segment has a number of products that are in the mature phase of their life cycle and have been experiencing sales declines for several years. While we expect an ongoing trend of marketplace growth, it is susceptible to downturns either because of general economic conditions, the continued development of technology that can make products less competitive or even obsolete and uncertainty or changes in regulatory environments. Sales of many of our products are also subject to large project-based customer deployments. As such, if we are unable to identify and commence new deployments with equal or greater significance than completed projects, our growth from period to period may be inconsistent and this segment may contract in any given period.
1

Our IoT Solutions segment continued to experience significant growth in fiscal 2019 as we continue to integrate the acquisitions we have made in this segment and offer more comprehensive task management monitoring solutions to our customers. In September 2019, we launched a new SmartSense IoT Platform. This new platform integrates the platforms from the acquisitions and provides redesigned multi-sensor monitoring and reporting that affords users enhanced equipment management abilities with an asset-versus-sensor focus. The new platform is capable of further incorporating data from multiple sensor types into a single monitoring and reporting platform, to deliver real-time and detailed information on critical business assets and equipment. 
Strategy
We continue to take significant steps intended to deliver consistent long-term growth with higher levels of profitability. 
IoT Products & Services Segment
Our IoT Products & Services segment is being managed with an expectation for modest revenue and profitability growth. We recently have focused more attention on pairing our hardware offerings with our Digi Remote Manager® device management platform as well as other support services. These bundled offerings allow customers to monitor and manage the performance of our hardware remotely. We may seek to acquire hardware or other businesses that we believe can improve our market position in this segment.
IoT Solutions Segment
Our IoT Solutions segment is being managed primarily for significant revenue growth. This segment was formed and has grown primarily through acquisitions. While this segment still represents a modest overall portion of total revenues, we have high organic growth expectations and we intend to seek added scale and growth through acquisitions.
This business helps customers monitor temperature and other conditions important to preserve the quality of perishable or other sensitive inventories and tracks the completion of employee tasks. Our efforts have created a market-leading, high-growth hardware enabled service business with significant recurring revenue potential. At present this marketplace primarily is served by smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to provide hardware-enabled implementation services to customers in as effective and efficient a manner as we are able to do because of our long-standing history as an IoT hardware provider. 
We now serve over 63,000 customer sites for many leading brands in the following vertical markets: food service, retail, healthcare (primarily pharmacies), transportation/logistics and education. We entered these markets aggressively as they share similar needs for continuous monitoring and asset tracking for compliance and regulatory purposes. We believe these markets comprise a large addressable market with low customer penetration. 
Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisitions
Since fiscal 2015, we have acquired four businesses that form the basis of our IoT Solutions segment and one business that is included in our IoT Products and Services segment.
In October 2015, we acquired Ontario-based Bluenica Corporation ("Bluenica"). Bluenica focused on temperature monitoring of perishable goods in the food industry by using wireless sensors to ensure that quality, freshness and public health requirements are met.
In November 2016, we acquired Pittsburgh-based FreshTemp, LLC ("FreshTemp®"). FreshTemp® offered restaurants, convenience stores and other retailers the ability to monitor the temperature of food products automatically through the use of wireless sensors. The company also enabled these businesses to track the completion of operational tasks by their employees that could impact human health and safety in real time.
In January 2017, we acquired Indiana-based SMART Temps,LLC (" SMART Temps®"). SMART Temps® provided real-time temperature management for restaurant, grocery, education and healthcare settings. The acquisition significantly expanded our customer base, especially in the pharmacy and education marketplaces.
In October 2017, we acquired Boston-based TempAlert, LLC ("TempAlert"), a provider of automated, real-time temperature monitoring and task management solutions for the healthcare, industrial and food service industries. This acquisition more than doubled the number of customer sites we monitored while enhancing our ability to analyze data collected from our services.

In January 2018, we acquired Tampa-based Accelerated, a provider of secure, enterprise-grade, cellular (LTE) networking equipment and backup connectivity applications. This acquisition expanded our IoT Products and Services segment by enhancing our existing cellular product lines and extended our market reach with a line of commercial routers and network appliance products. 
In November 2019, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire New Jersey-based Opengear, Inc., a provider of secure IT infrastructure products and software. This acquisition provides products that are complementary to our IoT Products and Services segment.
Disposition
In October 2015, we sold our Etherios CRM consulting services business to West Monroe Partners, LLC. We sold Etherios as part of a strategy to focus on providing highly reliable machine connectivity solutions for business and mission-critical application environments.
These are the only acquisitions and dispositions we have completed in the past five years. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire businesses as they arise and may seek to divest businesses or assets we no longer consider appropriate to our long-term strategy.
Sales Channels
A significant portion of our IoT Products & Services segment sales are made through a global network of distributors, systems integrators and value added resellers ("VARs"). These third parties accounted for 46.1%, 51.3% and 61.6% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our IoT Solutions segment does not sell through these channels. We also complete sales of both IoT Products & Services and IoT Solutions through our own dedicated sales organization to OEMs, large enterprise customers and other end user customers which accounted for 53.9%, 48.7% and 38.4% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Distributors
Our larger distributors, by sales volume, include Anewtech Systems, Arrow Electronics, Atlantik Elektronik GmbH, Avnet, Digi-Key, Express Systems & Peripherals, Ingram Micro, Miel, Mouser Electronics, Sapply, Solid State Supplies, Symmetry Electronics, Synnex, Tech Data and Tokyo Electron Device. We also maintain relationships with many other distributors in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Strategic Sales Relationships 
We maintain alliances with other industry leaders to develop and market technology solutions. These include many major communications hardware and software vendors, operating system suppliers, computer hardware manufacturers, enterprise application providers and cellular carriers. Among others, relationships include: AT&T, Bell Mobility, NXP, Orange, Rogers, Silicon Laboratories, Sprint, Telus, Telit, T-Mobile, Verizon, Vodafone and several other cellular carriers worldwide. 
We have established relationships with equipment vendors in a range of industries such as energy, industrial, retail, transportation, medical, and government that allow these partners to ship our products and services as component parts of their overall solutions. Our products are used by many of the world’s leading telecommunications companies and Internet service providers, including AT&T, Sprint and Verizon.
No single customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for any of the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 or 2017.
Competition
We compete primarily in the communications technology industry. This industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. This market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. In addition, we may compete with other companies to acquire new businesses or technologies and the competition to secure such assets may be intense. We compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features, service and software application capabilities, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, alliance relationships, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price and availability. While no competitor offers a comparable range of products and services, various companies do compete with us with respect to one or more of our products or solutions. With respect to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who dedicate more resources and attention to that particular offering than we are able to do given the breadth of our

business. As the marketplace for IoT connectivity products and solutions continues to grow, we expect to encounter increased competition. Some of these competitors may have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess.
Manufacturing Operations
We outsource our manufacturing operations to certain contract manufacturers, which are located primarily in Thailand, China, Mexico and Taiwan. We rely on third party foundries for our semiconductor devices that are Application Specific Integrated Circuits ("ASICs"). We also outsource printed circuit board production. By outsourcing our operations to these manufacturers, we can leverage the manufacturing strength of our vendors and allow us to focus on new product introductions. In addition, it allows us to reduce our fixed costs, maintain production flexibility and optimize our profits. 
Our products are manufactured to our designs with standard and custom components. Most of the components are available from multiple vendors. We have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. If these suppliers are unable to provide a timely and reliable supply of components, we could experience manufacturing delays that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a material way.
Seasonality
In general, our business is not considered to be highly seasonal, although our first fiscal quarter revenue is often less than other quarters due to holidays and fewer shipping days. 
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations. We believe that our current financial resources, cash generated from operations and our capacity for debt and/or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations for the next twelve months and beyond.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property Rights
Due to rapidly changing technology in the communications technology industry, we believe a large part of our success depends upon the product and service development skills of our personnel as well as our ability to integrate any acquired technologies with organically developed technologies. While we dedicate significant resources to research and development, many of our competitors are focused on a smaller set of products than us and are likely able to dedicate more resources than us toward the portions of the market in which we compete with them. 
Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks.
We have established common law and registered trademark rights on a family of marks for a number of our products. Our IoT Products and Services primarily are sold under the Digi, Rabbit® and Digi XBee® brands. We believe that the Digi and Rabbit® brands have established strong identities with our targeted customer base and our customers associate the Digi brand with "reliability" and the Rabbit® brand with "ease of integration." We believe that our customers associate Digi XBee® with "ease of use." Many of our customers choose us because they are building a very complex system solution and they want the highest level in product reliability and ease of integration and use. Our IoT Solutions are offered under the SmartSense by Digi™ brand, which enables organizations to drive operational excellence through sensor-based insights.
Our patents are applicable to specific technologies and are valid for varying periods of time based on the date of patent application or patent grant in the U.S. and the legal term of patents in the various foreign countries where patent protection is obtained. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company and products.
Backlog
Backlog as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $39.8 million and $34.4 million, respectively. The majority of the backlog at September 30, 2019 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2020. Backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of our future sales trends.
Employees
We had 543 employees on September 30, 2019.
