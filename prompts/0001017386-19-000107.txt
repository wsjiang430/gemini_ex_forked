FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS; This annual report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve risks and uncertainties. In addition, Judo Capital Corp. (formerly Classic Rules Judo, Inc.) (the “Company” or “Judo”), may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Actual results are uncertain and may be impacted by many factors. In particular, certain risks and uncertainties that may impact the accuracy of the forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, expenses and operating results include without limitation; cycles of customer orders, general economic and competitive conditions and changing customer trends, technological advances and the number and timing of new product introductions, shipments of products and components from foreign suppliers, and changes in the mix of products ordered by customers. As a result, the actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
 
Because of these and other factors that may affect the Company’s operating results, past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Our Business
 
On June 2, 2014, the Company ceased its principal activities of hosting and sponsoring judo tournaments. The Company had planned to operate in real estate investment activities focused in the New York City metropolitan area.  On February 28, 2018, the Company ceased its plans to operate in the real estate investment activities. The Company is seeking to consummate a merger or acquisition.
Government Regulation
 
The Company is, and will continue to be, subject to several and varying governmental regulations. In general, the Company is subject to environmental, public health and safety, land use, trade and other governmental regulations, and national, state, or local taxation or tariffs. The Company’s management will endeavor to ascertain and comply with all applicable to the business of the Company. However, it may not be possible to predict with any degree of accuracy all applicable regulations or the impact of government regulation, and, compliance with such regulation will require certain efforts and resources of the Company.
 
a) Penny Stock Regulations: Our shares are "penny stocks" covered by Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 and Rule 15g-9 promulgated thereunder. They impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). While Section 15(g) and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 apply to brokers-dealers, they do not apply to us.
 
Rule 15g-1 exempts a number of specific transactions from the scope of the penny stock rules.
 
Rule 15g-2 declares unlawful broker/dealer transactions in penny stocks unless the broker/dealer has first provided to the customer a standardized disclosure document.
 
Rule 15g-3 provides that it is unlawful for a broker/dealer to engage in a penny stock transaction unless the broker/dealer first discloses and subsequently confirms to the customer current quotation prices or similar market information concerning the penny stock in question.
 
Rule 15g-4 prohibits broker/dealers from completing penny stock transactions for a customer unless the broker/dealer first discloses to the customer the amount of compensation or other remuneration received as a result of the penny stock transaction.

Rule 15g-5 requires that a broker/dealer executing a penny stock transaction, other than one exempt under Rule 15g-1, disclose to its customer, at the time of or prior to the transaction, information about the sales persons compensation.
 
Rule 15g-6 requires broker/dealers selling penny stocks to provide their customers with monthly account statements.
 
Rule 15g-9 requires broker/dealers to approve the transaction for the customer's account; obtain a written agreement from the customer setting forth the identity and quantity of the stock being purchased; obtain from the customer information regarding his investment experience; make a determination that the investment is suitable for the investor; deliver to the customer a written statement for the basis for the suitability determination; notify the customer of his rights and remedies in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions; and, the FINRA's toll free telephone number and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers and their associated persons. The application of the penny stock rules may affect your ability to resell your shares.
 
The FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker/dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.  Under interpretations of these rules, the FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock.  Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock.
 
Again, the foregoing rules apply to broker/dealers. They do not apply to us in any manner whatsoever. Since our shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers, many broker/dealers may not want to make a market in our shares or conduct any transactions in our shares. As such, your ability to dispose of your shares may be adversely affected.
 
b) Blue Sky Restrictions on Resale: If a selling security holder wants to sell shares of our common stock under this registration statement in the United States, the selling security holders will also need to comply with state securities laws, also known as "Blue Sky laws," with regard to secondary sales. All states offer a variety of exemption from registration for secondary sales. Many states, for example, have an exemption for secondary trading of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or for securities of issuers that publish continuous disclosure of financial and non-financial information in a recognized securities manual, such as Standard & Poor's. The broker for a selling security holder will be able to advise a selling security holder which states our common stock is exempt from registration with that state for secondary sales.
 
Any person who purchases shares of our common stock from a selling security holder under this registration statement who then wants to sell such shares will also have to comply with Blue Sky laws regarding secondary sales. When the registration statement becomes effective, and a selling security holder indicates in which state(s) he desires to sell his shares, we will be able to identify whether it will need to register or it will rely on an exemption there from.
 
Employees
 
The Company presently has no employees other than its officers and directors. Management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys, and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to hire any full-time employees until absolutely necessary for the operations of the Company. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the scope and requirements of the operations of the Company.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had no employees other than our officer and director. We anticipate that we will not hire any employees in the next twelve months, unless we generate significant revenues.
