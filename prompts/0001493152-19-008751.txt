ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Quest Solution, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly Amerigo Energy, Inc., together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to herein as “we,” “us,” and “our” (“Quest” or the “Company”), was incorporated in 1973. Since its incorporation, the Company has been involved in various lines of business.
History
 
Between 2008 and 2013, the Company was in the business of developing oil and gas reserves while increasing the production rate base and cash flow. The plan was to continue acquiring oil and gas leases for drilling and to take advantage of other opportunities and strategic alliances. Due to declines in production with respect to the Company’s oil and gas leases, the Company sought to explore its position in the oil industry. As the operational leases for the Company were not providing sufficient cash flow from operations to allow management to expand its investment in this industry, other potential opportunities were evaluated.
 
In January 2014, the Company had determined it was in the best interest of stockholders to focus on operating companies with a track record of positive cash flows and larger existing revenue bases. The Company’s strategy developed into leveraging management’s relationships in the business world for investments for the Company. On January 10, 2014, the Company entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement with Quest Solution, Inc., an Oregon corporation (“Quest Solution”), in the technology, software, and mobile data collection systems business, in order to acquire Quest Solution for a purchase price of $16,000,000, payable in the form of (i) a promissory note for $4,969,000; and (ii) a promissory note for $11,031,000.
 
On November 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Bar Code Specialties, Inc., a California corporation (“BCS”), and David Marin, the sole stockholder of BCS, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of BCS held by Mr. Marin for an aggregate purchase price of $10,396,316, payable in the form of a five-year secured subordinated convertible promissory note. BCS is a company specializing in systems integration and data collection. Initially the Company focused on the distribution vertical, but quickly grew its operational focus to include retail, manufacturing, food, and healthcare.
 
Effective October 1, 2015, the Company acquired the interest in ViascanQdata, Inc. (“ViascanQData”), a Canadian based operation in the same business line as Quest. The purchase price for the shares of ViascanQdata was 5,200,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (which were convertible on a 1:1 basis into common shares, with no other preferential rights) as well as a promissory note of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000).
 
Effective September 30, 2016, the Company sold all of the outstanding shares of Quest Solution Canada Inc., and the consideration received was $1.0 million in cash of which $575,000 was received at closing and the balance was received on April 30, 2017. In addition, the Company has redeemed 1 share of Preferred Class B Stock and 1,839,030 shares of Preferred Class C Stock of the Company, as well as the accrued dividend of $31,742 thereon. Lastly, Quest Exchange Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, redeemed 5,200,000 exchangeable shares as part of the divestiture.
 
Additionally, as part of the transaction, Viascan Group Inc., the acquirer, assumed $1.0 million of liabilities which the Company had at September 30, 2016. Other consideration that is part of the transaction includes:
 

● | Full release from five employment contracts, inclusive of the former CEO, Gilles Gaudreault. This release included cancelation of the contracts as well as the deferred salary and signing bonus provisions which would have inured to the employee. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company cancelled the intercompany debts of approximately $7.0 million as well. The Company will also receive a contingent consideration of 15% of the net value proceeds, up to a maximum of $2.3 million, received upon a liquidity event or a change of control of Quest Solution Canada Inc. for a period of 7 years subsequent to the transaction. 
● | The Company also negotiated a right of first refusal for any offer to purchase Quest Solution Canada Inc. for a 7 year period. 

 
Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company learned that Quest Solution Canada, Inc. was sold and the Company is pursuing a claim for its percentage of the transaction proceeds and other damages.
 
On February 26, 2018, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with David and Kathy Marin whereby it cancelled the lease for the premises located at 12272 Monarch St., Garden Grove, California effective as of April 20, 2018.

On February 28, 2018, the Company entered into two settlement agreements with David and Kathy Marin (the “Marin Settlement Agreements”). Pursuant to the first Marin Settlement Agreement (the “Marin Settlement Agreement I”), the Company and the Marins agreed to reduce the Company’s purchase price for all of the capital stock of Bar Code Specialties, Inc., which was acquired by the Company from the Marins in November 2014. In the 2014 acquisition, the Company had issued David Marin a promissory note for $11,000,000 of which an aggregate of $10,696,465.17 (the “Owed Amount”) was outstanding as of February 26, 2018 which includes accrued interest earned but not paid. Pursuant to the Marin Settlement I Agreement, the amount of the indebtedness owed to Marin was reduced by $9,495,465.17 bringing the total amount owed to $1,201,000. Section 3.1 of the original note was amended to provide that the Company shall pay the Marins 60 monthly payments of $20,000 each commencing the earlier of (i) October 26, 2018 and (ii) the date that the Company’s obligation to Scansource, Inc., currently in the amount of $2,800,000 is satisfied and all amounts currently in default under the credit agreement with Scansource (currently approximately $ 6.0 Million) is reduced to $2.0 million. The Marins released their security interest against the Company. In connection with the $9,495,465.17 reduction in the purchase price, the Company issued the Marins 3 year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per-share.
 
On February 28, 2018, the Company entered into an additional settlement agreement with the Marins (the “Marin Settlement Agreement II”) whereby the Company settled a promissory note owed to the Marins in the original principal amount of $100,000 which currently had a balance of $111,064.69 in its entirety in exchange for an aggregate of 85,000 shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock has a liquidation value and conversion price of $1.00 per share and automatically converts into Common Stock at $1.00 per share in the event that the Company’s common stock has a closing price of $1.50 per share for 20 consecutive trading days. The preferred stock pays a 6% dividend commencing two years from issuance. During the first two years, the Series C Preferred stock shall neither pay nor accrue the dividend. The Company also agreed to transfer title to a vehicle that was being utilized by Mr. Marin to David Marin. In exchange therefor, the $100,000 Note and the accrued interest thereon was cancelled in its entirety.
 
Each of the Marins, Thomet and Zicman entered into a voting agreement with the Company whereby they agreed to vote any shares of common stock beneficially owned by them as directed by the Company’s CEO and also agreed to a leakout restriction whereby they each agreed not to sell more than 10% of the common stock beneficially owned during any 30-day period.
 
On June 7, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Jason Griffith, a creditor and principal stockholder of the Company. Griffith is the owner of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1.25 million plus he is owed accrued interest of $125,000 and is owed an additional $215,000 of accrued dividends on his Series C Preferred Stock (the $1,615,000 as calculated above is collectively referred to as the “Owed Amount”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Griffith will convert the Owed Amount into 8,600,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock and the Owed Amount will be deemed satisfied in full. Griffith will continue to retain ownership of his 1,800,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock except that he agrees that all accrued dividends are deemed satisfied and no dividends will be payable or will accrue on these preferred shares until one year from the date of the Settlement Agreement and the Preferred Shares will be convertible into Common Stock at $1.00 per share at the holder’s option and will be automatically convertible into common stock if the Company’s common stock has a closing price of $1.50 per share for 20 consecutive trading days. Griffith has agreed that he will not publicly sell more than 10% of any Shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by him in any 30-day period.
 
On October 5, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “HTS Purchase Agreement”) with Walefar Investments, Ltd. (“Walefar”) and Campbeltown Consulting, Ltd. (“Campbeltown”) (Walefar and Campbeltown are collectively referred to as the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the HTS Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased 100% of the capital stock of HTS Image Processing, Inc. (“HTS”) from the Sellers. As consideration, the Company (i) issued to the Sellers 22,452,954 shares of the Company’s common stock, having a value of $5,298,897 based on the average closing price of the common stock for the 20 days’ preceding the HTS Purchase Agreement (the “Per Share Value”), (ii) cash in the amount of $300,000, and (iii) a 12 month convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $700,000 and an interest rate of six percent (6%) per year. The note also provides the Sellers the right to convert all or any portion of the then outstanding and unpaid principal amount and interest into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.236. The HTS Purchase Agreement constitutes a “related party transaction” because of Company director Shai Lustgarten’s position as Chief Executive Officer of HTS and stock ownership in HTS. Additionally, Campbeltown is a “related party” because Carlos Jaime Nissenson, the beneficial owner of Campbeltown, is a consultant to the Company, a principal stockholder of the Company, and father of Company director Neev Nissenson. Carlos Jaime Nissenson was also a stockholder and director of HTS. Pursuant to the agreement, Shai Lustgarten received 11,226,477 shares of the Company’s common stock and Carlos Jaime Nissenson received 11,226,477 shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
On May 29, 2019, the Company, Campbeltown and Walefar entered into an Amendment to the HTS Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”), which provided for an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock issued to Walefar and Campbeltown in the acquisition of HTS. Pursuant to the Amendment, Campbeltown and Walefar agreed to return for cancelation 5,542,328 and 5,542,329 shares of common stock respectively. This Amendment reduced the amount of shares issued in the acquisition to 11,368,297 shares from 22,452,954 shares and the amount of share consideration to approximately $2,682,918 from approximately $5,298,897. This adjustment was made as a result of a correction in the calculation of working capital and other share give back provisions of the HTS Purchase Agreement. This Amendment also reduces the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock to 77,008,411 from 88,093,068 as of May 29, 2019.
 
On April 4, 2019, the Company entered into a form of Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with accredited investors (the “Purchasers”). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, on April 9, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the Company sold an aggregate, with the Conversions included, of $5,000,000 of units (the “Units”) resulting in gross proceeds of $5,000,000, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses (the “Offering”). The individual Unit purchase price was $0.30. Each Unit is comprised of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), and a warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock, and, as a result of the Offering, the Company issued 16,666,667 shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”) and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase 16,666,667 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrant Shares”) at an exercise price equal to $0.35 per Warrant Share, which Warrants are exercisable for a period of five and one-half years from the issuance date. Both Shai Lustgarten, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Carlos J. Nissenson, a consultant to and principal stockholder of the Company, participated in the Offering by converting $200,000 each of unpaid principal owed to them from the HTS acquisition (the “Conversions”), by the Company in exchange for Shares and Warrants on the same terms as all other Purchasers. With the Conversions included, the Offering resulted in gross proceeds of $5,000,000. As a result of the Conversions, a principal amount of $150,000 is owed to each Walefar and Campbeltown respectively under the note issued to them as partial consideration in the sale of HTS Image Processing to the Company on October 5, 2018.

Target Markets
 
The two markets the Company serves are Smart/Safe City and Supply Chain Management. Quest’s groundbreaking AI-based vision solutions are currently in use for sensitive Homeland Security anti-terror projects and discerning customers within the access control, airport, border crossing, municipality safety and parking industries. Quest seeks to utilize its expertise and end-to-end software solutions in markets which we believe provide the greatest opportunity to increase margins.
 
Within the Supply Chain Management market, Quest believes it can further develop its existing customer base that is in need of replacing their legacy systems with a new go-to-market strategy that leverages our field sales and system resources, telemarketing, customer portals and vertical market and barcode label specialists.

The Company believes that integrating its new patented and proprietary AI technology into its existing Supply Chain offerings will allow for automated logistics monitoring and optimization, creating operational efficiencies at the higher margins associated with the AI value-creation paradigm for both Quest and its fortune 1000 clientele.
 
Competitive overview
 
The mobile system integration market is characterized by a limited number of large competitors and numerous smaller niche players. Quest typically pursues larger accounts and national customers, competing most often with the larger channel partners, including Stratix, Peak Technologies, Lowry, and Barcoding Inc. For specific solutions, the Company also competes with niche players that are often focused on a single industry. Hardware sales are often pressured by competition from online retailers, but the Company believes that its consultative, integrated solutions approach is a clear differentiator for most prospective customers.
 
Sales Strategy
 
The Company’s current direct sales teams are supported by systems engineers averaging over twenty (20) years of experience in the mobile industry. The sales organization’s growth in reach mirrors the Company’s addition of new products and services. Sales team members are organized by industry areas of opportunity, areas of expertise and territory. Quest’s sales teams are organized to address national accounts offering a broad array of unique solutions for key lines of business applications, which allows for upsell and cross sell opportunities to our clients. For the barcode label (media) business, Quest utilizes a specialty sales force as well as action as resellers and distributors of Quest manufactured label products to serve the market.
 
Sales persons are supported internally by sales support personnel who coordinate quotes and logistics and by members of the systems engineering group and software teams.
 
The normal sales cycle is one (1) to six (6) months, and typically involves the development of a scope of work and preparation of a ROI analysis. Quest prepares templates for this purpose which reduces the sales cycle. The analyses and proposals include information on leasing and other financing options, which helps differentiate the Company from its competitors. The label business sales cycles are shorter with purchases made more frequently on a transactional basis.
