Item 1.
Business. 
 General
 Originally founded in 1965, M-tron Industries, Inc. (the "Company," "MtronPTI," "we," "us," or "our") is engaged in the designing, manufacturing and marketing of highly engineered, high reliability frequency and spectrum control products used to control the frequency or timing of signals in electronic circuits in various applications. MtronPTI’s primary markets are defense, aerospace, space, and avionics.
 Our component-level devices and modules are used extensively in electronic systems for applications in commercial and military defense, aerospace, avionics, earth-orbiting satellites, down-hole drilling, medical devices, instrumentation, industrial devices and global positioning systems as well as in infrastructure equipment for the telecommunications and network equipment industries. As an engineering-centric company, MtronPTI provides close support to the customer throughout its products' entire life cycles, including product design, prototyping, production and subsequent product upgrades and maintenance. This collaborative approach has resulted in the development and growth of long-standing business relationships with its blue-chip customer base.
 All of MtronPTI’s production facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified and Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) compliant. In addition, its U.S. production facilities in Orlando, Florida and Yankton, South Dakota are International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) registered and AS9100 Rev D certified and our Yankton, South Dakota production facility is MIL-STD-790 certified.
 We maintain our executive offices at 2525 Shader Road, Orlando, Florida 32804. Our telephone number is (407) 298-2000. Our Internet address is www.mtronpti.com. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE American (“NYSE”) under the symbol "MPTI".
 Impact of MtronPTI’s Separation
 On August 3, 2022, The LGL Group, Inc. (“LGL Group” or “LGL”) announced that its board of directors approved the previously announced separation of the MtronPTI business into an independent, publicly traded company (the "Separation"). Prior to the Separation, LGL Group operated its electronic instruments business segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Precise Time and Frequency, LLC (“PTF”) and its electronic components business segment through MtronPTI.
 On October 7, 2022 (the “Distribution Date”), the Separation of the MtronPTI business was completed and the Company became an independent, publicly traded company trading on the NYSE American under the stock symbol "MPTI." 
 The Separation was completed through LGL Group’s distribution (the “Distribution”) of 100% of the shares of the Company’s common stock to holders of LGL Group's common stock as of the close of business on September 30, 2022, the record date for the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, LGL Group's stockholders of record received 
 1

one-half share of the Company's common stock for every share of LGL Group's common stock held by them. LGL Group retained no ownership interest in the Company following the Separation.
 In connection with the Separation, the Company wrote off $4,439,000 of intercompany receivables due from LGL Group, which brought intercompany balances to zero, and also made a cash payment of approximately $6,000 to LGL Group on October 7, 2022, bringing the Company’s cash balance to $1,000,000 as of the date of the Separation. The Company also issued 50,329 restricted shares of common stock to MtronPTI management as replacement awards for their unvested restricted shares of common stock of LGL Group, keeping the original vesting and other existing terms for each grant. The Company also issued a grant of options to purchase 9,710 shares of common stock at a strike price of $13.10 per share to a member of MtronPTI management as a replacement award for an unvested option award of LGL Group, keeping the original vesting and other existing terms for the grant.
 The Company entered into several agreements with LGL Group that, among other things, effected the Separation and govern the relationship of the parties following the Separation, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, and a Transition Services Agreement. For additional information, see Note A – Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report.
 The Separation of MtronPTI will allow the Company to tailor its strategic plans and growth opportunities, more efficiently raise and allocate resources, including capital raised through debt or equity offerings, provide flexibility to use its own stock as currency for incentive compensation and potential acquisitions and provide investors a more targeted investment opportunity.
 Business Strategy
 Our objective is to deliver long-term growth to our shareholders and maximize shareholder value. MtronPTI employs a market-based approach of designing and offering new products to its customers through both organic research and development, and through strategic partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions, or mergers. We seek to leverage our core strength as an engineering leader to expand client access, add new capabilities and continue to diversify our product offerings. We believe that successful execution of this strategy will lead to a transformation of our product portfolio towards multi-component integrated offerings, longer product life cycles, better margins and improved competitive position.
Business Segment 
 The Company conducts its business through one business segment: Electronic Components, which includes all products manufactured and sold by MtronPTI. 
 Products
 MtronPTI's portfolio is divided into two product groupings, Frequency Control and Spectrum Control, and has expanded from primarily crystal-based components to include higher levels of integration, advanced materials science, cavity-based products, and various types of compensation methods employing integrated circuits and other methods to create products geared for applications that require high reliability in harsh environments. These products are differentiated by their precise level of accuracy, stability over time and within harsh environments, and very low phase noise.
 MtronPTI's Frequency Control product group includes a broad portfolio of quartz crystal resonators, clock oscillators, VCXO, TCXO OCXO and TCVCXO devices which meet some of the tightest specifications, including IEEE 1588 standards. These devices may be based on quartz, quartz MEMS or advanced materials science designed to achieve higher performance levels than quartz. MtronPTI's products offer high reliability over a wide temperature range and are well-suited for harsh environments, including shock and vibration-resistant oscillators with low-g sensitivity. These products are designed for applications within aerospace and defense, avionics, telecommunications infrastructure and instrumentation markets.
 MtronPTI's Spectrum Control product group includes a wide array of radio frequency (“RF”), microwave and millimeter wave filters and diplexers covering a frequency range from 1 MHz to 30 GHz, and solid-state power amplifiers covering a frequency range from 300 MHz to 26 GHz, with power output from 10 Watts to 10kW. Filter devices include crystal, ceramic, LC, tubular, combline, cavity, interdigital and metal insert waveguide, as well as digital, analog and mechanical tunable filters, switched filter arrays and RF subsystems. Power amplifiers add active

devices to MtronPTI's portfolio and include GaN, GaAS FET, LDMOS and chip and wire technologies in narrow or broadband, module or rack-mounted packages. These products are employed in applications within the commercial and military aerospace, defense, avionics, space and other commercial markets.
 New product development continues to be a key focus for MtronPTI as it continues to push its roadmap to meet the needs of its served markets. Within Frequency Control, design efforts are focused on smaller packages, lower power, lower phase noise and use of new materials to provide compensation and harsh environment performance that surpasses customer requirements. Spectrum Control seeks to develop higher power handling and higher frequency along with higher levels of integration and a range of integrated products within the RF subsystem.
 Customers
 We primarily work directly with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to define the right solutions for their unique applications, including the design of custom parts with unique part numbers. Actual sales of production parts may be directly to the OEM or through either its designated contract manufacturers or franchised distributors of our products. As a result, we have highly skilled sales engineers who work directly with the designers and program managers at their OEMs providing a high-level of engineering support at all points within the process.
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our largest customer, a commercial aerospace and defense company, accounted for $8,190,000, or 25.7%, of the Company's total revenues, compared to $7,838,000, or 29.4%, of the Company’s total revenues For the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s second largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2022, a defense contractor, accounted for $4,857,000, or 15.3%, of the Company's total revenues, compared to $3,138,000, or 11.8%, of the Company’s total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss of either of these customers, or a decrease in their demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.
 As of December 31, 2022, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $2,872,000, or 53.8%, of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $2,568,000, or 62.3%, of accounts receivable. The insolvency of any of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. The Company carefully evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers in deciding to extend credit and utilizes letters of credit to further limit credit risk for export sales. As a result of these policies, the Company has experienced very low historical bad debt expense and believes the related risk to be minimal.
 Competition
 We design, manufacture and market products for the generation, synchronization and control of time and frequency as well as spectrum control products. There are numerous domestic and international manufacturers who are capable of providing custom-designed products comparable in quality and performance to our products. Our competitive strategy begins with our focus on niche markets where precise specification and reliability are the major requirements.
Research and Development
 Utilizing our understanding of market requirements, we employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation when selecting new product development projects. A cross-functional team comprised of engineering, marketing, operations, sales and finance reviews the merits of specific projects seeking to invest in products that will exceed a specific return on investment level and a payback expectation within one to two years. In addition, the team considers the inherent value of intellectual property that each project presents with consideration for technical roadmap objectives.
 Research and development expense was $2,006,000 for both 2022 and 2021, and will remain a significant part of the Company's efforts to continually revitalize its intellectual property position.
 Marketing and Sales
 We have a highly skilled team of sales engineers who work in tandem with a worldwide network of more than 30 independent external manufacturer representatives and franchised electronics distributors to market and sell our products. An important part of the sales process is gaining qualification of specific products from the OEM, confirming suitability for use in a specific system design, which is commonly referred to as a "design-win." Through direct contact with our clients and through our representative network, we are able to understand the needs of the marketplace and then guide our product development process to allocate resources to meeting those requirements.

Domestic Revenues
 Our domestic revenues were $22,439,000 in 2022, or 70.5% of total consolidated revenues, compared to $20,952,000, or 78.5% of total consolidated revenues, in 2021.
 International Revenues
 Our international revenues were $9,406,000 in 2022, or 29.5% of total consolidated revenues, compared to $5,742,000, or 21.5% of total consolidated revenues, in 2021. In each of 2022 and 2021, these revenues were derived mainly from customers in Asia, with significant sales in Malaysia. We avoid significant currency exchange risk by transacting and settling substantially all of our international sales in United States dollars.
Seasonality
 Our business is not seasonal, although shipment schedules may be affected by the production schedules of our customers, or their contract manufacturers based on regional practices or customs.
Order Backlog
 Our order backlog was $46,180,000 and $29,439,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The backlog of unfilled orders includes amounts based on signed contracts and purchase orders. Although backlog represents only firm orders that are considered likely to be fulfilled primarily within the 12 to 24 months following receipt of the order, cancellations or scope adjustments may and do occur.
 Order backlog is adjusted quarterly to reflect project cancellations, deferrals, revised project scope and cost. We expect to fill a substantial portion of our order backlog as of December 31, 2022 during 2023 and 2024, but cannot provide assurances as to what portion of the order backlog will be fulfilled in any given year.
 Raw Materials
 Generally, most raw materials used in the production of our products are available in adequate supply from a number of sources though the prices of these raw materials have recently increased as a result of inflation and supply chain issues. Some raw materials, including printed circuit boards, IC’s, quartz and certain metals including steel, aluminum, silver, gold, tantalum and palladium, are subject to greater supply fluctuations and price volatility, as experienced in recent years. In general, we have been able to include some cost increases in our pricing, but in some cases our margins were adversely impacted.
 Changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and the outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic have disrupted supply chains and the ability to obtain components and raw materials around the world for most companies, including us. On occasion, one or more of the components used in our products have become unavailable resulting in unanticipated redesign and/or delays in shipments. Continued identification of alternative supply sources or other mitigations are important in minimizing disruption to our supply chain.
 Intellectual Property
 We have no patents, trademarks or licenses that are considered to be significant to our business or operations. Rather, we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering and technical staff in areas of product design and manufacturing processes, including our staff’s ability to customize products to meet difficult specifications, as well as proprietary know-how and information.
Government Regulations
 As a supplier to certain U.S. Government defense contractors, we must comply with significant procurement regulations and other requirements. Maintaining registration under ITAR for all of our related production facilities is also required. One of those production facilities must comply with additional requirements for its production processes and for selected personnel in order to maintain the security of classified information. These requirements, although customary within these markets, increase our performance and compliance costs. 
 We are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency and Defense Contract Management Agency. These agencies review our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of our 
 4

internal control systems and policies. Any cost found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. 
 From time to time, we may also be subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our or our customers' operations and products and are expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws, including the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We or our customers may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, or result in a diminution in revenue from our customers, if we or our customers are found to have violated the law or are indicted or convicted for violations of federal laws related to government security regulations, employment practices or protection of the environment, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law. Such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from serving as a supplier to government contractors for some period of time. Such convictions or actions could have a material adverse effect on us and our operating results. The costs of cooperating or complying with such audits or investigations may also adversely impact our financial results.
 Our manufacturing operations, products, and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and other chemicals. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, both within the United States and internationally, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance that would be associated with such regulations. To date, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company have not been materially affected by compliance with current federal, state, and local laws and regulations (domestic and foreign) relating to the protection of the environment. However, we cannot predict the effect of future laws and regulations.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 326 people, including 161 full-time and 17 part-time employees, along with 148 contractors. Of this total, the Company has 150 full-time, 17 part-time, and 6 contract employees within the U.S., with 142 located in Orlando, Florida, and 31 in Yankton, South Dakota. The Company has three full-time employees in Hong Kong, and eight full-time employees and 142 contractors in Noida, India. None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union and the Company considers its relationships with employees to be good.
 As an engineered products and solutions company, a significant number of our workforce consists of degreed engineers providing expertise in product design and process development.
