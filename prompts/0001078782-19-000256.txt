Corporate History and Background
 
Mentor Capital, Inc. (“Mentor” or “the Company"), which reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in September 2015, was founded as an investment partnership in Silicon Valley, California by the current CEO in 1985. The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1994 as Main Street Athletic Clubs, Inc. and operated a small chain of athletic clubs, a trucking company, and food companies, among other things. In 1996 our registration under Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933 was declared effective. and we began to trade publicly. In 1997, the Company changed its name to Main Street AC, Inc. and merged with a group of approximately fifteen oil and gas partnerships which proved to be unsuccessful. In 1998 we entered a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the Northern District of California, due to a need to decrease oil and gas related debt in excess of asset value.
 
As we emerged from bankruptcy, the court allowed the original issuance of approximately $145 Million in warrants to the Company’s claimants and creditors. The warrants were in (4) four classes, have been reset to lower prices, and have been principally exercised at $0.09, $0.11, $0.65, $1.00, $1.60 and $7.00 per share. The outstanding Series D warrants are exercisable at $1.60 per share, at which price we may receive as much as $10 Million in warrant proceeds. The amount of proceeds received from exercised warrants may be limited by the general status of the economy and the price per share of our regular shares of Common Stock. Warrant holders are more likely to exercise warrants at $1.60 per warrant share if the shares of our Common Stock are priced above $1.60 per share. The longer the Company’s Common Stock share price is above $1.60, the more likely warrant holders will be willing to exercise their warrants. If the Common Stock share price is less than $1.60 for a long period of time, the Company may also decide to lower the exercise price of outstanding warrants to entice warrant holders to exercise their warrants and invest in the Company. The amount of potential funds received by the Company from such exercises will decrease as the warrant exercise price decreases. There are also 87,456 outstanding Series B warrants exercisable at $0.11.
 
On February 9, 2015, in accordance with Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the Company’s Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (“Plan of Reorganization”), the Company announced a minimum 30 day partial redemption of up to 1% of the already outstanding Series D warrants to provide for the court specified redemption mechanism for warrants not exercised timely by the original holder or their estates. Company designees that applied during the 30 days paid 10 cents per warrant to redeem the warrant and then exercised the Series D warrant to purchase a share of the Company’s Common Stock at the court specified formula of not more than one-half of the closing bid price on the day preceding the 30 day exercise period. In successive months, the authorized partial warrant redemption amount was recalculated, and the redemption offer repeated according to the court formula. In the Company’s October 7, 2016 press release, Mentor stated that the 1% redemptions which were formerly priced on a calendar month schedule would subsequently be initiated and priced on a random date schedule after the prior 1% redemption was completed to prevent potential third-party manipulation of share prices at month-end. The periodic partial redemptions could continue to be recalculated and repeated until such unexercised warrants are exhausted, or the partial redemption is otherwise truncated by the Company. In 2018, the Company allowed for a partial redemption of 63,161 Series D warrants at an exercise price of $0.35 plus a $0.10 warrant redemption fee per warrant and an additional 379,436 Series D Warrants were exercised at their full exercise price of $1.60 plus the $0.10 warrant redemption fee per warrant. In 2017, there was one partial redemption request accepted to exercise 100,000 outstanding Series D warrants for an exercise price of $0.90 plus the warrant redemption fee of $0.10 per warrant and an additional 1,540,382 Series D warrants were exercised at their full exercise price of $1.60 plus the $0.10 warrant redemption fee per warrant. Also, in 2017, 4,500 outstanding Series B warrants were exercised at an exercise price of $0.11 per warrant. The regular warrant exercises and 1% partial redemption exercises, which exercise price was recalculated and repeated according to the court formula, resulted in a combined average exercise price of $1.42 per share and $1.55 per share for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 
The Bankruptcy Court approved Plan of Reorganization allows all the warrants and shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants to trade freely under an exemption provided by Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. We received an SEC “No Comment” letter and our Plan of Reorganization was confirmed January 11, 2000. The SEC’s letter is not and should not be interpreted as approval of the Company’s Disclosure Statement or Plan of Reorganization.

In 2009 the Company began focusing its investing activities in leading-edge cancer companies. In early 2013 in response to government limitations on reimbursement for highly technical and expensive cancer treatments and a resulting business decline in the cancer immunotherapy sector, the Company decided to exit that space. In the summer of 2013, the Company was asked to consider investing in a cancer-related project with a medical marijuana focus. On August 29, 2013, the Company decided to divest of its cancer assets and focus future investments in the medical marijuana and cannabis sector. In March 2018, the Company sold its equity interest in our final remaining cancer investment.

MENTOR CAPITAL, INC.
 
Overview
 
Our goal is to focus future investments in the medical marijuana and social use cannabis sector. Currently, our general business operations are intended to provide management consultation and headquarters functions, especially with regard to accounting and audits, for our larger investment targets and our majority-owned subsidiaries. We monitor our smaller and less than majority positions for value and investment security. Management also spends considerable effort reviewing possible acquisition candidates within the cannabis industry on an ongoing basis. 
 
Mentor seeks to take significant positions in medical marijuana and cannabis companies to provide public market liquidity for founders, protection for investors, funding for the cannabis companies, and to incubate private cannabis companies that Mentor believes to have significant potential. When Mentor takes a significant position in its investees, it provides financial management when needed but leaves operating control in the hands of the cannabis company founders. Retaining control, receiving greater liquidity, and working with an experienced organization to efficiently develop disclosures and compliance are three potential key advantages to cannabis founders working with Mentor Capital, Inc.
 
Because adult social use and medical marijuana opportunities often overlap, Mentor Capital participates in the legal recreational marijuana market. However, Mentor’s preferred focus is medical, and the Company seeks to facilitate the application of cannabis to cancer wasting, Parkinson’s disease, calming seizures, reducing ocular pressures from glaucoma and blunting chronic pain.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company and subsidiaries had the following cannabis-related and non-cannabis investments in place. The Company’s aggregate investment in these companies currently totals $4,673,007: 
 

$194,028 investment in Electrum Capital Partners, LLC membership interests.

$200,000 investment in contractual interest in Electrum Capital Partners, LLC legal recovery. 

$67,697 legacy investment in Waste Consolidators, Inc. (“WCI”) (a 51% ownership which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements). WCI is a $3.6 Million revenue generating private service business based in Phoenix, AZ with services in Austin, TX also. WCI works with business park owners, governmental centers, and apartment complexes to reduce their facilities related costs.

$535,518 investment in an account receivable with annual payments of $117,000 that expires in or around January 2026 from a non-affiliated individual;

$1,111,460 finance leases receivable from G Farma

$1,016,826 convertible promissory notes receivable from G Farma.

$600,002 receivable from assigned interest in G Farma recovery in civil forfeiture or similar recoveries.

$425,821 finance leases receivable from Pueblo West.

$41,600 estimated fair value for 3.75% ownership in G Farma Equity Entities.

$76,801 invested in NeuCourt, Inc. including accrued interest under two convertible promissory notes receivable that bear interest at 5% per annum.

$25,000 investment through Mentor IP, LLC for potential rights on a patent application for THC vape systems.

$97,390 investment in NASDAQ listed company stock.

$265,195 investment in OTCQB listed company stock.

$5,669 investment in OTCQB listed company stock warrants.

The Company continually works to identify cannabis related acquisitions and investments. While evaluating whether an acquisition may be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, no transaction will be announced until that transaction is certain. 
 
Currently, there are 34 states, and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands, that have laws and/or regulation that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies cannabis as a schedule I controlled substance and makes marijuana use and possession illegal at the national level. In Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 125 S. Ct. 2195 (2005), the United States Supreme Court ruled that under the authority of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, it is the Federal Government that has the right to regulate cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. Thus, even in states where the use of cannabis has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.

Overview (Continued)
 
The Obama administration stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical and recreational cannabis. However the Trump administration has indicated that it will reconsider such policy and practice, especially with respect to recreational cannabis. Even if the Trump administration affirms the same approach with respect to medical or recreational cannabis, there is no guarantee that such policy and practice will not change regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws in states where cannabis has been legalized.
Competition
 
There are many companies that are interested in investing in the medical marijuana and cannabis industry, many of which are well-funded companies. Additionally, the operating companies in the cannabis sector are highly fragmented and compete against each other. Any acquisition by Mentor will be in competition with several other similar cannabis related operations in the sector. 
Employees
 
Mentor has 4 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee in its corporate office in Ramona, California. The corporate office employees also provide administrative support for MCIP, Partner I, and Partner II operations. WCI has 36 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee in Tempe, Arizona and 4 full-time employees in Austin, Texas.
