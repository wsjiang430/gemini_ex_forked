Item 1.         Business
General
 
Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. (“Tel”, “TIC” or the “Company”) has been in business since 1947, and is a leading designer and manufacturer of avionics test and measurement solutions for the global commercial air transport, general aviation, and government/military aerospace and defense markets.  The Company designs, manufactures and sells instruments to test and measure, and also calibrates and repairs a wide range of airborne navigation and communication equipment.
 
The Company’s strategy over the years has been to invest heavily in research and development to design products significantly better than its competition. Our products provide the stimulus and signals necessary for certification, verification, fault finding and diagnosis of airborne military and commercial navigation and communication systems. Our products incorporate high levels of integration by combining more test functions into a single unit, and thereby reducing customer acquisition, training, and life-cycle support costs than legacy systems. The Company offers avionic test sets for:
 

■ | Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transponders and interrogators. (95% of flight-line test market)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)
--+--------------------------------


■ | Commercial Air Traffic Control
--+-------------------------------


■ | Navigation
--+-----------


■ | Communication
--+--------------

 
Tel’s instruments are used to test navigation and communications equipment installed in aircraft, both on the flight line (“ramp testers”) and in the maintenance shop (“bench testers”), and range in list price from $10,000 to $90,000 per unit.  Tel continues to develop new products in anticipation of customers’ needs, and to maintain its strong market position.  Its development of multi-function testers has made it easier for customers to perform ramp tests with less operator training, a fewer number of test sets, and lower product support costs.
 
The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (“IFF”) flight line test equipment market, and these products will be very competitive in both the domestic and overseas markets. We believe that we are well-positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military and we have already delivered test sets into 18 international markets. The new T-47/M5 Mode 5 IFF test set will be a cost-effective upgrade option for our large installed base of Mode 4 test sets and we have shipped a growing number of units to various countries, and expect to receive additional orders for this product.  All allied countries have a drop-dead date of July 1, 2020 for Mode 5 capability so this international business has started to accelerate this year and we expect it to remain strong for at least the next three years. We will continue to actively market our products to all of the major international customers. Our expectation is that we will continue to improve both our revenues and gross margins.
 
The commercial avionics industry is undergoing a great deal of change and we believe our new lightweight, hand-held products that we are planning to introduce towards the end of calendar year 2019 will generate increased market share at very attractive gross margin levels. The technology for the hand-held product will provide a platform for future products. This new technology provides us with the opportunity to expand out of our relatively narrow avionics test market niche and enter the much larger secure communications radio test market. We are actively working to secure partners to enter this growth market and we believe that our new hardware platform provides unmatched capabilities in a market leading form factor. TIC is also evaluating upcoming customer test set requirements and expects at least one large competitive solicitation will be issued in the next 12 months for a product in our technical area of expertise. We are also working closely with our other military customers on new potential market opportunities that will be needed to maintain our sales and profitability growth.
 
We continue to evaluate other attractive potential market opportunities.

Communications/Navigation (“COMM/NAV) Radio Frequency (RF) Avionics Flight line Tester”) (“CRAFT”) (AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719)
 
The AN/USM-708 multi-purpose test set was developed by the Company in conjunction with the U.S. Navy. The AN/USM-708 large 6.0 inch color LCD screen and surrounding soft-keys and keyboard provides easy and quick access to a multiple of test screens menus, and display options affording single man operation, instant results, and a host of pre-programmed and manually variable parameters to meet the most demanding requirements for testing of airborne avionic and communication equipment.
 
The AN/USM-708 has been and continues to be a key product for the Company as it represents a new generation technology product. The Company delivered approximately $40 million in orders, representing over 1,200 test sets, for the AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 (IFF only) test sets from the U.S. Military. The AN/USM-708 CRAFT unit combines advanced IFF (including Mode 5 encryption technology) navigation, communication, and sonobuoy test capabilities in a portable test set, which will utilize a flexible and expandable digital-signal-processing-based architecture. Both the AN/USM-708 and the AN/USM-719 have been certified by the AIMS Program Office.
 
Based on entirely new up-to-date technology and digital architecture, the AN/USM-708 is a leap forward in precision testing of the following systems:
 

● | Transponder: Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, 4 Mode S, EHS (Enhanced Surveillance) and Mode 5
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interrogator: Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, 4, Mode S, Mode 5, TCAS & ETCAS, Shipboard Processor
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) TX & RX
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Navigation: VOR, ILS, LOC, GS, MB, TACAN
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Sonobuoy
--+---------


● | Link-4
--+-------


● | VSWR
--+-----

 
This program represented the culmination of a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment by the Company in Mode 5 technology and continues to provide a significant competitive advantage. Management believes that the CRAFT program also has potential for sales into the balance of the U.S. Military, NATO, and internationally, as the new Mode 5 IFF systems are installed in overseas aircraft platforms.
 
The contract for the AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 was a significant milestone for the Company because the development of this proprietary technology, which was funded by the Company, established Tel’s position as a leader in the industry. The CRAFT test set replaced seven obsolete U.S. Navy test sets that collectively cost approximately $300,000, making the CRAFT test set an excellent value to the government. This unit has been well-received by the end users. The core technology in the AN/USM-708 has been the foundation for additional military and commercial products.
 
We believe that the CRAFT test set also has potential for sales into the balance of the U.S. Military, NATO, and internationally, as the new Mode 5 IFF systems are installed in overseas aircraft platforms.
 
The Joint Strike Fighter (“JSF”) program is expected to generate significant CRAFT orders as this program ramps up limited rate production. The Company has already received orders from Lockheed Martin for the AN/USM-708 units, for the JSF Program, totaling approximately $6 million. Sikorsky has also indicated that it will be ordering CRAFT test sets for its new helicopters. The Company also receives orders from other customers for this product.

New Products
 
TIC continues to invest in new products and has invested significant dollars in its new lightweight hand-held design, the SDR/OMNI.
 
TS-4530i
 
This is a software/hardware upgrade of the TS-4530A that we will be selling internationally and potentially to our U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force customers. This test set includes added functionality, including manual Mode 5 test capability and TACAN test function. This unit also includes new battery technology that will substantially increase operating time. We are very optimistic about the prospects for this software upgrade for the international market. Penetrating the U.S. military market will entail securing customer buy-in and funding which can be an extended process. This upgraded unit will also require AIMS testing and approval.
 
The Company has also developed a Remote Client LabVIEW program for the CRAFT, TS-4530A, and T-47/M5 products and we have seen solid interest is this product. The Remote Client LabVIEW program will be used by TIC customers in both manufacturing and engineering environments. The software application allows for remote control of the unit with a print-out of all test results. It is expected that its primary application will be for Mode 5 and ADS-B certification testing. We believe that this product will be a source of recurring high margin profits in the years ahead. This software should also assist in the sale of Mode 5 test sets due to the added functionality provided.
 
SDR-OMNI
 
The Company is finalizing its new handheld avionics flight-line Test Set, the “SDR-OMNI”. The world’s first “All-in-One” Avionics Test Set utilizes true software-designed radio technology that enables it to test all common avionics functions in one 4.5 pound test set, which is half the weight of competitive test sets. The SDR/OMNI has very wide frequency to accommodate new commercial and military waveforms. It utilizes the latest touch screen technology and has the capability to replace all TIC commercial test sets with one handheld product. The initial SDR-OMNI software release will provide test capability for Transponders (Modes A, C, and S), ADS-B, and 978 MHz UAT capability for the large general aviation test market. This release is targeted at the civil aviation market that is subject to the January 1, 2020 requirement for ADS-B out test capability. This will allow us to compete with the IFR 4000 and 6000 test tests for our commercial aviation and military customers. The next software release will incorporate Nav/Comm test functions which can be purchased as APP’s by our customers. The SDR-Omni product is a game changer in the commercial avionics test market as it will allow customers to replace multiple competitive test sets with one unit that is smaller and provides more capabilities at a fraction of the cost. It has also been designed to allow TIC to penetrate the secure communications test market which is considerably larger than our core avionics test market. The much larger growth potential is in the secure military and homeland security radio test market which is many times the size of our existing avionics test market.
 
This new technology could provide us with the opportunity to expand out of our relatively narrow avionics test market niche and enter the much larger secure military and homeland security radio test market which is many times the size of our existing avionics test market. The secure military test set market is very large, and we are anticipating a large competitive DOD solicitation to take place in the next two years.We are currently in discussions with various companies about collaborating in these markets. We are actively working to line up partners to enter this growth market and we believe that our new hardware platform provides unmatched capabilities in a market leading form factor.
 
Future Prospects
 
The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 IFF and TACAN test set market. We believe that we are well positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military and we have already delivered test sets into 18 international markets. The commercial avionics industry is undergoing a great deal of change, and we believe our new hand-held products that we are planning to introduce in twelve months, will generate increased market share at very attractive gross margin levels. We are also working closely with our military customers on new potential market opportunities that will be needed to maintain our sales and profitability.

Item 1.       Business (continued)
 
General (continued)
 
Competition
 
The Company manufactures and sells commercial and military products as a single avionics business, and its designs and products cross both markets.
 
The general aviation market consists of some 1,000 avionics repair and maintenance service shops at private and commercial airports in the United States that purchase test equipment to assist in the repair of aircraft electronics. The commercial aviation market consists of approximately 80 domestic and foreign commercial airlines.
 
The civilian market for avionic test equipment is dominated by two designers and manufacturers, the Company and Aeroflex, Inc., a division of Viavi Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAV) (“Aeroflex”), with Aeroflex being substantially larger than Tel.  This market is relatively narrow and highly competitive.  Tel has been successful because of its high quality, new technology, user friendly products and competitive prices.  
 
The military market is large and is dominated by large corporations with substantially greater resources than the Company, including Aeroflex.  Tel competitively bids for government contracts on the basis of the engineering quality and innovation of its products, competitive price, and “small business set asides” (i.e., statutory provisions requiring the military to entertain bids only from statutorily defined small businesses), and on bids for sub-contracts from major government suppliers.  There are a limited number of competitors who are qualified to bid for “small business set asides.”  The military market consists of many independent purchasing agencies and offices. The process of awarding contracts is heavily regulated by the U.S. Department of Defense. 
 
Over the last fifteen years, the Company has won several large, competitively bid contracts from the military and has become the primary supplier for the U.S. Military, as well as the NATO countries, of flight line IFF test equipment. The CRAFT AN/USM-708, CRAFT AN/USM-719,TS-4530A, TS-4530i and TR-47/M5 test sets, discussed previously, involve a new generation of technology, including the next generation of IFF testing, and is expected to enable the Company to continue to be a major supplier of avionics test equipment to the military for years to come. Tel believes its new technology will also allow it to increase sales to the commercial avionics market in the future and expand into the very large secure communication test market.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Domestic commercial sales are made throughout the U.S. to commercial airlines and general aviation businesses directly or through distributors. No direct commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of commercial sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018.  The Company has one domestic distributor which receives discounts ranging between 16%-20% discount for stocking, selling, and, in some cases, providing product calibration and repairs. The loss of this distributor would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its operations. Commercial sales represented 24% and 26% of total sales, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Our commercial distributor represented approximately 24% and 38%, respectively, of commercial sales during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. This distributor also accounted for 6% and 10% of total sales for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Marketing to the U.S. Government is made directly by employees of the Company or through independent sales representatives, who receive similar commissions to the commercial distributors. For the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, sales to the U.S. Government, including shipments through the government’s logistics centers, represented approximately 39% and 23%, respectively, of total sales. No other government customer represented over 10% of government sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
 
International sales are made throughout the world to government and commercial customers, directly through American export agents, or through the Company’s overseas distributors at a discount reflecting a 15% to 22% selling commission, under written or oral, year-to-year arrangements. The Company has an exclusive distribution agreement with Muirhead Avionics and Accessories, Ltd (“Muirhead”), based in the United Kingdom, to represent the Company in parts of Europe, and with Milspec Services in Australia and New Zealand.  Tel also sells its products through exclusive distributors in Spain, Portugal, and the Far East and is exploring distribution in other areas.  For the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, total international sales were 20% and 26%, respectively, of sales, reflecting the Company’s growth into the international market. Additionally, the Company has an agreement with M.P.G. Instruments s.r.l., based in Italy, wherein this distributor has the exclusive sales rights for DME/P ramp and bench test units. The Company continues to explore additional marketing opportunities in other parts of the world, including the Far East. No international distributor accounted for more than 10% of total sales for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company has no material assets overseas.

Marketing and Distribution (continued)
 
Tel also provides customers with calibration and repair services. Repairs and calibrations accounted for 14% and 13% of sales for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Future domestic market growth, if any, will be affected in part by whether the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) implements additional plans to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system regulations and by continuing recent industry trends towards more sophisticated avionics systems, both of which would require the design and manufacture of new test equipment. The major development in the commercial marketplace is the ADS-B requirement for all aircraft after January 1, 2020.  TIC’s new products will address this testing requirement. Military contracts are awarded and implemented by extensive government regulation. The Company believes its test equipment is recognized by its customers for its quality, durability, reliability, affordability, and by its advanced technology.
 
Backlog
 
Set forth below is Tel’s avionics backlog at March 31, 2019 and 2018:
 

 | Commercial | | Government | | | Total
---------------+------------+---------+------------+---+-----------+------
March 31, 2019 | $ | 544,496 | | $ | 5,533,635 | | $ | 6,078,131
March 31, 2018 | $ | 403,779 | | $ | 1,592,629 | | $ | 1,996,408

 
Tel believes that most of its backlog at March 31, 2019 will be delivered during the next 12 months. The backlog is pursuant to purchase orders, and all of the government contracts are fully funded.  However, government contracts are always susceptible to termination for convenience by the government. The increase in the Company’s backlog reflects the increase in business. Historically, the Company obtains orders which are required to be filled in less than 12 months, and therefore, these anticipated orders are not reflected in the backlog.
 
Suppliers
 
Tel obtains its purchased parts from a number of suppliers.  These materials are standard in the industry, and the Company foresees no difficulty in obtaining purchased parts, as needed, at acceptable prices.
Patents and Environmental Laws
 
Tel has no patents or licenses which are material to its business, and there are no material costs incurred to comply with environmental laws.
 
Engineering, Research, and Development
 
In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, Tel spent $2,312,043 and $2,275,508, respectively, on the engineering, research, and development of new and improved products.  None of these amounts were sponsored by customers. Engineering, research, and development expenditures in fiscal year 2019 were made primarily for the development of the Company’s SDR/OMNI hand-held product line utilizing CRAFT and TS-4530A technology and the T47/M5 test set, the enhanced remote client, and the incorporation of other product enhancements in existing designs. The Company owns all of these designs with the exception of the AN/ARM-206 product.
