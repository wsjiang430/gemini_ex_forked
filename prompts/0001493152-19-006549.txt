Item 1. Business.
Overview and Background
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013, under the name Nuts & Bolts International, Inc. It was incorporated to engage in the business of publishing eBooks under the Nuts and Bolts brand name. Its business operations were conducted through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Nuts and Bolts Publishing, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company. From inception through February 29, 2016, the Company conducted limited operations including publishing two eBooks and one online “self-help” course on how to start a freelancing business.
 
On February 29, 2016, the Company had a change of control. On that date, Tan Sri Dato’ Sri Lai Teck Peng, a resident of Malaysia, acquired control of the Company through purchase of 5,000,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 77.67% of its issued and outstanding common stock. On the same date, the previous officers and directors of the Company resigned, and Mr. Lai was appointed as a Director and as CEO of the Company.
 
Following the change of control the Company elected to discontinue the eBook publishing operations previously carried on through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary.
 
Current Operations
 
Following the change of control, the Company intends to engage in the business of acting as an investment holding company and providing management and consulting services.
