ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Throughout this document Newmark Group, Inc. is referred to as “Newmark Knight Frank,” “Newmark,” and, together with its subsidiaries, as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our.” 
 Our Business 
 Newmark is a growing, full-service commercial real estate services business. We have been the fastest growing U.S. commercial real estate services firm (when compared with our publicly traded U.S. peers), with a revenue compound annual growth rate (which we refer to as “CAGR”) of 23.2% from 2016 to 2018.
 On November 30, 2018 (the “Distribution Date”), BGC completed its previously announced pro-rata distribution (the “Spin-Off”) to its stockholders of all of the shares of our common stock owned by BGC as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off.  Following the Spin-Off, BGC Partners ceased to be our controlling stockholder, and BGC Partners and its subsidiaries no longer held any shares of our common stock or other equity interests in us or our subsidiaries.  Following the Spin-Off, we are controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. (which we refer to as “Cantor”), a diversified company primarily specializing in financial and real estate services for institutional customers operating in the financial and commercial real estate markets.  Cantor is also the controlling stockholder of BGC. 
 We offer a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the needs of both real estate investors/owners and occupiers.  Our investor/owner services and products include capital markets, which consists of investment sales, debt and structured finance and loan sales, agency leasing, property management, valuation and advisory, commercial real estate due diligence consulting and advisory services and GSE lending and loan servicing, mortgage broking and equity-raising. Our occupier services and products include tenant representation, real estate management technology systems, workplace and occupancy strategy, global corporate consulting services, project management, lease administration and facilities management. We enhance these services and products through innovative real estate technology solutions and data analytics that enable our clients to increase their efficiency and profits by optimizing their real estate portfolio. We have relationships with many of the world’s largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenues of $2.0 billion representing year-over-year growth of 28%. 
 We believe that our high margins and leading revenue growth compared to the other publicly traded real estate services companies in the U.S. have resulted from the execution of our unique integrated corporate strategies: 
  
• | we offer a full suite of best-in-class real estate services and professionals to both investors/owners and occupiers,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we deploy deeply embedded technology and use data-driven analytics to enable clients to better manage their real estate utilization and spend, enhancing the depth of our client relationships,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we attract and retain market-leading professionals with the benefits of our unique partnership structure and high growth platform,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we actively encourage cross-selling among our diversified business lines, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we continuously build out additional products and capabilities to capitalize on our market knowledge and client relationships.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Newmark was founded in 1929 with an emphasis on New York-based investor and owner services such as tenant and agency leasing, developing a reputation for talented, knowledgeable and motivated brokers. BGC acquired Newmark in 2011, and since the acquisition Newmark has embarked on a rapid expansion throughout North America across all critical business lines in the real estate services and product sectors. We believe our rapid growth has been due to our management’s vision and direction along with a proven track record of attracting high-producing talent through accretive acquisitions and profitable hiring. 
 11

We have more than 5,200 employees, including more than 1,700 revenue-generating producers in 135 offices in 96 cities, with an additional 27 licensee locations in the U.S. We intend to continue to opportunistically expand into markets, including outside of North America, and products where we believe we can profitably execute our full service and integrated business model. 
 Bolstered by our acquisition of Berkeley Point (a leading commercial real estate finance company focused on the origination, sale and servicing of multifamily loans through government-sponsored and government-funded loan programs) in the third quarter of 2017, we believe we are poised for continued growth and value creation. According to a recent study commissioned by the National Multifamily Housing Council (“NMHC”) and the National Apartment Association, favorable demographics are anticipated to drive growth in multifamily sales and GSE lending, with demand for new apartments expected to reach 4.6 new million apartments by 2030. The NMHC estimates that 325,000 new units must be built annually through 2030 to meet new demand. We expect the combination of our multifamily investment sales and GSE lending business to create significant growth across our platform and serve as a powerful margin and earnings driver. 
 In summary, we generate revenues from commissions on leasing and capital markets transactions, technology user and consulting fees, valuation and advisory, property and facility management fees, and mortgage origination and loan servicing fees. Our revenues are widely diversified across service lines, geographic regions and clients, with our top 10 clients accounting for approximately 5.3% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest client accounted for less than 2.0% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis in 2018.
 Our History 
 Newmark is a growing, high-margin, full-service commercial real estate services business that has a long history and, since its acquisition by BGC in 2011, has developed a broad reach. We have grown organically and through acquisitions including the following in 2017 and 2018: 

• | acquisition of Berkeley Point, which focuses on origination, sale and servicing of multifamily and commercial mortgage loans, including loans with GSEs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquisition of the assets of Regency Capital Partners, a San Francisco-based real estate finance firm;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquisition of Spring11, a New York-based commercial real estate due diligence firm;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquisition of ten former offices of the Integra Realty Resources valuations network based in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Wilmington, DE, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston, Pittsburgh, Denver, and Los Angeles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquisition of Jackson Cooksey, a Dallas-based corporate tenant representation real estate agency; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquisition of RKF, a New York-based firm specializing in retail leasing, investment sales and consulting services

Real Estate Investor/Owner Services and Products 
 Capital Markets. We offer a broad range of real estate capital markets services, including investment sales and facilitating access to providers of capital. We provide access to a wide range of services, including asset sales, sale leasebacks, mortgage and entity-level financing, equity-raising, underwriting and due diligence. Through our mortgage bankers and brokers, we are able to offer multiple debt and equity alternatives to fund capital markets transactions through third party banks, insurance companies and other capital providers, as well as through our GSE lending platform. 
 Agency Leasing. We execute marketing and leasing programs on behalf of owners of real estate to secure tenants and negotiate leases. We understand the value of a creditworthy tenant to landlords and work to maximize the financing value of any leasing opportunity. As of December 31, 2018, we represented buildings that totaled nearly 400 million square feet of commercial real estate on behalf of owners in the U.S. 
 Valuation and Advisory. We operate a national valuation and advisory business, which has grown over the past two years from approximately 30 professionals to over 400 professionals. Our appraisal team executes projects of nearly every size and type, from single properties to large portfolios, existing and proposed facilities and mixed-use developments across the spectrum of asset values. Clients include banks, pension funds, insurance companies, developers, corporations, equity funds, REITs and institutional capital sources. These institutions utilize the advisory services we provide in their loan underwriting, construction financing, portfolio analytics, feasibility determination, acquisition structures, litigation support and financial reporting. 
 Property Management. We provide property management services on a contractual basis to owners and investors in office, industrial and retail properties. Property management services include building operations and maintenance, vendor and contract negotiation, project oversight and value engineering, labor relations, property inspection/quality control, property accounting and financial reporting, cash flow analysis, financial modeling, lease administration, due diligence and exit strategies. We have an opportunity to grow our property management contracts in connection with other high margin leasing or other capital markets contracts. These businesses also give us better insight into our clients’ overall real estate needs. 
Government Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”)

Lending and Loan Servicing.  On September 8, 2017, BGC Partners completed the acquisition of Berkeley Point, a leading commercial real estate finance company focused on the origination and sale of multifamily and other commercial real estate loans through government-sponsored and government-funded loan programs, as well as the servicing of loans originated by it and third parties, including our affiliates. As a result of the Berkeley Point transaction, we participate in loan origination, sale, and servicing programs operated by two GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also originate, sell and service loans under HUD’s FHA programs, and are an approved HUD MAP and HUD LEAN lender, as well as an approved Ginnie Mae issuer. 
 Origination for GSEs. We originate multifamily loans distributed through the GSE programs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as through HUD programs. Through HUD’s MAP and LEAN Programs, we provide construction and permanent loans to developers and owners of multifamily housing, affordable housing, senior housing and healthcare facilities. We are one of 25 approved lenders that participate in the Fannie Mae DUS program and one of 22 lenders approved as a Freddie Mac seller/servicer. As a low-risk intermediary, we originate loans guaranteed by government agencies or entities and pre-sell such loans prior to transaction closing. We have established a strong credit culture over decades of originating loans and remains committed to disciplined risk management from the initial underwriting stage through loan payoff. Fannie Mae ranked us as a top-five multifamily lender in 2018 and Freddie Mac ranked us as a top-seven multifamily lender in 2018 based on financing volume with the GSEs.  
 Servicing. In conjunction with our origination services, we sell the loans that we originate under GSE and FHA programs and retain the servicing of those loans. The servicing portfolio (which includes certain other non-agency loans) provides a stable, predictable recurring stream of revenue to us over the life of each loan. The typical multifamily loan that we originate and service under these programs is either fixed or variable rate, and includes significant prepayment penalties. These structural features generally offer prepayment protection and provide more stable, recurring fee income. Berkeley Point is a Fitch and S&P rated commercial loan primary and special servicer, as well as a Kroll rated commercial loan primary and MF special servicer. It has a team of over 60 professionals throughout various locations in the United States dedicated to primary and special servicing and asset management. These professionals focus on financial performance and risk management to anticipate potential property, borrower or market issues. Portfolio management conducted by these professionals is not only a risk management tool, but also leads to deeper relationships with borrowers, resulting in continued interaction with borrowers over the term of the loan, and potential additional financing opportunities. 
 We believe that the combination of our leading multifamily investment sales, mortgage brokerage, and agency lending businesses will provide substantial cross-selling opportunities. In particular, we expect revenues to increase as we begin to capture a greater portion of the financings on investment sales transactions, and as we cross-refer business. 
 Product Offerings 
  
• | Fannie Mae. As one of 25 lenders under the Fannie Mae DUS program, Berkeley Point is an approved a multifamily approved seller/servicer for conventional, affordable and seniors loans that satisfy Fannie Mae’s underwriting and other eligibility requirements. Fannie Mae has delegated to us responsibility for ensuring that the loans originated under the Fannie Mae DUS program satisfy the underwriting and other eligibility requirements established from time to time by Fannie Mae. In exchange for this delegation of authority, we share up to one-third of the losses that may result from a borrower’s default. Most of the Fannie Mae loans that we originate are sold, prior to loan funding, in the form of a Fannie Mae-insured security to third-party investors. We service all loans that we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Freddie Mac. Berkeley Point is one of 22 Freddie Mac multifamily approved seller/servicer for conventional, affordable and seniors loans that satisfy Freddie Mac’s underwriting and other eligibility requirements. Under the program, we submit the completed loan underwriting package to Freddie Mac and obtain Freddie Mac’s commitment to purchase the loan at a specified price after closing. Freddie Mac ultimately performs its own underwriting of loans that we sell to Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac may choose to hold, sell or, as it does in most cases, later securitize such loans. We do not have any material risk-sharing arrangements on loans sold to Freddie Mac under the program. We also generally service loans that we originate under this Freddie Mac program.

• | HUD/Ginnie Mae/FHA. As an approved HUD MAP and HUD LEAN lender and Ginnie Mae issuer, we provide construction and permanent loans to developers and owners of multifamily housing, affordable housing, senior housing and healthcare facilities. We submit a completed loan underwriting package to FHA and obtain FHA’s firm commitment to insure the loan. The loans are typically securitized into Ginnie Mae securities that are sold, prior to loan funding, to third-party investors. Ginnie Mae is a United States government corporation in HUD. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. In the event of a default on a HUD insured loan, HUD will reimburse approximately 99% of any losses of principal and interest on the loan and Ginnie Mae will reimburse the majority of remaining losses of principal and interest. The lender typically is obligated to continue to advance principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts on Ginnie Mae securities until the HUD mortgage insurance claim has been paid and the Ginnie Mae security is fully paid. We also generally service all loans that we originate under these programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Lending Transaction Process.    Our value driven, credit focused approach to underwriting and credit processes provides for clearly defined roles for senior management and carefully designed checks and balances to ensure appropriate quality control. We are subject to both our own and the GSEs’ and HUD’s rigorous underwriting requirements related to property, borrower, and market due diligence to identify risks associated with each loan and to ensure credit quality, satisfactory risk assessment and appropriate risk diversification for our portfolio. We believe that thorough underwriting is essential to generating and sustaining attractive risk adjusted returns for our investors. 
 We source lending opportunities by leveraging a deep network of direct borrower and broker relationships in the real estate industry from our national origination platform. We benefit from offices located throughout the United States and our approximately $60 billion servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (of which approximately 5% relates to special servicing), providing real time information on market performance and comparable data points. 
 Financing. We finance our loan originations under GSE programs through collateralized financing agreements in the form of warehouse loan agreements (“WHAs”) with three lenders and an aggregate commitment as of December 31, 2018 of $1,650 million of which $700 million represented a temporary increase that expired on January 29, 2019 and an uncommitted $325 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. On January 29, 2019, the temporary increase was decreased by $400 million for the period from January 29, 2019 to April 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had collateralized financing outstanding of approximately $972 million and $360 million, respectively. Collateral includes the underlying originated loans and related collateral, the commitment to purchase the loans as well as credit enhancements from the applicable GSE or HUD. We typically complete the distribution of the loans we originate within 30 to 60 days of closing. Proceeds from the distribution are applied to reduce borrowings under the WHAs, thus restoring borrowing capacity for further loan originations under GSE programs.
 Intercompany Referrals. We, Cantor Commercial Real Estate Company, L.P. (“CCRE”) and certain of our affiliates have entered into arrangements in respect of intercompany referrals. Pursuant to these arrangements, the respective parties refer to each other, for customary fees, opportunities for commercial real estate loan originations to CCRE, opportunities for real estate investment sales, broker or leasing services to us and opportunities for government-sponsored loan originations (to Berkeley Point, which is part of our business). 
 Due Diligence and Underwriting. We provide commercial real estate due diligence consulting and advisory services to a variety of clients, including lenders, investment banks and investors. Our core competencies include underwriting, modeling, structuring, due diligence and asset management. We also offer clients cost-effective and flexible staffing solutions through both on-site and off-site teams. We believe that this business line gives us another way to cross-sell services to our clients. 
Real Estate Occupier Services and Products 
 Tenant Representation Leasing. We represent commercial tenants in all aspects of the leasing process, including space acquisition and disposition, strategic planning, site selection, financial and market analysis, economic incentives analysis, lease negotiations, lease auditing and project management. We assist clients by defining space requirements, identifying suitable alternatives, recommending appropriate occupancy solutions, negotiating lease and ownership terms with landlords and reducing real estate costs for clients through analyzing, structuring and negotiating business and economic incentives. Fees are generally earned when a lease is signed. In 
 15

many cases, landlords are responsible for paying the fees. We use innovative technology and data to provide tenants with an advantage in negotiating leases, which has contributed to our market share gains.
Workplace and Occupancy Strategy. We provide services to help organizations understand their current workplace standards and develop plans and policies to optimize their real estate footprint. We offer a multi-faceted consulting service underpinned by robust data and technology. 
 Global Corporate Services (“GCS”) and Consulting. GCS is our consulting and services business that focuses on reducing occupancy expense and improving efficiency for corporate real estate occupiers, with large, often multi-national presence. We provide beginning-to-end corporate real estate solutions for clients. GCS makes its clients more profitable by optimizing real estate usage, reducing overall corporate footprint, and improving work flow and human capital efficiency through large scale data analysis and our industry-leading technology. We offer global enterprise optimization, asset strategy, transaction services, information management, an operational technology product and transactional and operational consulting. Our consultants provide expertise in financial integration, portfolio strategy, location strategy and optimization, workplace strategies, workflow and business process improvement, merger and acquisition integration, and industrial consulting. We utilize a variety of advanced technology tools to facilitate the provision of transaction and management services to our clients. For example, our innovative VISION™ tool provides data integration, analysis and reporting, as well as the capability to analyze potential “what if” scenarios to support client decision making. VISION™ is a scalable and modular enterprise solution that serves as an integrated database and process flow tool supporting the commercial real estate cycle. Our VISION™ tool combines the best analytical tools available and allows the client to realize a highly accelerated implementation timeline at a reduced cost. We believe that we have achieved more than $3 billion in savings for our clients to date. 
 We provide real estate strategic consulting and systems integration services to our global clients including many Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies, owner-occupiers, government agencies, healthcare and higher education clients. We also provide enterprise asset management information consulting and technology solutions which can yield hundreds of millions of dollars in cost-savings for our GCS business’s client base on an annual basis. The relationships developed through the software implementation at corporate clients lead to many opportunities for us to deliver additional services. We also provide consulting services through our GCS business. These services include operations consulting related to financial integration, portfolio strategy, location strategy and optimization, workplace strategies, workflow and business process improvement, merger and acquisition integration and industrial consulting. Fees for these services are on a negotiated basis and are often part of a multi-year services agreement. Fees may be contingent on meeting certain financial or savings objectives with incentives for exceeding agreed upon targets. 
 Technology. GCS has upgraded and improved upon various technologies offered in the Real Estate field combining our technological specialties and our creative core of development within our GCS platform. We believe this technology to be a differentiator in the market and is in the first phase of our plan of continued innovations. This technology is currently being offered, and rolled out, to some of the world’s largest corporations. Delivering best-in-class technology solutions to occupiers of real estate will allow us an opportunity to add value to our clients and allow us to realize additional revenue growth through other GCS services such as lease administration, facilities management and tenant representation, as well as capital markets transactions for owner-occupiers of real estate. 
 Recurring Revenue Streams. GCS often provides a recurring revenue stream when it enters into multi-year contracts that provide repeatable transaction work, as opposed to one-off engagements in specific markets and other recurring fees for ongoing services, such as facilities management and leases administered over the course of the contract. Today’s clients are focused on corporate governance, consistency in service delivery, centralization of the real estate function and procurement. Clients are also less focused on transaction- based outcomes and more focused on overall results, savings, efficiencies and optimization of their overall business objectives. GCS was specifically designed to meet these objectives. We believe that GCS is hired to solve business problems, not “real estate” problems. 
 GCS provides a unique lens into the corporate real estate (which we refer to as “CRE”) outsourcing industry and offers a unique way to win business. Whether a client currently manages its corporate real estate function in-house (insource) or has engaged an external provider (outsource), GCS drives value by securing accounts that are first generation outsource or by gaining outsourced market share. 
 16

GCS increases value for the overall organization via multiple channels: 
  
• | Multiplying “transactionable” revenue for the firm across all locations in a client’s total real estate portfolio (i.e., involvement in transactions for hundreds to thousands of assets versus one transaction for a single asset).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging our position as a trusted advisor to route business to other non-related divisions of overall organization (e.g., capital markets).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amplifying business generation via large corporate procurement-driven efforts that involve harnessing the enterprise-wide spend for business-to-business / reciprocal business opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (“IAOP”) has named Newmark to The Best of The Global Outsourcing 100®, which identifies the world’s best outsourcing providers across all industries over the past 10 years. As part of this honor, IAOP cites “best of leaders,” “top customer references,” and “multiple appearances” as significant award category achievements for the Company. 
 In addition to the direct value that GCS creates for its clients, for our overall organization and for our brand within the industry, there is inherent value in GCS as a driver of innovation and thought leadership. GCS is comprised of subject matter experts and CRE leaders, and we generate strategic value by speaking at and hosting industry-related panels at CoreNet Global as well as the World Economic Forum and by publishing content to market. Also, the implementation of our Certified Advisor Program and internal GCS summits feature workshops, sessions and other activities designed to share key information, lessons learned and share best practices, all with the goal of improving service across all accounts. 
 Project Management. We provide a variety of services to tenants and owners of self-occupied spaces. These include conversion management, move management, construction management and strategic occupancy planning services. These services may be provided in connection with a discrete tenant representation lease or on a contractual basis across a corporate client’s portfolio. Fees are generally determined on a negotiated basis and earned when the project is complete. 
 Real Estate and Lease Administration. We manage leases for our clients for a fee, which is generally on a per lease basis. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 20,000 leases under management. We also perform lease audits and certain accounting functions related to the leases. Our lease administration services include critical date management, rent processing and rent payments. These services provide additional insight into a client’s real estate portfolio, which allows us to deliver significant value back to the client through provision of additional services, such as tenant representation, project management and consulting assignments, to minimize leasing and occupancy costs. For large occupier clients, our real estate technology enables them to access and manage their complete portfolio of real estate assets. We offer clients a fully integrated user-focused technology product designed to help them efficiently manage their real estate costs and assets. 
 Facilities Management. We manage a broad range of properties on behalf of users of commercial real estate, including headquarters, facilities and office space, for a broad cross section of companies, including Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. We manage the day-to-day operations and maintenance for urban and suburban commercial properties of most types, including office, industrial, data centers, healthcare, retail, call centers, urban towers, suburban campuses, and landmark buildings. Facilities management services may also include facility audits and reviews, energy management services, janitorial services, mechanical services, bill payment, maintenance, project management, and moving management. While facility management contracts are typically three to five years in duration, they may be terminated on relatively short notice periods.

Industry Trends and Opportunity 
 We expect the following industry and macroeconomic trends to impact our market opportunity: 
 Large and Highly Fragmented Market. The commercial real estate services industry is a more than $220 billion global revenue market opportunity of which we believe a significant portion currently resides with smaller and regional companies. Less than 15% of the revenue in the commercial real estate market is currently serviced by the top six global firms (by revenue), leaving a large opportunity for us to reach clients serviced by the large number of fragmented smaller and regional companies. We believe that clients increasingly value full service real estate service providers with comprehensive capabilities and multi-jurisdictional reach. We believe this will provide a competitive advantage for us as we have full service capabilities to service both real estate owners and occupiers. 
 Trend Toward Outsourcing of Commercial Real Estate Services. Outsourcing of real estate-related services has reduced both property owner and tenant costs, which has spurred additional demand for real estate. We believe that the more than $220 billion global revenue opportunity includes a large percentage of companies and landlords that have not yet outsourced their commercial real estate functions, including many functions offered by our management services businesses. Large corporations are focused on consistency in service delivery and centralization of the real estate function and procurement to maximize cost savings and efficiencies in their real estate portfolios. This focus tends to lead them to choose full-service providers like Newmark, where customers can centralize service delivery and maximize cost reductions. Our GCS business was specifically designed to meet these objectives through the development of high value-add client-embedded technology, expert consultants and transaction execution. For those companies and landlords who do not outsource, we consult with them and implement software to facilitate self-management more efficiently. This technology produces licensing and consulting revenues, allows us to engage further with these clients and positions us for opportunities to provide transaction and management services to fulfill their needs. 
 Increasing Institutional Investor Demand in Commercial Real Estate. Institutions investing in real estate often compare their returns on investments in real estate to the underlying interest rates in order to allocate their investments. The continued low interest rate environment around the world and appealing spreads have attracted significant additional investment by the portfolios of sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, pension and mutual funds, and other institutional investors, leading to an increased percentage of direct and indirect ownership of real-estate related assets over time. The target allocation to real estate by all institutional investors globally has increased from 3.7% of their overall portfolios in 1990 to over 10% in 2018, according to figures from Preqin Real Estate Online, Cornell University’s Baker Program in Real Estate and Hodes Weill & Associates. We expect this positive allocation trend to continue to benefit our capital markets, services, and GSE lending businesses. 
 Significant Levels of Commercial Mortgage Debt Outstanding and Upcoming Maturities. With $3.4 trillion in U.S. mortgage debt outstanding and with approximately $2.0 trillion of maturities expected from 2019 to 2023 according to Trepp, LLC and the MBA, we see opportunities in our commercial mortgage brokerage businesses and our GSE lending units. Sustained low interest rates typically stimulate our capital markets business, where demand is often dependent on attractive all-in borrowing rates versus asset yields. Demand also depends on credit accessibility and general macroeconomic trends. 
 Favorable Multifamily Demographics Driving Growth in GSE Lending and Multifamily Sales. Delayed marriages, an aging population and immigration to the United States are among the factors increasing demand for new apartment living, which, according to a recent study commissioned by the National Multifamily Housing Council (which we refer to as the “NMHC”) and the National Apartment Association (which we refer to as the “NAA”), is expected to reach 4.6 million new apartments by 2030. The NMHC estimates that 325,000 new apartments must be built annually through 2030 to meet new demand. Additionally, according to the MBA, multifamily loan originations by all lenders are estimated to have increased to $526 billion in 2018, CAGR of 3.5% from 2016 to 2018, while GSE originations were estimated to have increased by a 17.7% CAGR over the same period. We expect these trends will support continued growth for our multifamily capital markets business, which provides integrated investment sales, mortgage brokerage, GSE lending, and loan servicing capabilities.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from competitors and will help us enhance our position as a leading commercial real estate services provider: 
 Full Service Capabilities. We provide a fully integrated real estate services platform to meet the needs of our clients and seek to provide beginning-to-end corporate services to each client. These services include leasing, investment sales, mortgage brokerage, property management, facility management, multifamily GSE lending, loan servicing, advisory and consulting, appraisal, property and development services and embedded technological solutions to support their activities and allow them to comprehensively manage their real estate assets. Through our investment in Real Estate LP, we are able to provide clients access to nonagency lending investment management and other real-estate related offerings. Today’s clients are focused on consistency of service delivery, centralization of the real estate function and procurement, resulting in savings and efficiencies by allowing them to focus on their core competencies. Our target clients increasingly award business to full-service commercial real estate services firms, a trend which benefits our business over a number of our competitors. Additionally, our full service capabilities afford us an advantage when competing for business from clients who are outsourcing real estate services for the first time, as well as clients seeking best in class technology solutions. We believe that our comprehensive, top-down approach to commercial real estate services has allowed our revenue sources to become well-diversified across services and into key markets throughout North America. 
 Growing our Business with a Proven Ability to Attract Talent. Our business is continuing to rapidly grow and we believe we have an exceptional ability to identify, acquire or hire, and integrate high-performing companies and individuals. From December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2018, we have grown our revenues by 51.8%, and our average revenue per producer by 27.8%.  This growth is underpinned by our ability to attract and retain top talent in the industry. Many high-performing professionals are attracted to our technology capabilities, entrepreneurial culture, emphasis on cross-selling and unique partnership structure. This unique partnership structure allows acquirees the ability to contribute the value of their business to, and receive earnings from, our partnership. 
 Deeply Embedded, Industry-Leading Technology. Our advanced technology differentiates us in the marketplace by harnessing the scale and scope of our data derived from billions of square feet of leased real estate. Our technology platform is led by our innovative VISION™ product. This software combines powerful business intelligence, reporting and analytics, allowing clients to more efficiently manage their real estate portfolios. In addition to generating revenue from software licenses and user agreements, we believe our technology solutions encourage customers to use Newmark to execute capital markets and leasing transactions, as well as other recurring services. Our N360 custom mobile tools provide access to our research, demographics and notifications about various property related events. This allows us to facilitate more timely dissemination of critical real estate information to our clients and professionals spread throughout a diverse array of markets. To maintain our competitive advantage in the marketplace, we employ dedicated, in-house technology professionals and consultants who continue to improve existing software products as well as develop new innovations. We will continue to aggressively develop and invest in technology with innovations in this area, which we believe will drive the future of real estate corporate outsourcing. 
 Strong and Diversified Client Relationships. We have long-standing relationships with many of the world’s largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. We are able to provide beginning-to-end corporate services solutions for our clients through GCS. This allows us to generate more recurring and predictable revenues as we generally have multi-year contracts to provide services, including repeatable transaction work, lease administration, project management, facilities management and consulting. In capital markets, we provide real estate investors and owners with property management and agency leasing during their ownership and assist them with maximizing their return on real estate investments through investment sales, debt and equity financing, lending and valuation and advisory services and real estate technology solutions. We believe that the many touch points we have with our clients gives us a competitive advantage in terms of client-specific and overall industry knowledge, while also giving us an opportunity to cross-sell our various offerings to provide maximum value to our customers. 
 Strong Financial Position to Support High Growth. We generate significant earnings and strong and consistent cash flow that we expect to fuel our future growth. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018, 
 19

we generated revenues of $2.0 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 28%.  We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and our separation from BGC Partners will provide us with a “pure play” and more effective acquisition currency through our listed equity securities that will allow us to continue to grow our market share as we accretively acquire companies, develop and invest in technology and add top talent across our platform. Further, we believe that our capital position will be strengthened by our expected receipt of up to 8.9 million shares of common stock of Nasdaq, Inc. (which we refer to as “Nasdaq”) to be paid ratably over approximately 9 years in connection with the eSpeed sale (See “Item 7— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Nasdaq Monetization Transactions.”). In 2018, we entered into monetization transactions with respect to the Nasdaq shares for the shares to be received in each of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Based on the closing share price of Nasdaq as of December 31, 2018, the Nasdaq shares to be received from 2023 through 2027 are expected to generate approximately $400 million of proceeds.  See “Item 7— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Nasdaq Monetization Transactions.”  With our strong balance sheet and standalone equity currency, we believe we are well positioned to make future hires and acquisitions and to profitably grow our market share. 
 Partnership Structure Yields Multiple Benefits. We believe that our unique partnership structure provides us with numerous competitive advantages. Unlike many of our peers, virtually all of our key executives and revenue-generating employees have equity stakes. We believe this aligns our employees and management with shareholders and encourages a collaborative culture that drives cross-selling and improves revenue growth. Additionally, our partnership structure reduces recruitment costs by encouraging retention, as equity stakes are subject to redemption or forfeiture in the event that employees leave the firm to compete with Newmark. Additionally, our partnership structure is tax efficient for employees and our public shareholders. We believe that this structure, which will be enhanced by our standalone equity currency, promotes an entrepreneurial culture that, along with our strong platform, enables us to attract key producers in key markets and services. 
 Strong and Experienced Management Team. We have dozens of executives and senior managers who have significant experience with building and growing industry-leading businesses and creating significant value for stakeholders. Management is heavily invested in Newmark’s success, supporting strong alignment with shareholders. We believe our deep bench of talent will allow us to significantly increase the scale of Newmark as we continue to invest in our platforms. Our Chairman, Howard Lutnick, has more than 35 years of financial industry experience at BGC Partners and Cantor. He was instrumental in the founding of eSpeed in 1996, its initial public offering in 1999, and its merger with and into BGC Partners in 2008. In 2013, he negotiated the sale of eSpeed, which generated just under $100 million in annual revenues, to Nasdaq for over $1.2 billion. See “Item 7— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Nasdaq Monetization Transactions.”   Barry Gosin has served as Chief Executive Officer of Newmark since 1979 and has successfully guided the Company’s significant expansion since 2011. Mr. Gosin spearheaded our merger with BGC Partners in 2011 and has received the Real Estate Board of New York’s “Most Ingenious Deal of the Year” award on three separate occasions. In addition, Michael Rispoli, our Chief Financial Officer, and Stephen M. Merkel, our Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, along with our other senior management, collectively have decades of experience in the financial and real estate services industries. 
Our Differentiated Business Growth Strategy 
 Set forth below are the key components of our differentiated business growth strategy: 
 Profitably Hire Top Talent and Accretively Acquire Complementary Businesses. Building on our management team’s proven track record, our unique partnership structure, our high-growth platform and our standalone equity currency, we intend to opportunistically hire additional producers and acquire other firms, services and products to strengthen and enhance our broad suite of offerings. We expect this growth to deepen our presence in our existing markets and expand our ability to service existing and new clients. 
 20

Incentivize and Retain Top Talent Using Our Partnership Structure. Unlike many of our peers, virtually all of our key executives and producers have partnership or equity stakes in our company and receive deferred equity or Newmark Holdings units as part of their compensation.  Prior to the Spin-Off, they also received deferred equity from BGC or BGC Holdings units as part of their compensation. A significant percentage of Newmark’s fully diluted shares are owned by our executives, partners and employees. Our unique partnership structure, and our standalone equity currency, will enable us to motivate and retain our best producers more effectively than our peers in the key markets and services that are critical to our growth. Our ownership stakes, retention tools and partnership structure, together with the creation of Newmark equity solely linked to our business, will more strongly align our employee interests with those of our stockholders, and provide effective tools to recruit, motivate and retain our key employees. 
 Actively Cross-Sell Services to Increase Revenue and Expand Margins. We expect the combination of our services and products to generate substantial revenue synergies across our platforms, increase revenues per producer and expand margins. To complement and drive future growth opportunities within our GCS business, we are leveraging our capabilities in providing innovative front-end real estate technology solutions to complement and cross-sell other corporate services to those clients, including leasing services, project management, facilities management and lease administration services. Furthermore, the combination of our leading multifamily debt origination provider with our top-two multifamily investment sales business, and Newmark’s fast growing commercial mortgage business is an opportunity for strong loan originations and cross-selling opportunities across the multifamily market. 
 Utilize Our Technology to Provide Value and Deepen Relationships with Clients. We believe owners and occupiers of commercial real estate are increasingly focused on improving their efficiency, cost reduction and outsourcing of non-core real estate competencies. Through the use of our innovative technology and consulting services, we help clients become more efficient in their commercial real estate activities, and thus realize additional profit. We will continue to provide technology solutions for companies that self-manage, offering them visibility into their real estate data and tools to better manage their real estate utilization and spend. For instance, we are well positioned to provide technology services for the approximately 80% of the market (measured in square feet) that we believe does not outsource their real estate functions. The deep insight into our clients that we gain through our data and technology will provide us with opportunities to cross-sell consulting and transaction services. 
 Maximize Recurring and Other Revenue Opportunity from Each Service Offering to Real Estate Owners. We drive growth throughout the life cycle of each commercial real estate asset by providing best-in-class investment sales, debt and equity financing, agency leasing and property management. Our product offerings often create recurring revenues from properties, in particular with respect to property management, where the average life of our properties under management exceeds five years, and our servicing portfolio of approximately $60 billion (of which approximately 5% relates to special servicing). As of December 31, 2018, our primary servicing portfolio had an average life of eight years. Our multifamily investment sales business and our commercial mortgage brokerage business also drive revenue, through referrals, to our GSE lending business. We have also meaningfully expanded our valuation and advisory business, which we expect to spur significant growth and complement our platforms supporting the buying and selling of commercial real estate. 
 Opportunity to Grow Global Footprint. In 2018, less than 2% of our revenues were from international sources, while our largest, full-service, U.S.-listed competitors earned approximately 30-44% or more of their revenues outside the Americas, for the most recent twelve-month periods reported, excluding investment management. We believe that our successful history of acquiring businesses across the U.S. and making profitable hires across our business lines demonstrates our ability to increase revenues in North America and grow substantially through acquisitions and hiring globally. Currently, we facilitate servicing our clients’ needs outside of the Americas through our alliance with London-based Knight Frank LLP (which we refer to as “Knight Frank”). 
Nasdaq Transaction and Nasdaq Monetizations 
 On June 28, 2013, BGC Partners sold eSpeed to Nasdaq in the Nasdaq Transaction. The total consideration paid or payable by Nasdaq included an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of common stock of Nasdaq to be paid ratably over 15 years after the closing of the Nasdaq Transaction, provided that Nasdaq produces at least $25 million in gross revenues for the applicable year. Nasdaq generated gross revenues of approximately $4.3 billion in 2018. The right to receive the remainder of the Nasdaq payment was transferred from BGC Partners to us beginning in the third quarter of 2017. We have recorded gains related to the Nasdaq payments of $76 million in 2017 and $87 
 21

million in 2018 and expect our future results to include the additional approximately 8.9 million Nasdaq shares to be received over time.  In 2018, we entered into monetization transactions with respect to the Nasdaq shares for the shares to be received in each of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.  See “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Nasdaq Monetization Transactions.” 
 Our Knight Frank Partnership 
 We offer services to clients on a global basis. In 2005, we partnered with London-based Knight Frank in order to enhance our ability to provide best-in-class local service to our clients, throughout the world. Knight Frank, operates out of over 500 offices across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Africa. Outside of the Americas, we collaborate with Knight Frank to ensure that our clients have access to local expertise and to highly-skilled professionals in the locales where they choose to transact. We expect that our cross-selling efforts with Knight Frank will lead to continued growth, particularly as our growing capital markets business increases its penetration with foreign investors. 
 While we have the right to expand our international operations, we may be subject to certain short-term contractual restrictions due to our existing agreement with Knight Frank, which, was extended, effective on December 28, 2017 for a three-year period with a 90-day mutual termination right. The agreement restricts the parties from operating a competing commercial real estate business in the other party’s areas of responsibility. Our areas of responsibility are North America and South America. Knight Frank’s areas of responsibility are the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
 Our Domestic and Latin American Real Estate Services Alliances 
 In certain smaller markets in the United States and in countries in Latin America in which we do not maintain owned offices, we have agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain independently-owned offices in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenue from these relationships. These independently owned offices generally use some variation of our branding in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently-owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where our business does not have a physical presence. 
 22

Industry Recognition  
 As a result of our experienced management team’s ability to skillfully grow the Company, we have become a nationally recognized brand. Over the past several years, we have consistently won a number of U.S. industry awards and accolades, been ranked highly by third-party sources and significantly increased our rankings, which we believe reflects recognition of our performance and achievements. For example:

Clients 
 Our clients include a full range of real estate owners, occupiers, tenants, investors, lenders and multi-national corporations in numerous markets, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, student housing, hotels, data center, healthcare, self-storage, land, condominium conversions, subdivisions and special use. Our clients vary greatly in size and complexity, and include for-profit and non-profit entities, governmental entities and public and private companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top 10 clients, collectively, accounted for approximately 5.3% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest client accounted for less than 2.0% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We seek to develop our brand and to highlight its expansive platform while reinforcing our position as a leading commercial real estate services firm in the United States through national brand and corporate marketing, local marketing of specific product lines and targeted broker marketing efforts. 
National Brand and Corporate Marketing 
 At a national level, we utilize media relations, industry sponsorships and sales collateral and targeted advertising in trade and business publications to develop and market our brand. We believe that our emphasis on our unique capabilities enables us to demonstrate our strengths and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our multi-market business groups provide customized collateral, website and technology solutions designed to address specific client needs. 
 23

Local Product Line Marketing and Targeted Broker Efforts 
 On a local level, our offices (including those owned by us and independently owned offices) have access to tools and templates that provide our sales professionals with the market knowledge we believe is necessary to educate and advise clients, and also to bring properties to market quickly and effectively. These tools and templates include proprietary research and analyses, web-based marketing systems and ongoing communications and training about our depth and breadth of services. Our sales professionals use these local and national resources to participate directly in selling to, advising and servicing clients. We provide marketing services and materials to certain independently owned offices as part of an overall agreement allowing them to use our branding. We also benefit from shared referrals and materials from local offices. 
 Additionally, we invest in and rely on comprehensive research to support and guide the development of real estate and investment strategy for our clients. Research plays a key role in keeping colleagues throughout the organization attuned to important trends and changing conditions in world markets. We disseminate this information internally and externally directly to prospective clients and the marketplace through the company website. We believe that our investments in research and technology are critical to establishing our brand as a thought leader and expert in real estate-related matters and provide a key sales and marketing differentiator. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We hold various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We own numerous domain names and have registered numerous trademarks and/or service marks in the United States and foreign countries. We have a number of pending patent applications relating to the product of our thought leadership. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. Although we believe our intellectual property rights play a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights. Our trademark registrations must be renewed periodically, and, in most jurisdictions, every 10 years. 
Competition 
 We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, owner-occupier, property and agency leasing, property sales, valuation, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, GSE lending and loan servicing and development services. Each business discipline is highly competitive on a local, regional, national and global level. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we compete with other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our real estate management services business and have recently expanded their offerings. These competitors include companies such as Aramark, ISS A/S and ABM Industries. We also compete with in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms in various parts of our business. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than us, some of these competitors are more entrenched than us on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., Cushman & Wakefield plc, Savills Studley, Inc., and Colliers International Group, Inc. In addition, more specialized firms like HFF, Inc., Marcus & Millichap Inc., Eastdil Secured LLC (part of Wells Fargo & Company) and Walker & Dunlop, Inc. compete with us in certain service lines. 
 Seasonality 
 Due to the strong desire of many market participants to close real estate transactions prior to the end of a calendar year, our business exhibits certain seasonality, with our revenue tending to be lowest in the first quarter and strongest in the fourth quarter. For the full year ended 2018, we earned 21% of our revenues in the first quarter and 31% of our revenues in the fourth quarter, while the comparable figures were 21% and 29%, respectively, in 2017. 
 24

Partnership Overview 
 We believe that our partnership structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. We expect many of our key brokers, salespeople and other professionals to have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. We control the general partner of Newmark Holdings. The limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings consist of: (i) a special voting limited partnership interest held by us; (ii) exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor; (iii) founding/working partner interests held by founding/working partners; (iv) limited partnership units, which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs; and (v) Preferred Units, which are working partner interests that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs See “—Our Organizational Structure—Structure of Newmark Following the Spin-Off.” 
 We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and retaining key employees. We believe that many brokers are attracted by the opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitle our partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving Newmark Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests), any such partners will only be entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner’s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any goodwill or going concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of Newmark Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners will be able to receive the right to exchange their Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of our Class A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, we, as the Newmark Holdings general partner, with Cantor’s consent, determine otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value associated with our Class A common stock. We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the health and performance of our business and have a strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability. See “—Our Organizational Structure—Structure of Newmark Following the Spin-Off,” and “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Relationship with Cantor and Its Respective Affiliates.” 
 Relationship with Cantor 
 See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Relationship with Cantor and Its Respective Affiliates.” 
 Regulation 
 The brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions, property and facilities management, conducting real estate valuation and securing debt for clients, among other business lines, also require that we comply with regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Like other market participants that operate in numerous jurisdictions and in various business lines, we must comply with numerous regulatory regimes. 
 We could be required to pay fines, return commissions, have a license suspended or revoked, or be subject to other adverse action if we conduct regulated activities without a license or violate applicable rules and regulations. Licensing requirements could also impact our ability to engage in certain types of transactions, change the way in which we conduct business or affect the cost of conducting business. We and our licensed associates may be subject to various obligations and we could become subject to claims by regulators and/or participants in real estate sales or other services claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations. This could include claims with respect to alleged conflicts of interest where we act, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients. While management has overseen highly regulated businesses before and expects us to comply with all applicable regulations in a satisfactory manner, no assurance can be given that it will always be the case. In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations that impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to such properties. In our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes relating to properties we currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed without regard for the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, 
 25

the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these may be joint and several, meaning that one of multiple liable parties could be responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. Certain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and potentially subject us to violations or claims by regulatory agencies or others. Additionally, under certain circumstances, failure by our brokers acting as agents for a seller or lessor to disclose environmental contamination at a property could result in liability to a buyer or lessee of an affected property. 
 We are required to meet and maintain various eligibility criteria from time to time established by the GSEs and HUD, as well as applicable state and local licensing agencies, to maintain our status as an approved lender. These criteria include minimum net worth, operational liquidity and collateral requirements, and compliance with reporting requirements. We also are required to originate our loans and perform our loan servicing functions in accordance with the applicable program requirements and guidelines from time to time established by the GSEs and HUD. For additional information, see “Item—1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Regulatory/Legal—The loss of relationships with the GSEs and HUD would, and changes in such relationships could, adversely affect our ability to originate commercial real estate loans through such programs. Compliance with the minimum collateral and risk-sharing requirements of such programs, as well as applicable state and local licensing agencies, could reduce our liquidity.” 
 As a result of the Berkeley Point Acquisition, Newmark is now subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that Newmark has entered into with the various GSEs. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Newmark’s inability to originate and service loans for the respective GSEs and could have a direct material adverse effect on Newmark’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, Newmark has met all capital requirements. As of December 31, 2018, the most restrictive capital requirement was Fannie Mae’s net worth requirement. Newmark exceeded the minimum requirement by $322.3 million. 
 Certain of Newmark’s agreements with Fannie Mae allow Newmark to originate and service loans under Fannie Mae’s DUS Program. These agreements require Newmark to maintain sufficient collateral to meet Fannie Mae’s restricted and operational liquidity requirements based on a pre-established formula. Certain of Newmark’s agreements with Freddie Mac allow Newmark to service loans under Freddie Mac’s Targeted Affordable Housing Program (“TAH”). These agreements require Newmark to pledge sufficient collateral to meet Freddie Mac’s liquidity requirement of 8% of the outstanding principal of TAH loans serviced by Newmark. As of December 31, 2018, Newmark has met all liquidity requirements. 
 In addition, as a servicer for Fannie Mae, GNMA and FHA, Newmark is required to advance to investors any uncollected principal and interest due from borrowers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, outstanding borrower advances were approximately $164 thousand and $120 thousand, respectively, and are included in “Other assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 In order to continue our business in our current structure, we and Newmark Holdings must not be deemed investment companies under the Investment Company Act. We intend to take all legally permissible action to ensure that such entities not be subject to such act. For additional information, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate and Partnership Structure—If we or Newmark Holdings were deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, the Investment Company Act’s restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business and structure as contemplated and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 5,200 total employees, of which approximately 1,700 were brokers and commissioned salespeople. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,044 employees that were fully reimbursed by our property management or facilities management clients to whom we provide services and pass through such employee expense. 
 26

Generally, our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, except for certain employees that are reimbursed by our property management or facilities management clients.

OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
 Our Restructuring 
 We are Newmark Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation. We were formed as NRE Delaware, Inc. on November 18, 2016 and changed our name to Newmark Group, Inc. on October 18, 2017. We were formed for the purpose of becoming a public company conducting the operations of BGC Partners’ Real Estate Services segment, including Newmark and Berkeley Point. In December 2017, Newmark completed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 23 million shares of its Class A common stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share. Prior to the IPO, Newmark was a wholly owned subsidiary of BGC Partners.
 Initially, a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by BGC Partners. Through the following series of transactions prior to and following the completion of the Separation and our IPO, we became a separate publicly traded company. 
 Prior to the completion of our IPO, the separation and contribution pursuant to which members of the BGC Group transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the BGC Partners’ Real Estate Services segment, including Newmark, Berkeley Point and the right to receive the remainder of the Nasdaq payment, (the “Contribution”), various types of interests of Newmark Holdings were issued to holders of interests of BGC Holdings in proportion to such interests of BGC Holdings held by such holders immediately prior thereto. 
  
• | Concurrently with the Separation and Contribution, we entered into the transactions described under “Item 7— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Separation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off.”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In March 2018, BGC Partners made an additional investment in us as described under “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Separation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off—BGC Partners March 2018 Investment by BGC.”

• | The types of interests in Newmark, Newmark Holdings and Newmark OpCo outstanding following the completion of these transactions are described under “— Newmark Organizational Structure Following the Spin-Off below.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Separation and Contribution 
 Prior to the completion of the IPO, pursuant to the Original Separation and Distribution Agreement, (“as defined below”), members of the BGC Group transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the BGC group relating to BGC Partners’ Real Estate Services segment, including Newmark, Berkeley Point and the right to receive the remainder of the Nasdaq Earn-out. For a description of the Nasdaq Earn-out, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Nasdaq Monetization Transactions.”  Prior to the Separation, the BGC Group held all of the historical assets and liabilities related to our business. 
 In connection with the Separation, Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests, Newmark Holdings founding partner interests, Newmark Holdings working partner interests and Newmark Holdings limited partnership units were distributed to holders of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, BGC Holdings founding partner interests, BGC Holdings working partner interests and BGC Holdings limited partnership units, respectively, in proportion to such interests of BGC Holdings held by such holders immediately prior to the Separation. 
 We also entered into a tax matters agreement with BGC Partners that governs the parties’ respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Separation with respect to taxes, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of 
 27

tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings, tax elections, assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters, procedures and restrictions relating to the Spin-Off, if any, and certain other tax matters. We also entered into an administrative services agreement with Cantor, which governs the provision by Cantor of various administrative services to us, and our provision of various administrative services to Cantor, at a cost equal to (1) the direct cost that the providing party incurs in performing those services, including third-party charges incurred in providing services, plus (2) a reasonable allocation of other costs determined in a consistent and fair manner so as to cover the providing party’s appropriate costs or in such other manner as the parties agree. We also entered into a transition services agreement with BGC Partners, which governs the provision by BGC Partners of various administrative services to us, and our provision of various administrative services to BGC Partners, on a transitional basis (with a term of up to two years following the Spin-Off) and at a cost equal to (1) the direct cost that the providing party incurs in performing those services, including third-party charges incurred in providing services, plus (2) a reasonable allocation of other costs determined in a consistent and fair manner so as to cover the providing party’s appropriate costs or in such other manner as the parties agree. 
 Assumption and Repayment of Indebtedness
For a description of Newmark’s assumption and repayment of certain indebtedness prior to the Spin-Off, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Separation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off—Debt Repayments and Credit Agreements.”
 BGC Partners March 2018 Investment 
 On March 7, 2018, BGC Partners and its operating subsidiaries purchased 16,606,726 newly issued exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings for an aggregate investment of approximately $242.0 million. The price per unit was based on the $14.57 closing price of our Class A common stock on March 6, 2018 as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. These units are exchangeable, at BGC Partners’ discretion, into either shares of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share. Following such issuance, BGC Partners owned 83.4% of our 138.6 million shares of Class A common issued and outstanding on March 7, 2018 and 100% of our 15.8 million issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock. 
Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement
 For a description of the Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Separation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off—Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement.”
 The Spin-Off 
 On November 30, 2018 , BGC completed the Spin-Off to its stockholders of all of the shares of our common stock owned by BGC as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off, with shares of our Class A common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC’s Class A common stock (including directors and executive officers of BGC Partners) of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2018 (the “Record Date”), and shares of our Class B common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC’s Class B common stock (consisting of Cantor and CFGM) of record as of the close of business on the Record Date. 
 28

Based on the number of shares of BGC common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, BGC’s stockholders as of the Record Date received in the Spin-Off 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class A common stock for each share of BGC Class A common stock held as of the Record Date, and 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class B common stock for each share of BGC Class B common stock held as of the Record Date. BGC Partners stockholders received cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Newmark common stock that they otherwise would have received in the Spin-Off. 
 Prior to and in connection with the Spin-Off, 14.8 million Newmark Units held by BGC were exchanged into 9.4 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock and 5.4 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock, and 7.0 million Newmark OpCo Units held by BGC were exchanged into 6.9 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. These Newmark Class A and Class B shares of common stock were included in the Spin-Off to BGC’s stockholders. In the aggregate, BGC distributed 131,886,409 shares of our Class A common stock and 21,285,537 shares of our Class B common stock to BGC’s stockholders in the Spin-Off. These shares of our common stock collectively represented approximately 94% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and approximately 87% of the total economics of our outstanding common stock in each case as of the Distribution Date. 
 On November 30, 2018, BGC Partners also caused its subsidiary, BGC Holdings, to distribute pro-rata (the “BGC Holdings distribution”) all of the 1,458,931 exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings, held by BGC Holdings immediately prior to the effective time of the BGC Holdings distribution to its limited partners entitled to receive distributions on their BGC Holdings units (including Cantor and executive officers of BGC) who were holders of record of such units as of the Record Date. The Newmark Holdings units distributed to BGC Holdings partners in the BGC Holdings distribution are exchangeable for shares of Newmark Class A common stock, and in the case of the 449,917 Newmark Holdings units received by Cantor also into shares of Newmark Class B common stock, at the applicable exchange ratio (subject to adjustment). As of December 31, 2018, the exchange ratio was 0.9793 shares of Newmark common stock per Newmark Holdings unit.
 Following the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution, BGC Partners ceased to be our controlling stockholder, and BGC and its subsidiaries no longer held any shares of our common stock or other equity interests in us or our subsidiaries. Cantor continues to control Newmark and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution. 
 Prior to the Spin-Off, 100% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock were held by BGC. Because 100% of the outstanding shares of BGC Class B common stock were held by Cantor and CFGM as of the Record Date, 100% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock were distributed to Cantor and CFGM in the Spin-Off. As of the Distribution Date, shares of our Class B common stock represented 57.8% of the total voting power of the outstanding Newmark common stock and 12.1% of the total economics of the outstanding Newmark common stock. Cantor is controlled by CFGM, its managing general partner, and, ultimately, by Howard W. Lutnick, who serves as Chairman of Newmark. Mr. Lutnick is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of BGC Partners and Cantor and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CFGM, as well as the trustee of an entity that is the sole shareholder of CFGM. Stephen M. Merkel, our Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer serves as Executive Vice President General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of BGC Partners, and is employed as Executive Managing Director, General Counsel and Secretary of Cantor.

Newmark Organizational Structure Following the Spin-Off
 As of December 31, 2018, there were 156,966,334 shares of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding. Cantor and CFGM held no shares of our Class A common stock. Each share of Class A common stock is generally entitled to one vote on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, Cantor and CFGM held 21,285,533 shares of our Class B common stock representing all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. The shares of Class B common stock held by Cantor and CFGM as of December 31, 2018, represented approximately 57.6% of our total voting power. Each share of Class B common stock is generally entitled to the same rights as a share of Class A common stock, except that, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes. The Class B common stock generally votes together with the Class A common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. We expect to retain our dual class structure, and there are no circumstances under which the holders of Class B common stock would be required to convert their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation referred to herein as our certificate of incorporation does not provide for automatic conversion of shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock upon the occurrence of any event.
 We hold the Newmark Holdings general partnership interest and the Newmark Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of Newmark Holdings and serve as the general partner of Newmark Holdings, which entitles us to control Newmark Holdings. Newmark Holdings, in turn, holds the Newmark OpCo general partnership interest and the Newmark OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle Newmark Holdings to remove and appoint the general partner of Newmark OpCo, and serve as the general partner of Newmark OpCo, which entitles Newmark Holdings (and thereby us) to control Newmark OpCo. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we directly held Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests consisting of approximately 85,120,661 units representing approximately 32.3% of the outstanding Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests (not including EPUs). We are a holding company that holds these interests, serves as the general partner of Newmark Holdings and, through Newmark Holdings, acts as the general partner of Newmark OpCo. As a result of our ownership of the general partnership interest in Newmark Holdings and Newmark Holdings’ general partnership interest in Newmark OpCo, we will consolidate Newmark OpCo’s results for financial reporting purposes.
 Cantor, founding partners, working partners and limited partnership unit holders directly hold Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests. Newmark Holdings, in turn, holds Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests and, as a result, Cantor, founding partners, working partners and limited partnership unit holders indirectly have interests in Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests. In addition, The Royal Bank of Canada holds approximately $325 million of EPUs issued by Newmark on June 18, 2018 and September 26, 2018 in private transactions.
 The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by Cantor and CFGM are designated as Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by the founding partners are designated as Newmark Holdings founding partner interests. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by the working partners are designated as Newmark Holdings working partner interests. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by the limited partnership unit holders are designated as limited partnership units.
 Each unit of Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by Cantor and CFGM is generally exchangeable with us for a number of shares of Class B common stock (or, at Cantor’s option or if there are no additional authorized but unissued shares of Class B common stock, a number of shares of Class A common stock) equal to the exchange ratio (which was initially one, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement) and was 0.9793 as of December 31, 2018.
 As of December 31, 2018, 5,402,901 founding/working partner interests were outstanding. These founding/working partner were issued in the Separation to holders of BGC Holdings founding/working partner interests, who received such founding/working partner interests in connection with BGC Partners’ acquisition of the BGC Partners business from Cantor in 2008. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by founding/working partners are not exchangeable with us unless (1) Cantor acquires such interests from Newmark Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of the founding/working partners or redemption of their units by Newmark Holdings (which it has the right to do under certain circumstances), in which case such interests will be 
 30

exchangeable with us for our Class A common stock or Class B common stock as described above, or (2) Cantor determines that such interests can be exchanged by such founding/working partners with us for our Class A common stock, with each Newmark Holdings unit exchangeable for a number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to the exchange ratio (which was initially one, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement), on terms and conditions to be determined by Cantor (which exchange of certain interests Cantor expects to permit from time to time). Cantor has provided that certain founding/working partner interests are exchangeable with us for Class A common stock, with each Newmark Holdings unit exchangeable for a number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to the exchange ratio (which was initially one, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement), in accordance with the terms of the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. Once a Newmark Holdings founding/working partner interest becomes exchangeable, such founding/working partner interest is automatically exchanged upon a termination or bankruptcy with us for our Class A common stock.
 Further, we provide exchangeability for partnership units under other circumstances in connection with (1) our partnership redemption, compensation and restructuring programs, (2) other incentive compensation arrangements and (3) business combination transactions.
 As of December 31, 2018, 60,869,397 limited partnership units were outstanding (including founding/working partner interests and working partner interests, and units held by Cantor). Limited partnership units will be only exchangeable with us in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant of such units, which terms and conditions are determined in our sole discretion, as the Newmark Holdings general partner, with the consent of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interest majority in interest, in accordance with the terms of the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement.
 The exchange ratio between Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests and our common stock was initially one. However, this exchange ratio will be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement if our dividend policy and the distribution policy of Newmark Holdings are different. As of December 31, 2018, the exchange ratio was 0.9793. See “Item 5—Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Purchased of Equity Securities—Dividend Policy.” 
 With each exchange, our direct and indirect interest in Newmark OpCo will proportionately increase because, immediately following an exchange, Newmark Holdings will redeem the Newmark Holdings unit so acquired for the Newmark OpCo limited partnership interest underlying such Newmark Holdings unit.
 The profit and loss of Newmark OpCo and Newmark Holdings, as the case may be, are allocated based on the total number of Newmark OpCo units (not including EPUs) and Newmark Holdings units, as the case may be, outstanding. 
 The following diagram illustrates the ownership structure of Newmark as of December 31, 2018. The diagram does not reflect the various subsidiaries of Newmark, Newmark OpCo or Cantor (including certain operating subsidiaries that are organized as corporations whose equity is either wholly owned by Newmark or whose equity is majority-owned by Newmark with the remainder owned by Newmark OpCo) or the results of any exchange of Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests or, to the extent applicable, Newmark Holdings founding partner interests, Newmark Holdings working partner interests or Newmark Holdings limited partnership units. In addition, the diagram does not reflect the Newmark OpCo exchangeable preferred limited partnership units, or EPUs, since they are not allocated any gains or losses of Newmark OpCo for tax purposes and are not entitled to regular distributions from Newmark OpCo.

STRUCTURE OF NEWMARK AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 
 
32


Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at any time in the discretion of the holder on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, if Cantor and CFGM converted all of their shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock, Cantor and CFGM would hold 11.9% of the voting power in Newmark and the stockholders of Newmark other than Cantor and CFGM would hold 88.1% of the voting power in Newmark (and the indirect economic interests in Newmark OpCo would remain unchanged). In addition, if Cantor and CFGM continued to hold our Class B common stock and if Cantor exchanged all of the exchangeable limited partnership units held by Cantor for our Class B common stock, Cantor and CFGM would hold 74.4% of the voting power in Newmark, and the stockholders of Newmark other than Cantor and CFGM would hold 25.6% of the voting power in Newmark.
