ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our business and residential customers. Our specific products and services are detailed below under the heading "Operations - Products and Services."
Our ultimate parent company, CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink"), has cash management arrangements between certain of its subsidiaries that include lines of credit, affiliate obligations, capital contributions and dividends. As part of these cash management arrangements, affiliates provide lines of credit to certain other affiliates. Amounts outstanding under these lines of credit and intercompany obligations vary from time to time. Under these arrangements, the majority of our cash balance is advanced on a daily basis for centralized management by CenturyLink. From time to time we may declare and pay dividends to Qwest Services Corporation ("QSC"), our direct parent, using cash owed to us under these advances, which has the net effect of reducing the amount of these advances. We report the balance of these transfers on our consolidated balance sheet as advances to affiliates.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado in 1911.

Operations 
For the reasons noted in Note 12—Products and Services Revenue to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, we believe we have one reportable segment. 
Products and Services 
While most of our customized customer interactions involve multiple integrated technologies and services, we organize our products and services according to the core technologies that drive them. We report our related revenue under the following categories: IP and data services, transport and infrastructure services, voice and collaboration services, IT and managed services, regulatory revenue and affiliate services, each of which is described in further detail below. 
6

IP and Data Services

• | Ethernet. We deliver a robust array of networking services built on Ethernet technology. Ethernet services include point-to-point and multi-point equipment configurations that facilitate data transmissions across metropolitan areas and larger enterprise-class wide area networks. Our Ethernet technology is also used by wireless service providers for data transmission via our fiber-optic cables connected to their towers; and


• | Retail Video. Our video services span a range of technologies aimed at consumers and business customers. We also offer various broadcast services to deliver audio and video feeds over fiber or satellite for broadcast and production firms

Transport and Infrastructure

• | Broadband. Our broadband services deliver a cost-effective Internet connection through existing telephone lines or fiber-optic cables while companies enjoy high speed data transfer. A substantial portion of our broadband subscribers are located within the local service area of our wireline telephone operations;


• | Private Line. We deliver a private line (including business data services), a direct circuit or channel specifically dedicated for connecting two or more organizational sites. Private line service offers a high-speed, secure solution for frequent transmission of large amounts of data between sites, including wireless backhaul transmissions;


• | Unbundled Network Elements and Other. We provide select technology elements to other network carriers on a regional basis for the inclusion of those technologies in their offerings; and


• | Wavelength. We deliver high bandwidth optical networks to firms requiring an end-to-end transport solution with Ethernet technology by contracting for a scalable amount of bandwidth connecting sites or providing high-speed access to cloud computing resources.

Voice and Collaboration

• | Voice. We offer a complete portfolio of traditional Time Division Multiplexing ("TDM") voice services to businesses and enterprises including Primary Rate Interface (“PRI”) service, local inbound service, switched one-plus, toll free, long distance and international services.

IT and Managed Services

• | Information Technology ("IT") Services. Our IT-based services deliver strategic consulting and solutions to C-suite executives in mid to large enterprises. Services involve architecting technologies to address business needs. Solutions range from System Integration Services to Big Data Analytics, building and managing strategic application suites such as SAP and deploying security technologies. In many cases, we operate and manage these solutions on behalf of customers once they are deployed.

Regulatory Revenue

• | Universal Service Fund ("USF") support payments. We receive federal and state USF support payment subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to fully recover our costs from our customers; and


• | Connect America Fund ("CAF"). We receive federal support payments from CAF II of the CAF program. The funding from the CAF II support program has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in 33 states.

7

Affiliate Revenue

• | Affiliate Services. We provide to our affiliates, telecommunication services that we also provide to external customers. Please see our products and services listed above for further description of these services. In addition, we provide to our affiliates computer system development and support services, network support and technical services.

From time to time, we may change the categorization of our products and services.
Additional Information
For further information on regulatory, technological and competitive factors that could impact our revenue, see "Regulation" and "Competition" under this Item 1 below and "Risk Factors" under Item 1A below. For more information on the financial contributions of our various services, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Our Network 
Most of our products and services are provided using our telecommunications network, which consists of fiber-optic and copper cables, high-speed transport equipment, data switches and routers, voice switches and other equipment. Our local exchange carrier networks also include central offices and remote site assets, and form a portion of the public switched telephone network. A substantial portion of our equipment operates with licensed software. 
We continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying various technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. Rapid and significant changes in technology are expected to continue in the telecommunications industry. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and customer demands, including demands for enhanced digitization, automation and customer self-service capabilities. In addition, we anticipate that continued increases in internet usage by our customers will require us to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity or to implement network management practices to alleviate network capacity shortages. The FCC's definition of broadband service could create additional requirements for higher capital spending to address marketing and competitive issues. Any such additional expenditure could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Similarly, we continue to take steps to simplify and modernize our network. To attain our objectives, we plan to continue to pursue several complex projects that we expect will be costly and may take several years to complete. The costs of these projects could materially increase if we conclude that we need to replace any or all of our legacy systems.
Like other large communications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees, which has caused us to spend increasingly more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks. Some of the attacks result in security breaches, and we periodically notify our customers, our employees or the public of these breaches when necessary or appropriate. None of these resulting security breaches to date have materially adversely affected our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Similarly, like other large communication companies operating complex networks, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service. Although none of these outages have thus far materially adversely affected us, certain of these outages have resulted in regulatory fines, negative publicity, service credits and other adverse consequences. 
We rely on several other communications companies to provide our offerings. We lease a portion of our core fiber network from our competitors and other third parties. Many of these leases will lapse in future years. A portion of our services are provided by other carriers under agency agreements or through reselling arrangements with other carriers. Our future ability to provide services on the terms of our current offerings will depend in part upon our ability to renew or replace these leases, agreements and arrangements on terms substantially similar to those currently in effect.

For additional information regarding our systems, network assets, network risks, capital expenditure requirements and reliance upon third parties, see "Risk Factors," generally, in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and, in particular, "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business" and "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources." For more information on our properties, see "Properties" in Item 2 of Part I of this report.
Patents, Trade Names, Trademarks and Copyrights
Either directly or through our affiliates, we have rights in various patents, trade names, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property necessary to conduct our business. Our services often use the intellectual property of others, including licensed software. We also occasionally license our intellectual property to others as we deem appropriate.
Our patent portfolio includes patents covering technologies ranging from data and voice services to content distribution to transmission and networking equipment. Patents give us the right to prevent others, particularly competitors, from using our proprietary technologies. Patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patent that has been licensed to us. We, or our affiliates, plan to continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, and we plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices, or are named in lawsuits, alleging that our products or services infringe on patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. In certain instances, these matters can potentially adversely impact our operations, operating results or financial position. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business” in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and Note 15—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Sales and Marketing
We maintain local offices in most of the larger population centers within our local service area. These offices provide sales and customer support services to the communities in our local markets. We also rely on our call center personnel and a variety of channel partners to promote sales of services that meet the needs of our customers. Our sales and marketing strategy is to enhance our sales by offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customers and promoting our brands. Our offerings include both stand-alone services and bundled services designed to meet the needs of different customer segments.
We conduct most of our operations under the brand name "CenturyLink." Our satellite television service is offered on a co-branded basis under the "DIRECTV" name. 
Our sales and marketing approach to our residential customers emphasizes customer-oriented sales, marketing and service with a local presence. Our marketing plans include marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including retailers, satellite television providers, door to door sales agents and digital marketing firms. We support our distribution with digital marketing, direct mail, bill inserts, newspaper and television advertising, website promotions, public relations activities and sponsorship of community events and sports venues.
Similarly, our sales and marketing approach to our business customers includes a commitment to provide comprehensive communications solutions for business, wholesale and government customers of all sizes, ranging from small business offices to select enterprise customers. We strive to offer our business customers stable, reliable, secure and trusted solutions. Our marketing plans include marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including telecommunications agents, system integrators, value-added resellers and other telecommunications firms. We support our distribution through digital advertising, events, television advertising, website promotions and public relations.

Regulation
Overview
Our domestic operations are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), various state utility commissions and occasionally by local agencies. 
The following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that affect our operations, but numerous other regulations not discussed below also have a substantial impact on us. For additional information, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Federal Regulation
General
The FCC regulates the interstate services we provide, including the business data service charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and intercarrier compensation, including the interstate access charges that we bill to long-distance companies and other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate phone calls. Additionally, the FCC regulates a number of aspects of our business related to international communications services, privacy, public safety and network infrastructure, including our access to and use of local telephone numbers and our provision of emergency 911 services. 
In April 2017, the FCC revised the regulation of the provision of data services to businesses providing greater freedom to respond to competition for these business data services. Several parties appealed the FCC's decision and the resulting remand proceedings remain pending. The ultimate impact on us of the FCC's recent actions is currently unknown.
Universal Service
In 2015, CenturyLink accepted Connect America Fund or "CAF" funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states under the CAF II high-cost support program. Of these amounts, approximately $150 million is attributable to our service area, to provide service to approximately 0.3 million rural households and business in 13 of the 14 states in which we are the ILEC. The funding from the CAF II support program in these 13 states has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF high-cost program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in these 13 states. As a result of accepting CAF II support payments, we are obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build infrastructure by certain specified milestone deadlines. For information on the risks associated with participating in this program, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Currently, it is unclear when the FCC will complete the development of the next phase of the CAF program expected to follow the CAF Phase II program and what that plan will entail. Although the FCC has taken certain initial steps, we cannot assure you when such replacement plan will be proposed or implemented.
For additional information about the potential financial impact of the CAF II program, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Broadband Regulation
In February 2015, the FCC adopted an order classifying Broadband Internet Access Services ("BIAS") under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and applying new regulations. In December 2017, the FCC voted to repeal most of those regulations and the classification of BIAS as a Title II service and to preclude states from imposing substantial regulations of their own on broadband. Opponents of this change have appealed this action in federal court and have advocated in favor of re-instituting regulation of Internet services under Title II of the Communications Act. Several states have also opposed the change and have initiated state executive orders or introduced legislation focused on state-specific Internet service regulation. The result of these appeals is pending and the potential impact to us is currently unknown.
10

State Regulation of Domestic Operations
In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs. Nonetheless, some state regulatory commissions continue to (i) set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, (ii) administer support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas, (iii) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (iv) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (v) limit ILECs' ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (vi) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vii) impose various other service standards. In most states, local voice service, switched and business data services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region.
We operate in states where traditional cost recovery mechanisms, including rate structures and state USF,
are under evaluation or have been modified. Recent changes to the federal tax code have prompted several states
to review regulated rates. As laws and regulations change, there can be no assurance that these mechanisms will
continue to provide us with any cost recovery.
Other Regulations
Our networks are subject to numerous local regulations, including codes that regulate our trenching and construction operations or that require us to obtain permits, licenses or franchises to operate. Such regulations are enacted by municipalities, counties or other regional governmental bodies, and can vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as a result. Such regulations may also require us to pay substantial fees. 
Various federal and state laws govern our storage, maintenance and use of customer data, including a wide range of consumer protection, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and similar laws. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Various federal and state legislative or regulatory bodies have recently adopted increasingly restrictive laws or regulations governing the protection or retention of data, and others are contemplating similar actions. 
For additional information about these matters, see “Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters” in item 1A of Part I of this report.
Competition
General
We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, and we expect intense competition from a wide variety of sources under evolving market conditions to continue. In addition to competition from larger telecommunication service providers, we are facing increasing competition from several other sources, including cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, technology companies, cloud companies, broadband providers, device providers, resellers, sales agents facilities-based providers, and smaller more narrowly focused niche providers either using their own networks leasing parts of our network, or providing services such as VoIP, SD-WAN and security independent of network assets. The ability to provide such services independently of the network challenges more traditional solution selling. Further technological advances and regulatory and legislative changes have increased opportunities for a wide range of alternative communications service providers, which in turn have increased competitive pressures on our business. These alternate providers often face fewer regulations and have lower cost structures than we do. In addition, the communications industry has, in recent years, experienced substantial consolidation, and some of our competitors in one or more lines of our business are generally larger, have stronger brand names, have more financial and business resources and have broader service offerings than we currently do.
11

Wireless voice services are a significant source of competition with our traditional ILEC services. It is increasingly common for customers to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly with younger customers who are less accustomed to using traditional wireline voice services. Technological and regulatory developments in wireless services, Wi-Fi, and other wired and wireless technologies have contributed to the development of alternatives to traditional landline voice services. Moreover, the growing prevalence of electronic mail, text messaging, social networking and similar digital non-voice communications services continues to reduce the demand for traditional landline voice services. These factors have led to a long-term systemic decline in the number of our wireline voice service customers.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which obligates ILECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the ILEC's network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, imposes several duties on an ILEC if it receives a specific request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services using the ILEC's network. In addition, each ILEC is obligated to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide nondiscriminatory "unbundled" access to all aspects of the ILEC's network, (iii) offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv) permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to colocate their physical plant on the ILEC's property, or provide virtual colocation if physical colocation is not practicable. Current FCC rules require ILECs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network elements, and where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of facilities-based competition.
As a result of these regulatory, consumer and technological developments, ILECs also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through (i) reselling an ILEC's local services, (ii) using an ILEC's unbundled network elements or (iii) operating their own facilities.
Technological developments have led to the development of new products and services that have reduced the demand for our traditional services, as noted above, or that compete with traditional ILEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies continue to aggressively market these services. Similarly, companies providing VoIP services provide voice communication services over the Internet which compete with our traditional telephone service and our own VoIP services. In addition, demand for our broadband services could be adversely affected by advanced wireless data transmission technologies being deployed by wireless providers and by certain technologies permitting cable companies and other competitors to deliver generally faster average broadband transmission speeds than ours.
Similar to us, many cable, technology or other communications companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements or joint ventures. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for and pricing of our services.
As both residential and business customers increasingly demand high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect the demands on our network will continue to increase over the next several years. To succeed, we must continue to invest in our network to ensure that it can deliver competitive services that meet these increasing bandwidth and speed requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in our business.
In addition to facing direct competition from those providers described above, ILECs increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems constructed by long distance carriers, large customers, municipalities or alternative access vendors. These systems are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of an ILEC's networks or switching services. Other potential sources of competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing ILECs' local networks, either partially or completely, through various means, including the provision of business data services or independent switching services and the concentration of telecommunications traffic on a few of an ILEC's access lines. We anticipate that all these trends will continue and lead to decreased billable use of our networks.
12

Although our status as an ILEC continues to provide us advantages in providing local services in our local service area, as noted above, we increasingly face significant competition as an increasing number of consumers are willing to substitute cable, wireless and electronic communications for traditional voice telecommunications services. This has led to an increase in the number and type of competitors within our industry, price compression and a decrease in our market share. As a result of this product substitution, we face greater competition in providing local services from wireless providers, resellers and sales agents (including ourselves), social media hosts and broadband service providers, including cable companies. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly as wireless services providers continue to improve their service offerings and our older legacy customers are replaced over time with younger customers who are less accustomed to using traditional wireline voice services. We also continue to compete with traditional telecommunications providers, such as national carriers, smaller regional providers, CLECs and independent telephone companies.
Some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulations than we are, which affords them competitive advantages against us. Under federal regulations, telecommunication providers are able to interconnect their networks with ours, resell our services or lease separate parts of our network in order to provide competitive services. Generally, we have been required to provide these functions and services at wholesale rates to our competitors, which allow our competitors to sell their services at lower prices. However, these rules have been and continue to be reviewed by state and federal regulators. In addition, wireless and broadband service providers generally are subject to fewer regulations, which may allow them to operate with lower costs than we are able to operate. For additional discussion of regulations affecting our business, see "Regulation" above.
As discussed below, competition for many of our services is based in part on bundled offerings. We believe our customers value the convenience of, and price discounts associated with, receiving multiple services through a single company. As such, we continue to focus on expanding and improving our bundled offerings.
Additional information about competitive pressures is located (i) under the heading "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and (ii) in the discussion immediately below, which contains more specific information on how these trends in competition have impacted our services.
Environmental Compliance
From time to time we may incur environmental compliance and remediation expenses, mainly resulting from owning or operating prior industrial sites or operating vehicle fleets or power supplies for our communications equipment. Although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations or provide you with any assurances regarding the ultimate impact thereof, we do not currently believe that future environmental compliance and remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and Note 15—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Seasonality
Overall, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. Our network-related operating expenses are, however, generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. From time to time, weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our markets. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year, but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms, including hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes in our markets along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 19,000 employees, of which approximately 8,400 are members of either the Communications Workers of America ("CWA") or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW"). See the discussion of risks relating to our labor relations in "Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and see Note 17—Labor Union Contracts to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, for additional information on the timing of certain contract expirations.
