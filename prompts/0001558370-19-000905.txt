 Item 1.  Business.
 South State Corporation, headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, is a bank holding company incorporated in 1985 under the laws of South Carolina.  We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly‑owned bank subsidiary, South State Bank (the “Bank”), a South Carolina‑chartered commercial bank that opened for business in 1934.  The Bank operates South State Advisory, Inc. (formerly First Southeast 401k Fiduciaries), a wholly-owned registered investment advisor.  We merged Minis & Co., Inc., another registered investment advisor that was wholly-owned by the Bank, with and into South State Advisory effective January 1, 2019.  We will continue to use the name Minis & Co., Inc. as a Doing Business As (DBA) going forward.  We do not engage in any significant operations other than the ownership of our banking subsidiary.
 Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, references herein to “South State,” the “Company” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar references mean South State Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to the “Bank” means South State Bank.
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. We coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and thereby maintain financial, operation and administrative systems that allow centralized evaluation of subsidiary operations and coordination of selected policies and activities. The Company’s operating revenues and net income are derived primarily from cash dividends received from our Bank.
 Our Bank provides a full range of retail and commercial banking services, mortgage lending services, trust and wealth management, and consumer loans through financial centers in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia . At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $14.7 billion in assets, $11.0 billion in loans, $11.6 billion in deposits, $2.4 billion in shareholders’ equity, and a market capitalization of approximately $2.1 billion.
 Our Bank began operating in 1934 in Orangeburg, South Carolina and has maintained our ability to provide high quality customer service while also leveraging our size to offer some products more common to larger banks. We have pursued a growth strategy that relies on organic growth supplemented by the acquisition of select financial institutions or branches in certain market areas.
 In recent years, we have continued to grow our business under our guiding principles of soundness, profitability and growth. Below are highlights of our expansion efforts over the past three years:

· | On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Park Sterling Corporation (“PSC”), of Charlotte, North Carolina, the bank holding company for Park Sterling Bank (“PSB”), in a stock-for-stock merger. PSC common shareholders received 0.14 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of PSC common stock resulting in the Company issuing 7,480,343 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for PSC was $693.0 million including the value of “in the money” outstanding stock options totaling $4.3 million. As a result of the merger, we added 53 locations to the Bank’s footprint, consisting of five offices in Georgia, 23 offices in South Carolina, 17 offices in North Carolina and eight offices in Virginia.

· | On January 3, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Southeastern Bank financial Corporation (“SBFC”), of Augusta, Georgia, the bank holding company for Georgia Bank & Trust Company of Augusta (“GB&T”), in a stock-for-stock merger. SBFC common shareholders received 0.7307 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of SBFC common stock resulting in the Company issuing 4,978,338 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for SBFC was $435.1 million including the value of “in the money” outstanding stock options totaling

 Lending Activities
 We believe we have a strong team of consumer and commercial bankers to execute on a client-centered, relationship-driven banking model. Our commercial banking team focuses on businesses with an advisory approach that emphasizes understanding the client’s business and offering a broad suite of loan, deposit and treasury management products and services. Our consumer banking team consists of experienced professionals that focus on knowing their individual clients in order to best meet their financial needs, offering a full complement of loan, deposit and online banking solutions. We strive to do business in the areas served by our branches, which are also where our marketing is focused, and the vast majority of our new loan customers are located in existing market areas. 
 Our loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. The principal risk associated with each category of loans we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the attributes of the borrower and the borrower’s market or industry. Attributes of the relevant business market or industry include the competitive environment, customer and supplier availability, the threat of substitutes and barriers to entry and exit.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2018, $5.6 billion, or 51%, of our bank loan portfolio consisted of loan secured by commercial real estate (including owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction and land development lending). We offer construction financing, acquisition or refinancing of properties, commercial lines of credit and other loans that are secured by commercial real estate.

Residential Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2018, $3.5 billion, or 32%, of our bank loan portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans. We provide one-to-four family residential real estate loans with terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates and home equity lines.  It is not our normal business practice to originate subprime loans. Loans are typically closed-end first lien loans for purposes of property purchased, or for refinancing existing loans. The majority of our loans are owner occupied, full documentation loans.
 Commercial and Industrial Loans (“C&I”). As of December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion, or 12%, of our total bank loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans. Our C&I loans include lines of credit, acquisition finance credit facilities and other types of commercial credit, and typically have maturities of five years or less.

     Other Consumer Loans. As of December 31, 2018, $603 million, or 5%, of our bank loan portfolio consisted of other types of consumer loans. We offer consumer loans to our customers for personal, family and household purposes, including auto, boat and personal installment loans.
 Deposit Products, Treasury Services and Other Funding Sources
 We offer our customers a variety of deposit products and services, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, other deposit accounts and treasury and merchant services, through multiple channels, including our extensive network of 168 full-service branches, as of December 31, 2018, and our online, mobile and telephone banking platforms.  As of December 31, 2018, our deposit portfolio was comprised of 26% noninterest-bearing deposits and 74% interest bearing deposits. We intend to continue our efforts to provide funding for our business from customer relationship deposits.
 Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located in areas surrounding our branches, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets. In order to attract and retain deposits, we rely on providing quality service, offering a suite of retail and commercial products and services and introducing new products and services that meet our customers’ needs as they evolve. 
 In addition to traditional banking activities and the other products and services specified above, we provide a broad array of financial services to our customers, including: debit card products, treasury management services, merchant services, automated clearing house services, lock-box services remote deposit capture services and other treasury services.
 Wealth Management
 Through South State Bank and South State Advisory, we offer wealth management and other fiduciary and private banking services targeted to affluent clients, including individuals, business owners, families and professional service companies. In addition to fiduciary and investment management fee income, we believe these services enable us to build new relationships and expand existing relationships to grow our deposits and loans. Through our wealth management line of business, we offer financial planning, retirement services and trust and investment management for affluent clients as well as clients with more modest resources.  We offer a wide range of investment alternatives, including certificates of deposits, mutual funds, annuities, individual retirement accounts, money market accounts and other financial products.     Territory Served and Competition
 We serve customers and conduct our business from 168 financial centers in 29 South Carolina counties, eight North Carolina counties, 17 Georgia counties and four Virginia counties. We compete in the highly competitive banking and financial services industry. Our profitability depends principally on our ability to effectively compete in the markets in which we conduct business. We expect competition in the industry to continue to increase mainly as a result of the improvement in financial technology used by both existing and new banking and financial services firms. Competition may further intensify as additional companies enter the markets where we conduct business and we enter mature markets in accordance with our expansion strategy.
 We experience strong competition from both bank and non‑bank competitors in certain markets. Broadly speaking, we compete with national banks, super‑regional banks, smaller community banks, non‑traditional internet‑based banks, insurance companies and government sponsored entities. We compete for deposits and loans with commercial banks, credit unions and other non-bank competitors. In addition, we compete with other financial intermediaries and investment alternatives such as mortgage companies, credit card issuers, leasing companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, governmental and corporation bonds, and other securities firms. Many of these non‑bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight, affording them a competitive advantage in some instances. In many cases, our competitors have substantially greater resources and offer certain services that we are unable to provide to our customers.

 We encounter strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with other financial institutions to offer customers competitive interest rates on deposit accounts, competitive interest rates charged on loans and other credit products and reasonable service charges. We believe our customers also consider the quality and scope of the services provided and the convenience of banking facilities. Our customers may also take into account the fact that other banks offer different services from those that we provide. The larger national and super‑regional banks may have significantly greater lending limits and may offer additional products. However, by emphasizing customer service and by providing a wide variety of services, we believe that our Bank has generally been able to compete successfully with our competitors, regardless of their size.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,602 full‑time equivalent employees compared to 2,719 as of the same date in 2017. We consider our relationship with our employees instrumental to the success of our business. We provide many of our employees with a comprehensive employee benefit program which includes the following: group life, health and dental insurance, paid vacation, sick leave, educational opportunities, a cash incentive plan, a stock purchase plan, stock incentive plan for officers and key employees, deferred compensation plans for officers and key employees, a defined benefit pension plan for employees hired on or before December 31, 2005 (except for employees acquired in the SunBank acquisition in November of 2005), and a 401(k) plan with employer match. Regulation and Supervision
 As a financial institution, we operate in a highly regulated environment applicable to bank holding companies and banks and their subsidiaries. Below, we have provided some specific information relevant to the Company. The regulatory framework under which we operate is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (the “FDIC”) Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our security holders and creditors. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. General
 The current regulatory environment for financial institutions includes substantial enforcement activity by the federal banking agencies, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and other state and federal law enforcement agencies. This regulatory environment has associated risks of significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs.
 We are a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and are subject to the supervision of, and to regular inspection by, the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, as a South Carolina bank holding company organized under the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, we are subject to limitations on sale or merger and to regulation by the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions (the “SCBFI”). Our Bank is organized as a South Carolina‑chartered commercial bank. It is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the SCBFI and the FDIC. The following discussion summarizes certain aspects of banking and other laws and regulations that affect the Company and our Bank.
 Under the Bank Holding Company Act (the “BHC Act”), our activities and those of our Bank are limited to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for our Bank, or any other activity which the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHC Act requires prior Federal Reserve Board approval for, among other things, the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all the assets of any bank, or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The BHC Act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company engaged in a non‑banking business unless such business is determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Further, under South Carolina law, it is unlawful without the prior approval of the SCBFI for any South Carolina bank holding company (i) to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank or any other bank holding company, (ii) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or any other bank holding company, or (iii) to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.

 The Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, amended a number of federal banking laws affecting the Company and our Bank. In particular, the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act permits a bank holding company to elect to become a “financial holding company,” provided certain conditions are met. A financial holding company, and the companies it controls, are permitted to engage in activities considered “financial in nature” as defined by the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act and Federal Reserve Board interpretations (including, without limitation, insurance and securities activities), and therefore may engage in a broader range of activities than permitted by bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. 
 Interstate Banking
 Federal legislation permits out-of-state acquisitions by bank holding companies, interstate branching by banks, and interstate merging by banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which was signed into law in July 2010 and is discussed more fully below (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), removed previous state law restrictions on de novo interstate branching in states such as South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. This change effectively permits out‑of‑state banks to open de novo branches in states where the laws of such state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch. 
 Obligations of a Holding Company to its Subsidiary Banks
 A number of obligations and restrictions are imposed by law, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to bank holding companies with regard to their depository institution subsidiaries that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund in the event that the depository institution becomes in danger of defaulting under its obligations to repay deposits. Under a policy of the Federal Reserve Board, which was confirmed in the Dodd‑Frank Act, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), to avoid receivership of its insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become “undercapitalized” within the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.
 The Federal Reserve Board also has the authority under the BHC Act to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve Board’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal law grants federal bank regulatory authorities additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.
 In addition, the “cross guarantee” provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the FDIC as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC’s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.
 The FDIA also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed (after payment of secured claims) to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability, subordinated liability, general creditor or shareholder. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and shareholders in the event a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of our Bank.
 Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s

bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 The Dodd‑Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010 and impacts financial institutions in numerous ways, including:

· | The creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council responsible for monitoring and managing systemic risk,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Granting additional authority to the Federal Reserve to regulate certain types of nonbank financial companies,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Granting new authority to the FDIC as liquidator and receiver,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Changing the manner in which deposit insurance assessments are made,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Requiring regulators to modify capital standards,
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Establishing the CFPB,
--+-----------------------


· | Capping interchange fees that banks with assets of $10 billion or more charge merchants for debit card transactions,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Imposing more stringent requirements on mortgage lenders, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limiting banks’ proprietary trading activities.
--+------------------------------------------------

  There are many provisions in the Dodd‑Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. While many have been issued, some remain to be issued. Governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Basel Capital Standards
 Regulatory capital rules adopted in July 2013 to implement capital standards (which we refer to as the Basel III rules or Basel III), that were generally developed by an international committee known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and adopted as part of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks than those that were previously in place.  The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $3 billion in total consolidated assets.  More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted into the Basel III capital regime. The requirements in the rules as applicable to us began to phase in on January 1, 2015 and were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019.
 Basel III requires higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to us:

· | a common equity Tier 1, which we sometimes refer to as CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  7

 


· | a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Under the rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of instruments that previously qualified before Basel III as Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rules have disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is included only in Tier 2 capital under Basel III; except that the rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in Common Equity Tier 1 capital), subject to certain restrictions.  AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When implemented, Basel III provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI.  We made this opt-out election and, as a result, retained our pre-existing treatment for AOCI.
 In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, under Basel III, a banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The 2.5% capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time, and became fully effective for us on January 1, 2019, resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
 In general, Basel III has had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
 Volcker Rule
 Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule,” generally prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.” Proprietary trading is, in general, trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity’s own account.  Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition include those not required to register with the SEC because they have only qualified purchasers or no more than 100 investors. In December 2013, our primary federal regulators, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, together with other federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2018, the Company has evaluated our securities portfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds. Prompt Corrective Action
 As an insured depository institution, the Bank is required to comply with the capital requirements promulgated under the FDIA and the prompt corrective action regulations thereunder, which set forth five capital categories, each with specific regulatory consequences.  Under these regulations, the categories are: 
· | Well Capitalized — The institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well-capitalized institution (i) has total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adequately Capitalized — The institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. No capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized. An adequately capitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  8

 

greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Undercapitalized — The institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Significantly Undercapitalized — The institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Critically Undercapitalized — The institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If the applicable federal regulator determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the regulator is authorized to reclassify the institution to the next lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.
 If the institution is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. Even if approved, rate restrictions will govern the rate the institution may pay on the brokered deposits. In addition, a bank that is less than well-capitalized generally cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over the “national rate” (as defined below) paid on deposits (including brokered deposits, if approval is granted for the bank to accept them) of comparable size and maturity. The “national rate” is defined as a simple average of rates paid by insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available and is published weekly by the FDIC. Institutions subject to the restrictions that believe they are operating in an area where the rates paid on deposits are higher than the “national rate” can use the local market to determine the prevailing rate if they seek and receive a determination from the FDIC that it is operating in a high‑rate area. Regardless of the determination, institutions must use the national rate to determine conformance for all deposits outside their market area.
 Moreover, if the institution becomes less than adequately capitalized, it must adopt a capital restoration plan acceptable to the FDIC. The institution also would become subject to increased regulatory oversight, and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. Each company having control over an undercapitalized institution also must provide a limited guarantee that the institution will comply with its capital restoration plan. Except under limited circumstances consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, an undercapitalized institution may not grow. An undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution, establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless it is determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, or unless the FDIC determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action. The appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities.
 An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution, that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized.  
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was deemed to be “well capitalized.”

 Payment of Dividends
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company generally should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders are derived primarily from dividends received from our Bank. Our Bank is subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends. Any restriction on the ability of our Bank to pay dividends will indirectly restrict the ability of the Company to pay dividends.
 The Company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from the Bank. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its subsidiary to transfer funds to the Company in form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The approval of the SCBFI is required to pay dividends that exceeds 100% of net income in any calendar year. The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current earnings.
 The ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends may also be affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non‑capital standards established under the FDICIA, as described above. The right of the Company, its shareholders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiary is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of our Bank.
 Certain Transactions by the Company and its Affiliates
 Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company or its non‑bank subsidiaries. The Company and the Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W. 
 Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to any affiliate, including the holding company, and on a bank’s investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations any of affiliates of the bank. Section 23A also applies to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank is forbidden to purchase low quality assets from an affiliate.
 Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies. If there are no comparable transactions, a bank’s (or one of its subsidiaries’) affiliate transaction must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies. These requirements apply to all transactions subject to Section 23A as well as to certain other transactions.
 The affiliates of a bank include any holding company of the bank, any other company under common control with the bank (including any company controlled by the same shareholders who control the bank), any subsidiary of the bank that is itself a bank, any company in which the majority of the directors or trustees also constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or holding company of the bank, any company sponsored and advised on a contractual basis by the bank or an affiliate, and any mutual fund advised by a bank or any of the bank’s affiliates.  Regulation W generally excludes all non‑bank and non‑savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve Board decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.

 The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit include derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that such transactions cause a bank to have credit exposure to an insider. Any extension of credit to an insider: must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties; and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 Insurance of Deposits
 The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Dodd‑Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings associations and credit unions to $250,000 per account. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund.
 As an FDIC-insured bank, the Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity.  The Bank’s assessment rates are currently based on its risk classification (i.e., the level of risk it poses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund), and institutions classified as higher risk pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk.  Banks with assets of $10 billion or more (after achieving such asset threshold for four consecutive quarters) are subject to a deposit assessment based on a “scorecard” system that combines regulatory ratings and certain forward‑looking financial measures intended to assess the risk an institution poses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund. Because the Bank exceeded $10 billion in assets on January 3, 2017 through the merger with SBFC, the Bank’s deposit insurance assessment became based on this scorecard system starting in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted in an increase in the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance.  The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations.  
 In addition to the ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances.  For example, the FDIC has raised assessment rates and imposed special assessments on certain institutions during recent years to raise funds. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund was increased to 1.35% (which ratio was required to be reached by September 30, 2020) of the estimated total amount of insured deposits.  In March 2016, the FDIC adopted rules to impose a surcharge, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions that are deemed under the rules to be “large institutions,” generally defined to include banks with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more for four consecutive quarters, with the first $10 billion being subtracted from the regular insurance assessment base and certain other potential adjustments being made to determine the surcharge base.  The large institution surcharge became effective on July 1, 2016, and on September 30, 2018, the deposit insurance fund reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%.  Accordingly, the last quarterly surcharge was reflected in large institutions’ December 2018 assessment invoices, which covered the assessment period from July 1 through September 30.  FDIC regulations provided for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%:  (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large institutions) will cease; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%.  The Company preliminarily received an estimate from the FDIC that it would receive an assessment credit of approximately $2.4 million based upon the bank being considered a small bank from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 along with the assessment credits earned by SBFC and PSC before they merged with and into the Company in 2017.  Assessment rates are expected to decrease if the reserve ratio increases such that it exceeds 2%.
 In addition, FDIC insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s.  These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of deposits, will continue as the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019.  The amount assessed on individual institutions is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules.  Assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base.
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a notice and hearing that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to 

 
  11

 
continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, remain insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 Incentive Compensation
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Company and the Bank, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011. However, the 2011 proposal was replaced with a new proposal in May 2016, which makes explicit that the involvement of risk management and control personnel includes not only compliance, risk management and internal audit, but also legal, human resources, accounting, financial reporting and finance roles responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring or controlling risk-taking. A final rule had not been adopted as of December 31, 2018.
 In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk‑taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk‑taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
 The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk‑focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk‑management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 Anti‑Tying Restrictions
 Under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that:

· | the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank, the bank holding company or its subsidiaries; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the customer not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Certain arrangements are permissible: a bank may offer combined‑balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products; and certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. A bank holding company or any bank affiliate also is subject to anti‑tying requirements in connection with electronic benefit transfer services.

 Community Reinvestment Act
 The Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) requires a financial institution’s primary regulator, which is the FDIC for the Bank, to evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on the institution. Additionally, the institution must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA‑related agreements. In its most recent CRA examination, the Bank received a “satisfactory” rating. Consumer Protection Regulations
 Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The loan operations of the Bank are also subject to federal laws and regulations applicable to credit transactions, such as:
· | the Dodd‑Frank Act that created the CFPB within the Federal Reserve Board, which has broad rule‑making authority over a wide range of consumer laws that apply to all insured depository institutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Truth‑In‑Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers and including substantial new requirements for mortgage lending, as mandated by the Dodd‑Frank Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and Regulation V, as well as the rules and regulations of the FDIC, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections and certain credit and other disclosures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, which governs aspects of the settlement process for residential mortgage loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2018 which mandates a nationwide licensing and registration system for residential mortgage loan originators. The act also prohibits individuals from engaging in the business of a residential mortgage loan originator with first obtaining and maintaining annually registration as either a federal or state licensed mortgage loan originator; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Mortgages Acts and Practices – Advertising (Regulation N) prohibits any person from making any material misrepresentation in connection with an advertisement for any mortgage credit product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The deposit operations of the Bank are also subject to federal laws, such as:

· | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  13

 


· | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires depository institutions to provide disclosures so that consumers can make meaningful comparisons about depository institutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Heightened Requirements for Bank Holding Companies with $10 Billion or More in Assets 
 Various federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies. Most of these rules apply primarily to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain rules also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The Company exceeded $10 billion in total consolidated assets upon consummation of our merger with SBFC on January 3, 2017.  Starting in the second quarter of 2018 (subject to any applicable phase-in period), the fourth consecutive quarter in which our total consolidated assets exceeded $10 billion, we became subject to, among other requirements, the following:   
· | Establish a Risk Committee. As a publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets, we must comply with certain provisions of the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards. For instance, we are required to establish, and have established, a dedicated risk committee of our board of directors responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk management policies, which must be commensurate with our capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors, and including as a member at least one risk management expert; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Durbin Amendment. Beginning on July 1, 2018, we became subject to the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act relating to debit card interchange fees, called “swipe fees.” Under the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulations, bank issuers who are not exempt may only receive an interchange fee from merchants that is reasonable and proportional to the cost of clearing the transaction. The maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. A debit card issuer may also recover $0.01 per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. See further discussion in Management Discussion & Analysis under the noninterest income subsection on page 57. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CFPB Examination. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, such as the Bank. Depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, which may increase their compliance risk and the costs associated with their compliance efforts, but these banks will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Company and the Bank are now subject to examination by the CFPB. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a 

 
  14

 
“qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The CFPB has opened inquiries into whether additional rulemaking would be appropriate for overdraft protection programs. 
 The CFPB has issued a number of regulations related to the origination of mortgages, foreclosures, and overdrafts as well as many other consumer issues. Additionally, the CFPB has proposed, or will be proposing, additional regulations on issues that directly relate to our business. Although it is difficult to predict at this time the extent to which the CFPB’s final rules impact the operations and financial condition of the banks, such rules may have a material impact on our compliance costs, compliance risk and fee income.
 Enforcement Powers
 The Bank and its “institution‑affiliated parties,” including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, and consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. These practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the filing of false or misleading information or the submission of inaccurate reports. Potential civil penalties have been substantially increased. Criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes have been increased to 20 years.
 In addition, regulators are provided with considerable flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution‑affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance. Furthermore, banking agencies’ have expansive power to issue cease‑and‑desist orders. These orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate.
 The number of government entities authorized to take action against the Bank has expanded under the Dodd‑Frank Act. The FDIC continues to have primary federal enforcement authority, and the SCBFI also has enforcement authority, with respect to the Bank. In addition, as noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.  Financial institutions with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
 Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions or other proceedings under the Dodd‑Frank Act or regulations against state‑chartered banks, including the Bank. Prior notice to the CFPB and the FDIC would be necessary for an action against the Bank.
 Anti‑Money Laundering
 Financial institutions must maintain anti‑money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and “knowing your customer” in their dealings with foreign financial institutions, foreign customers and other high risk customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti‑money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”), enacted in 2001 and renewed through 2015, as described below. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and this area has become a particular focus of the regulators in recent years. In addition, the regulators are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. The regulatory authorities have been active in imposing “cease and desist” orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.

 USA PATRIOT Act
 The Patriot Act became effective on October 26, 2001 and amended the Bank Secrecy Act. The Patriot Act provides, in part, for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti‑money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including:
· | requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | filing suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Patriot Act requires financial institutions to undertake enhanced due diligence of private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non‑U.S. persons that they administer, maintain, or manage. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
 Under the Patriot Act, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) can send the Bank a list of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or money laundering. The Bank may be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on the list. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must report those relationships or transactions to FinCEN.
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which is an office in the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts; owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of target countries, and narcotics traffickers. If a bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze or block the transactions on the account. The Bank has appointed a compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. The Bank actively checks high‑risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. These checks are performed using software that is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Privacy and Credit Reporting
 Financial institutions are required through Regulation P to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. The Bank’s policy is not to disclose any personal information unless permitted by law.
 Like other lending institutions, the Bank uses credit bureau data in its underwriting activities. Use of that data is regulated under the Federal Credit Reporting Act on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, sharing of information between affiliates, and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 allows states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of the act.

 Fiscal and Monetary Policy
 Banking is a business that depends largely on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest we pay on our deposits and other borrowings, and the interest we receive on our loans and securities holdings, constitutes the major portion of our bank’s earnings. Thus, our earnings and growth will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates, among other things, the supply of money through various means, including open‑market dealings in United States government securities, the discount rate at which banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Board, and the reserve requirements on deposits. We cannot predict the nature and timing of any changes in such policies and their impact on our business. Commercial Real Estate Guidance
 In December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a statement entitled “Interagency Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “CRE Guidance”).  In the CRE Guidance, the federal banking regulators (i) expressed concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, (ii) directed financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and (iii) indicated that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward.  The federal banking regulators previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled “Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices,” which stated that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where (1) total commercial real estate loans (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300% or more of its total capital and (2) the outstanding balance of such institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio  (excluding loans secured by owner occupied properties) has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.  As of December 31, 2018, aggregate non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans as a percentage of its total capital was 216%.  Over the past 36 months, the aggregate non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by more than 50% due mostly through our acquisitions in 2017. Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action
 New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide‑ranging provisions for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation’s financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Executive Officers of South State Corporation
 Executive officers of South State Corporation are elected by the board of directors annually and serve at the pleasure of the board of directors. The executive officer, and persons chosen to become executive officers, and their ages, positions over the past five years, and terms of office as of February 17, 2019, are as follows:
