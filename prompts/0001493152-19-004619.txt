The Company
 
Overview
 
We are a mining company that was formed in Nevada on July 2, 2007. As a mining company, we are engaged in the production of precious metals. Our activities are not limited to production and they also include production, acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties, primarily for gold, from owned mining properties. Inception Mining has acquired two projects, the UP and Burlington mine and the Clavo Rico mine, as further described below. Our target properties are those that have been the subject of historical exploration. We have generated revenue and are generating revenue from mining operations.
 
UP and Burlington Gold Mine
 
On February 25, 2013, the Company acquired certain real property and the associated exploration permits and mineral rights commonly known as the UP and Burlington Gold Mine (“UP and Burlington” or the “Mine”) pursuant to that certain asset purchase agreement entered between the Company, its majority shareholder (the “Majority Shareholder”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inception Development Inc. (the “Subsidiary”) on one hand, and Inception Resources on the other hand, dated February 25, 2013 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). Accordingly, the Company owns and controls this property exclusively; there are no third parties who impose conditions of any kind on operations at this location. We are presently in the exploration stage at UP and Burlington. UP and Burlington contain two federal patented mining claims which Inception Resources acquired for the purpose of the exploration and potential development of gold on the 40 acres which comprises UP and Burlington. Production at this mine is subject to a 3% net smelter royalty, which may increase or decrease depending on the amount of gold produced.
 
Discovered in 1892, UP and Burlington is a private gold property that has been held unused in a family trust for the past 75 years. UP and Burlington is located in Lemhi County, Northwest of Salmon, Idaho, at an elevation of 7,994 feet. The UP and Burlington site is located six miles from the city of Salmon; is 0.6 miles away from the closest major road (Ridge Rd.); and is 1.56 miles away from the closest major power line. We believe Salmon, along with the surrounding County of Lemhi, provides an excellent infrastructure for our mine. Salmon has a population of 3,122 and Lemhi County has a population of 7,806. In September 2011, heavy maintenance and right-of-way repair was completed and a new road to UP and Burlington was constructed.

UP and Burlington’s two gold mining claims were brought to patent in 1900, which covers the Mine’s 40 acres. Subsequently, in 1989, a U.S. Forest Survey was performed on the UP and Burlington site confirming that the patented claims cover an area which is six hundred feet by three thousand feet (600‘x3000’). The Mine’s patented claims remove the challenges associated when working on U.S. Forest lands, Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), state or other property types. With our purchase of UP and Burlington, we have the benefit of working on private land, which requires only a hauling / road permit to commence significant operations.
 
The Company has obtained the necessary permitting, cut additional access roads, made surface improvements, and initiated surface mining on a 2,500 foot per day lighted vein for bulk sampling, vein definition and ore valuation. In Phase II, we plan to contract an underground mining and operations plan, expand portal development leveraging existing underground access, and implement underground mining to a depth based on optimizing costs versus processed ore value. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing any stage of our plans.
 
Our plan includes the continuation of obtaining a Lemhi County Conditional Use Permit and an Idaho Department of Lands Surface Reclamation Bond. Since receiving the permitting for the U.S. Forest Service Access Road, the access road is now complete. In addition, we have contracts such as geotechnical contracts, mining contracts, toll processing contracts, and underground mine plan contracts.
 
The Company and its independent consultants are in the process of developing a detailed exploration-drilling program to confirm and expand mineralized zones in the Mine and collect additional environmental and technical data. The first phase began in 2013. The Company intends to continue drilling, metallurgical testing, engineering and environmental programs and studies and has updated the historic feasibility study and environmental permit applications.
 
We also plan to review opportunities and acquire additional mineral properties with current or historic precious and base metal mineralization with meaningful exploration potential.
 
Clavo Rico Mine
 
On October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger with Clavo Rico Ltd. (“Clavo Rico”). Clavo Rico is a privately held Turks and Caicos company with principal operations in Honduras, Central America. Clavo Rico operates the Clavo Rico mining concession through its subsidiaries Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and Compañía Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V. and holds other mining concessions. Its workings include several historical underground mining operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation.
 
The Company’s primary mine is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern Honduras. This mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the Spanish, and more recently has been operated by Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S. de R.L. as a small family business. In 2003, Clavo Rico’s predecessor purchased a 20% interest and later increased its ownership to 99.9%. This company has since invested over five million dollars in the expansion and development of the mine and surrounding properties. Today, the Company operates this mine through exploration of surface-level material.
 
Mining operations begin by crushing extracted material to approximately 3/8-inch size pebbles, which is then mixed with additional material and loaded on the recovery pad for processing. The pebble material is sprinkled with a solution that leaches the gold from the rock, and the solution is collected and processed on-site at Clavo Rico’s own ADR plant. The doré bars that result from this process are shipped to the USA for refining.
 
Prior to the expansion, the mine had only been processing approximately less than 500 tons of extracted material per day. The current recovery operational increase has been sized to handle from 500 to 750 tons of extracted material per day on a recovery bed that has the capacity to receive up to 750,000 tons of material. The Company commenced full operations on January 1, 2012 and believes that sufficiently high gold content ore bodies have been located and blocked out to load the leach pad to capacity by the end of June 30, 2020.

The Company has engaged in preliminary drilling of this area and the resulting assays of samples indicate that the material should have grades in the range of 0-5 grams of gold per ton.
 
Competition and Mineral Prices
 
We compete with many companies in the mining business, including larger, more established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease or acquisition in the United States and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. Because we compete with individuals and companies that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring desirable mineral properties. From time to time, specific properties or areas that would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition are unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. Competition in the mining industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital needed to fund the acquisition and operation of such properties. Competition may result in our company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees, to obtain equipment and personnel to assist in our exploration activities or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and business. The mineral exploration industry is highly fragmented, and we are a very small participant in this sector. Many of our competitors explore for a variety of minerals and control many different properties around the world. Many of them have been in business longer than we have and have established strategic partnerships and relationships and have greater financial resources than we do.
 
There is significant competition for properties suitable for gold exploration. As a result, we may be unable to continue to acquire interests in attractive properties on terms that we consider acceptable. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as dynamite, and certain equipment such as drill rigs, bulldozers and excavators that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.
 
Market for Gold
 
Wholesale purchasers for the gold we mine are readily available, as many purchasers of precious metals exist in the United States and abroad. Among the largest are Handy & Harman, Engelhard Industries and Johnson Matthey, Ltd. Historically, these markets are liquid and volatile. Wholesale purchase prices for precious metals can be affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to:

● | fluctuation in the supply of, demand, and market price for gold; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | mining activities of our competitors; 
● | sale or purchase of gold by central banks and for investment purposes by individuals and financial institutions; 
● | interest rates; 
● | currency exchange rates; 
● | inflation or deflation; 
● | fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and other currencies; and 
● | political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineral-producing countries. 

 
If we find gold that is deemed of economic grade and in sufficient quantities to justify removal, we may seek additional capital through equity or debt financing to build a mine and processing facility, or enter into joint venture or other arrangements with large and more experienced companies better able to fund ongoing exploration and development work, or find some other entity to mine our property on our behalf, or sell or lease our rights to mine the gold. Upon mining, the ore would be processed through a series of steps that produces a rough concentrate. This rough concentrate is then sold to refiners and smelters for the value of the minerals that it contains, less the cost of further concentrating, refining and smelting. Refiners and smelters then sell the gold on the open market through brokers who work for wholesalers including the major wholesalers listed above.

Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Mining Operations
 
UP and BURLINGTON (Lemhi County, Idaho)
 
The mine operations in Idaho are governed by both federal and state law. We are required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally. Federal laws, such as those governing the purchase, transport or storage of explosives, and those governing mine safety and health, also apply. The Company plans to obtain a Lemhi County Conditional Use Permit, an Idaho Department of Lands Surface Reclamation Bond and permitting for the U.S. Forest Service Access Road.
 
When this mine comes into production, we will also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, a Division of the United States Department of Labor.
 
CLAVO RICO (Honduras, Central America)
 
The mining operations in Honduras are governed by the national entities Honduran Institute of Geology and Mines (INHGEOMIN) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA). The Clavo Rico mine has operated under a grandfathered concession granted many years ago and has now complied with all regulatory requirements of the above agencies and the recently adopted Honduran Mining laws (The General Mining Law was approved by Legislative Decree No. 238-2012, dated January 23, 2013), including employee health and safety regulations, Environmental requirements, water discharge requirements, and potential reclamation requirements. As the above ministries have only limited operational experience and the new mining law has only recently been adopted, the interpretation, adoption and enforcement of many regulations are evolving. Other local ordinances (municipality of El Corpus) minor and most regulatory efforts are as a result of interaction between the mine and the local populace, (examples include use of the mine haul road for local traffic, restricting mine operations to daylight hours for noise considerations, watering for dust control, etc.) where no regulation or law exists, we have attempted to duplicate best practices as required in other business climates.
 
These laws and regulations are continually changing and, as a general matter, are becoming more restrictive. The Company’s policy is to conduct our business in a manner that safeguards public health and mitigates the environmental effects of our business activities. To comply with these laws and regulations, we have made, and in the future may be required to make, capital and operating expenditures.
 
Environmental Laws
 
Mining activities at the Company’s properties are also subject to various environmental laws, both federal and state, including but not limited to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, CERCLA (as defined below), the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, and certain Idaho state laws governing the discharge of pollutants and the use and discharge of water. Various permits from federal and state agencies are required under many of these laws. Local laws and ordinances may also apply to such activities as construction of facilities, land use, waste disposal, road use and noise levels.

To comply with these laws and regulations, we have made, and in the future may be required to make, capital and operating expenditures.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), imposes strict, joint, and several liabilities on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances. Liable parties include, among others, the current owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed or released into the environment and past owners and operators of properties who owned such properties at the time of such disposal or release. This liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damages to natural resources. Our properties, because of past mining activities, could give rise to potential liability under CERCLA.

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and related state laws, mining companies may incur costs for generating, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous or solid wastes associated with certain mining-related activities. RCRA costs may also include corrective action or cleanup costs.
 
Mining operations may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants, from stationary equipment, such as crushers and storage facilities, and from mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment. All of these sources are subject to review, monitoring, permitting, and/or control requirements under the federal Clean Air Act and related state air quality laws. Air quality permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the permitting conditions.
 
Under the federal Clean Water Act and the delegated Colorado water-quality program, point-source discharges into waters of the State are regulated by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. Storm water discharges also are regulated and permitted under that statute. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of dredge and fill material into Waters of the United States, including wetlands. All of those programs may impose permitting and other requirements on our operations.
 
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires an assessment of the environmental impacts of major federal actions. The federal action requirement must be satisfied if the project involves federal land or if the federal government provides financing or permitting approvals. NEPA does not establish any substantive standards, but requires the analysis of any potential impacts. The scope of the assessment process depends on the size of the project. An Environmental Assessment (EA) may be adequate for smaller projects. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which is much more detailed and broader in scope than an EA, is required for larger projects. NEPA compliance requirements for any of our proposed projects could result in additional costs or delays.
 
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Department of Interior. The purpose of the ESA is to conserve and recover listed endangered and threatened species and their habitat. Under the ESA, endangered means that a species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term threatened under such statute means that a species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. Under the ESA, it is unlawful to take a listed species, which can include harassing or harming members of such species or significantly modifying their habitat. Future identification of endangered species or habitat in our project areas may delay or adversely affect our operations.
 
U.S. federal and state reclamation requirements often mandate concurrent reclamation and require permitting in addition to the posting of reclamation bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurance sufficient to guarantee the cost of reclamation. If reclamation obligations are not met, the designated agency could draw on these bonds or letters of credit to fund expenditures for reclamation requirements. Reclamation requirements generally include stabilizing, contouring and re-vegetating disturbed lands, controlling drainage from portals and waste rock dumps, removing roads and structures, neutralizing or removing process solutions, monitoring groundwater at the mining site, and maintaining visual aesthetics.
 
Capital Equipment and Research & Development Expenditures
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not incur any expense related to research and development. Additionally, we are not currently conducting any research and development activities other than those relating to the possible acquisition of new gold and/or silver properties or projects of which there is no guarantee. As we proceed with our exploration programs, we may need to engage additional contractors and consider the possibility of adding additional permanent employees, as well as the possible purchase or lease of equipment.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, we currently employ ninety-nine (99) full-time employees and generally around twelve (12) temporary employees in the United States and Honduras. We have contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including investor relations, exploration, development, permitting, and other administrative functions, and may staff further with employees as we expand activities and bring new projects on line.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
We do not currently own any patents or trademarks. Also, we are not a party to any license or franchise agreements, concessions, or labor contracts arising from any patents or trademarks. As part of our purchase of UP and Burlington, we granted a net smelter royalty (“NSR”) of 3% of production in the UP and Burlington mine. Additionally, our Clavo Rico project has a NSR of 5% in addition to a refinery royalty of 3% of production in the Clavo Rico mine.
