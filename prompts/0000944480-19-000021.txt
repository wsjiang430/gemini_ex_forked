 Business Strategy, Industry Trends, Products and Services
 Business Strategy
 Our objective is to create a leading specialty engineering, expert staffing and technology delivery platform focused primarily on the nuclear power industry. We offer our differentiated suite of products and services to adjacent markets such as the fossil power and process industries where our offerings are a natural fit, delivering a clear and compelling value proposition to the market. Our primary growth strategy is twofold: (1) seek acquisitions to accelerate our overall growth in a manner that is complementary to our core business and (2) expand organically within our core markets by leveraging our market leadership position and drive increased usage and product adoption via new products and services. To accomplish this objective, we will pursue the following activities:
 - Pursue roll-up acquisition strategy. We intend to complement our organic growth strategy through selective acquisitions including, but not limited to, the following: engineering; training, staffing and consulting service businesses for the power industry, with a particular focus on nuclear power; and software utilized in the power industry, both domestic and international. We are focusing our efforts on acquisitions that would enhance our existing portfolio of products and services, strengthen our relationships with our existing customers, and potentially expand our footprint to include new customers in our core served industries. We have made three acquisitions since 2017 and believe the opportunity exists to acquire more businesses that are complementary to ours, allowing us to accelerate our growth strategy.
 
In February 2019, we acquired DP Engineering, a specialized provider of high-value engineering services and solutions to the nuclear power industry. In May 2018, we acquired True North, a leading provider of specialty engineering solutions to the nuclear power industry and in September 2017, we acquired Absolute, a provider of technical consulting and staffing solutions to the global nuclear power industry. The acquisitions of Absolute, True North and DP Engineering are expected to strengthen the Company's global leadership in the nuclear services area. The acquisitions added new capabilities to the GSE solution offering and bring new highly complementary customers to GSE, while at the same time deepening GSE relationships with existing clients. These acquisitions, together with our earlier acquisition of Hyperspring in November 2014, are a significant proof point of the thesis that GSE is a compelling platform for consolidating a fragmented vendor ecosystem for nuclear power. We believe the acquisitions add significant scale and focus to the business, while positioning GSE as a "go to" provider of technical and consulting solutions to the power industry, in particular nuclear power.
 - Expand our total addressable market. Our focus on growth means introducing product capabilities or new product and service categories that create value for our customers and therefore expand our total addressable market. Currently we are working on initiatives to expand our solution offerings in both of our business segments that may include, but not be limited to, the following: expanding our software product portfolio to  include enhanced power and process simulation tools and systems that are complementary to our core offerings; delivering enhanced learning management systems/solutions; offering fully outsourced training solutions to our customers; adding work flow process improvement solutions; tailoring operational reporting and business intelligence solutions to address the unique need of our end user markets; and adding new services to broaden our market reach.
 Initiatives such as these will broaden our scope and enable us to engage more deeply with the segments we serve and adjacent segments. We have delivered a compelling solution, the GSE GPWRTM Generic Pressurized Water Reactor simulation technology, proving that our modeling technology can be sold in generic form via traditional license terms and conditions to the nuclear industry ecosystem. We have both upgraded and expanded the EnVision™ library of simulation and eLearning tutorials for the process industries with specific new products for training clients in the upstream segment of the oil and gas industry including launching a new cloud-based training platform, EnVision™ Learning On-Demand, that significantly extends the capabilities of its industry leading EnVision™ tutorials and simulations. We continue to provide cutting edge training systems by adapting our technology to systems that meet the specific needs of customers such as U.S. government laboratories.
 - Research and development (R&D). We invest in R&D to deliver unique solutions that add value to our end-user markets. We have delivered nuclear core and Balance-of-Plant modeling and visualization systems to the industry. To address the nuclear industry's need for more accurate simulation of both normal and accident scenarios, we provide our DesignEP® and RELAP5-HD® solutions. Our entire JADETM suite of simulation software, including industry leading JTOPMERET® and JElectricTM software, provides the most accurate simulation of Balance-of-Plant and electrical systems available to the nuclear and fossil plant simulation market. The significant enhancements we have made to our SimExec® and OpenSimTM platforms enables customers to be more efficient in the daily operation of their simulators. We are bringing SimExec® and OpenSimTM together into a next generation unified environment that will add new capabilities as requested by clients and driven by market need.
 We intend to continue to make pragmatic and measured investments in R&D that first and foremost are driven by the market and complement our growth strategy. Such investments in R&D may result in on-going enhancement of existing solutions as well as the creation of new solutions to serve our target markets, ensuring that we add greater value that is easier to use, at lower total cost of ownership than any alternative available to customers. GSE has pioneered a number of industry standards and intends to continue to be one of the most innovative companies in our industry. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have made R&D investments totaling $1.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

Industry Trends
 - Industry need to build and sustain a highly skilled workforce
 We believe a critical ongoing challenge facing the industries we serve is access to, and continued development of, a highly trained and efficient workforce. This challenge manifests primarily in two ways: the increasing pace at which industry knowledge and experience are lost as a significant percentage of the existing experienced workforce reaches retirement age; and the fact that as new power plants come on-line, there is an increased demand for workers to staff and operate those plants.
 In the United States, the energy industry is expected to lose a large percentage of its workforce within the next few years as baby boomers retire on the traditional schedule. For example, Power Engineering reported that the power sector needs more than 100,000 skilled workers within the next few years to replace retiring baby boomers.  Electric, Light, and Power reported that 72% of energy employers currently struggle to find quality candidates and fill open positions.  The National Electrical Contractors Association reported that 7,000 electricians join the field each year, while 10,000 retire. Finally, the Nuclear Energy Institute estimated that 39% of the nuclear workforce were eligible to retire in the next few years. As the nuclear industry expands and modernizes its fleet and strains to maintain the high standards of training for the existing workforce, existing plant simulator systems, which provide a critical environment for training services, are often operating 24 hours a day. With workers retiring and the need to backfill as well as expand the workforce for new units, certain operators are exploring the opportunity to de-bottleneck their existing simulator capabilities through the creation of dual reference simulators. Other workforce shortages and/or short-term spikes in demand for specialist skills that we offer similarly are positive developments for our business.
 Globally, as more people increase their standard of living, their demand for power will increase, which in turn will require continuing construction of power plants to meet this surging demand. Developing a skilled labor force to operate these plants and keeping their skills current and their certifications in compliance with regulatory requirements is a key challenge facing the global power industry.
 - Status of nuclear power in 2017/2018
 The world’s nuclear reactors performed well in 2017 (the most recent full year for which data is available). Global nuclear electricity output was 2506 terawatt-hour (TWh), an increase of 29 TWh compared to 2016. This marked the fifth successive year that nuclear output has increased, with generation 160 TWh higher than in 2012.
 At the end of 2017 the global nuclear capacity of 448 operable reactors stood at 392 GWh, up 2 GWe on the end of 2016 total. Four new reactors were connected to the grid, with a combined capacity of 3373 MWe. Five reactors were shut down, with a combined capacity of 3025 MWe.  Two of those reactors, Monju and Santa Maria de Garoña, had not generated for some years previously, however.
 The number of reactors under construction at the end of 2017 was 59. The median average construction time for the four reactors grid connected in 2017 was 58 months. In addition to the four grid connections, there were four construction starts and two construction projects halted. Both 2015 and 2016 had more grid connections, with ten each, and there were more grid connections in 2018 than in 2017.
 The capacity factor for the global fleet stood at 81%, maintaining the high availability of around 80% that has been maintained since 2000, up from the 60% average capacity factor at the start of the 1980s.
 In Asia, construction started on the first nuclear power reactor to be built in Bangladesh.  Nuclear generation was boosted by the return to service of the fifth Japanese reactor, with further restarts taking place in 2018.  In South Korea, a public vote lead to the resumption of construction of Shin-Kori 5. Construction was completed on the first unit at Barakah, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
 In Canada, plans are progressing to support the development of small modular reactor (SMR) technology, as well as to ensure the continued operation of its existing Candu reactors.
 In the US, construction was halted on the two VC Summer reactors, but agreement was reached on the completion of the two sister reactors at Vogtle plant. In some states, measures have been introduced to correct market distortions to support the continued operation of nuclear plants providing reliable and clean electricity.
 Turkey has become the latest country to start a new build program. Construction on-site at Akkuyu formally started in December 2017, with construction of the first reactor starting in April 2018.  Progress is underway, evidenced by the construction of more than 25 reactors scheduled to be completed in 2018 and 2019. New reactor projects are needed to maintain and accelerate global nuclear build so that nuclear generation can achieve the Harmony goal of supplying 25% of the world’s global electricity by 2050.
 A two-year budget deal signed by President Donald Trump on February 9, 2018, includes provisions that will benefit the development of nuclear power in the U.S. including the expansion of Vogtle, which is located near Waynesboro, GA. The Nuclear Energy Institute said that the legislation signed: (1) allows for new nuclear reactors placed in service after December 31, 2020, to qualify for the nuclear PTC; (2) permits the Secretary of Energy to allocate credits up to a 6,000-megawatt capacity limit for the first “new nuclear” reactors placed in service after December 31, 2020; and (3) allows public-entity project partners to transfer their credits to other project partners.
 NEI said that the deadline change will ensure the two reactors being built at Vogtle will benefit from the PTC and that the 6,000-MW capacity limit indicates the PTC will also benefit NuScale Power LLC’s and its partners’ plans to build its first commercial power plant at the Idaho National Laboratory by 2026.
 For the existing U.S. nuclear fleet, there is recognition that these plants are essential to meeting national goals of reducing carbon emissions, even as renewable energy sources are introduced. This recognition of the importance of nuclear power in providing zero-carbon baseload is demonstrated by the state of New York's Clean Energy Standard that values the emission-free energy of New York's nuclear fleet by granting a subsidy of 1.7¢/kWh. This subsidy helps ensure the state's existing nuclear plants remain economically viable in an era of low-cost natural gas, even competing with wind and solar power generation sources receiving a subsidy of 4.5¢/kWh.
 In addition, the Illinois Legislature on December 2, 2016, passed the Future Energy Jobs Bill on December 2, 2016, a measure that ensures the continued operation of the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear power plants in that state. In a statement, the Nuclear Energy Institute said the bill’s passage was a “remarkable moment” for the state and the nuclear industry. Gov. Bruce Rauner signed the bill into law on December 7, 2016. The Future Energy Jobs Bill provides Exelon and Commonwealth Edison with a $235 million annual credit for the carbon-free energy produced by the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants.
 At the end of October 2017, Connecticut passed a bill that may help it keep its Millstone nuclear plant open. The bill permits state energy officials to change the rules for how Dominion Nuclear Connecticut sells electricity from Millstone.  Millstone could sell up to 75% of its output in competition with the other zero-carbon sources of electricity under the bill.  This is a significant recognition of the strategic value that nuclear power provides via zero-carbon baseload.
 On May 22, 2018, New Jersey passed a bill establishing a Zero Emissions Certificate (ZEC) program to maintain New Jersey’s nuclear energy supply, which contributes close to 40 percent of the state’s electric capacity and is by far its largest source of carbon free energy. Plants seeking to participate in the program would be required, among other things, to demonstrate that they make a significant contribution to New Jersey air quality and are at risk of closure within three years. The four reactors operating in New Jersey are capable of generating over 4,100 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Three are located at the Salem-Hope Creek nuclear plant and are operated by a unit of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., the state’s biggest power company.
 The actions of New York, Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey represent a trend that may continue as states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania consider legislation to recognize the value of zero-carbon power produced by nuclear plants in those states. This would echo the rollout of the Renewable Portfolio Standard across more than half of the states in the US to recognize the benefits of zero-carbon renewable power.
 In regulated markets where the economy is growing, the nuclear fleet is profitable and expanding, with two reactors under construction in the southeast U.S.  Longer term, the trends for nuclear power have promise as small-scale modular reactors (SMR's) advance in development and prototyping.  A project is planned to build a NuScale Power SMR at Idaho National Labs. NuScale Power is a long-standing GSE customer. Tennessee Valley Authority submitted an application for an early site permit for two or more SMRs modules (up to 800 MWe, 2420 MWt) at the Clinch River Nuclear site on May 12, 2016.  In January 2017 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission accepted and docketed the early site permit.  U.S. Department of Energy recently released a draft plan to double America's nuclear power capacity by 2050.  The plan, dubbed "Vision 2050", promotes expanding America's nuclear capacity through advanced reactor designs including small and medium-size reactors.
 We believe GSE is well positioned to take full advantage of these strategic global and domestic trends by providing high fidelity simulation and training solutions to the global power and process industries.

 To assist our clients in creating world-class internal training and engineering improvement processes, we offer a set of integrated and scalable products and services that provide a structured program focused on continuous skills improvement for experienced employees to engineering services, including plant design verification and validation, ASME code compliance, and design plant modification work. We provide the right solutions to solve our clients' most pressing needs.
 For workforce development and training, students and instructors alike must have a high degree of confidence that their power plant simulator truly reflects plant behavior across the entire range of operations. To earn this confidence, GSE's simulation solution starts with the most robust engineering approach possible. Using state-of-the-art modeling tools combined with our leading nuclear power modeling expertise, GSE provides simulation solutions that achieve unparalleled fidelity and accuracy. The solutions that GSE provides are also known for ease of use, resulting in increased productivity for end-users. For these reasons, GSE has delivered more nuclear power plant simulators than any other company in the world.
 For virtual commissioning, designers of first-of-a-kind plants or existing plants need a highly accurate dynamic simulation platform to model a wide variety of design assumptions and concepts from control strategies to plant behavior to human factors. Because new builds and upgrades to existing plants result in deployment of new technology, often involving the integration of disparate technologies for the first time, a high-fidelity simulator enables designers to model the interaction between systems in advance of construction. With our combination of simulation technology and expert engineering, GSE was chosen to build first-of-a-kind simulators for the AP1000, PBMR, and small modular reactors such as those being built by NuScale.
 Examples of the types of simulators we sell include, but are not limited to, the following:
   
● | Universal Training Simulators: These products complement our Self-Paced Training Tutorials by reinforcing what the student learned in the tutorial, putting it into practice on the Universal Simulator. The simulation models are high fidelity and engineering correct, but represent a typical plant or typical process, rather than the exact replication of a client's plant. We have delivered over 360 such simulation models to clients consisting of major oil companies and educational institutions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Part-Task Training Simulators: Like our Universal Simulators, we provide other unique training solutions such as a generic nuclear plant simulator and VPanel® displays, which replicate control room hardware and simulator solutions specific to industry needs such as severe accident models to train on and aid in the understanding of events like the Fukushima Daiichi accident. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Plant-Specific Operator Training Simulators: These simulators exactly replicate the plant control room and plant operations. They provide the highest level of realism and training available, and allow users to practice their own plant-specific procedures. Clients can safely practice startup, shutdown, and other normal operations, as well as response to abnormal events we all hope they never have to experience in real life. Since our inception, we have delivered over 480 plant-specific simulators to clients in the nuclear power, fossil power and process industries worldwide.

- Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting
 As our customers' experienced staff retire, access to experts that can help operate and train existing and new employees in how to operate their plants is essential to ensure safe ongoing plant operations. In addition, operating and training needs change over time and sometimes our clients require fixed priced discrete projects or specialized courses in contrast to straight staff augmentation. The industry needs operating personnel, including procedure writers, engineers, operators and instructors who can step in and use as well as update the client's operating methods, procedures, training material and more. Finding technical professionals and instructors, who know the subject, can perform the work or teach it to others and can adapt to the client's culture, is critical. GSE provides qualified professionals, instructors and turnkey projects/courses that work within the client's system and complement the operating or training methods they already have in place. Examples of our training program courses include senior reactor operator certification, generic fundamentals training, and simulation supervisor training. In addition, we also provide expert support through consulting or turnkey projects for procedure writing, technical engineers, project managers, training material upgrade and development, outage execution, planning and scheduling, corrective actions programs, and equipment reliability.
 We bring together the collection of skills we have amassed over more than 40 years beginning with its traditional roots in custom high-fidelity simulation and training solutions for the power industries, extended through the acquisition of specialized engineering capabilities, enhanced by the entry and intermediate level training solutions of EnVision and the extensive nuclear industry training and consulting services of Absolute and Hyperspring.

The Company’s perpetual licenses have an unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and the parties adhere to the material terms and conditions.  The Company’s other licenses and subscription agreements have specified durations and usage terms, and may expire or be revoked in certain circumstances.
 The Company does not own any patents relevant to its business. The Company believes that all of the Company’s trademarks (especially those that use the phrase "GSE Systems") are valid and will have an unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and sufficiently used.
 GSE has numerous registered U.S. trademarks: GSE Systems®, JTOPMERET®, RELAP5-HD®, TOTALVISION®, VPanel® and SimExec®. Some of these trademarks have also been registered in foreign countries. The Company also claims trademark rights to DesignEP™, Java Application and Development Environment (JADE)™, OpenSim™, PSA-HD™, RACS™, SimSuite Pro™, SmartTutor™, THOR™, Xtreme I/S™, and others.
 In addition, the Company maintains federal statutory copyright protection with respect to its software programs and products, has registered copyrights for some of the documentation and manuals related to these programs, and maintains trade secret protection on its software products and proprietary technologies and methodologies.
 Despite these protections, the Company cannot be sure that it has protected or will be able to protect its intellectual property adequately, that the unauthorized disclosure or use of its intellectual property will be prevented, that others have not or will not develop similar technology independently, or, to the extent it owns any patents in the future, that others have not or will not be able to design around those patents. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which the Company’s products are sold do not protect its products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

Government Regulations
 Our operations are directly and indirectly affected by political developments and both domestic and foreign governmental regulations. We cannot determine the extent to which changing political priorities, new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations, positively or negatively.
Industries Served
 The following chart illustrates the approximate percentage of the Company's 2018 and 2017 consolidated revenue by industries served:
 
 | Years ended December 31,
------------------+-------------------------
 | 2018 | 2017
Nuclear power | 91% | 83% 
Fossil fuel power | 6% | 9% 
Process | 3% | 6% 
Other | 0% | 2% 
Total | 100% | 100%

Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $70.6 million of total gross revenue backlog compared to $71.4 million as of December 31, 2017.  Most of our contract terms are less than 24 months. Our backlog includes only those amounts that have been funded and authorized and does not reflect the full amounts we may receive over the term of such contracts.  Our backlog includes future expected revenue at contract rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client.  We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions or potential cancellations unless and until we have reason to believe that such changes may occur.
 Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and, therefore, may include significant estimated amounts of third-party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties.  Because backlog is not a defined accounting term, our computation of backlog may not necessarily be comparable to that of our industry peers.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 402 employees, which include approximately 191 in our Performance Improvement segment and 211 in our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment.   Excluding our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting business, which consists primarily of contracted instructors, our employee attrition rate for 2018 among all staff was approximately 11%.  To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and we expect our growth efforts to be addressed through attracting top talent. As a result of the DP Engineering acquisition that closed on February 15, 2019, we have added approximately 110 employees to the Company.

 GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 December 31, 2018 and 2017
 
 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
 Principles of consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GSE Systems, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively the Company). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
 Accounting estimates
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates used, including, but not limited to those related to revenue recognition on long-term contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts, product warranties, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets acquired, impairment of long-lived assets to be disposed of, valuation of contingent consideration issued in business acquisitions, valuation of stock based compensation awards and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
 Business combinations
 Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Company. Any excess purchase price is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
 Revenues and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations commencing on the date of acquisition.
 Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future financial measures of an acquired company. Under ASC 805, contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation is revalued to estimated fair value, and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations, and could cause a material impact to our operating results. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates, and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria.
 
 Revenue recognition
 
The Company derives its revenue through three broad revenue streams: 1) System Design and Build (SDB), 2) Software, and 3) Training and Consulting services. We recognize revenue from SDB and software contracts mainly through the Performance Improvement Solutions segment and the training and consulting service contracts through both the Performance Improvement Solutions segment and Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment.
 The SDB contracts are typically fixed-price and consist of initial design, engineering, assembly and installation of training simulators which include hardware, software, labor, and post contract support (PCS) on the software. We generally have two main performance obligations for an SDB contract: the training simulator build and PCS. The training simulator build performance obligation generally includes hardware, software, and labor. The transaction price under the SDB contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. We recognize the training simulator build revenue over the construction and installation period using the cost-to-cost input method as our performance creates or enhances assets with no alternative use to the Company, and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Cost-to-cost input method best measures the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, as PCS is deemed a stand-ready obligation.
 In applying the cost-to-cost input method, we use the actual costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs to measure the work progress toward the completion of the performance obligation and recognize revenue accordingly. Estimated contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses, and the cumulative effect of any change in estimates is recognized in the period in which the change is identified. Estimated losses are recognized in the period such losses are identified. Uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity, material costs, change order scope and pricing, software modification and customer acceptance issues. The reliability of these cost estimates is critical to the Company's revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause the Company's revenue and related margins to change significantly from the amounts estimated in the early stages of the project.
 The SDB contracts generally provide a one-year base warranty on the systems. The base warranty will not be accounted for as a separate performance obligation under the contract because it does not provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the completed project complies with agreed-upon specifications. Warranties extended beyond our typical one-year period will be evaluated on a case by case basis to determine if it provides more than just assurance that the product operates as intended, which requires carve-out as a separate performance obligation.
 Revenue from the sale of perpetual standalone and term software licenses, which do not require significant modification or customization, is recognized upon its delivery to the customer.  Revenue from the sale of subscription-based standalone software licenses, which do not require significant modification or customization, is recognized ratably over the term of such licenses following delivery to the customer.  Delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer receives a copy of the software and is able to use and benefit from the software.
 A software license sale contract with multiple deliverables typically includes the following elements: license, installation and training services, and PCS. The total transaction price of a software license sale contract is typically fixed, and is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Specifically, license revenue is recognized when the software license is delivered to the customer; installation and training revenue is recognized when the installation and training is completed without regard to a detailed evaluation of the point in time criteria due to the short-term nature of the installation and training services (one to two days on average); and PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, as PCS is deemed as a stand-ready obligation.
 The contracts within the training and consulting services revenue stream are either time and materials (T&M) based or fixed-price based. Under a typical T&M contract, the Company is compensated based on the number of hours of approved time provided by temporary workers and the bill rates which are fixed by type of work, as well as approved expenses incurred. The customers are billed on a regular basis, such as weekly, biweekly or monthly. In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-18, Revenue from contracts with customers, we elected to apply the "right to invoice" practical expedient, under which we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. The invoice amount represents the number of hours of approved time worked by each temporary worker multiplied by the bill rate for the type of work, as well as approved expenses incurred. Under a typical fixed-price contract, we recognize the revenue using the completed contract method as we are not able to reasonably estimate costs to complete and contracts typically have a term of less than 1 month.
 
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.
  32
 

 Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments including money market accounts with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
 
 Restricted cash
 
Restricted cash consists of the cash collateralization of outstanding letters of credit used for various advance payment, bid, surety and performance bonds. BB&T Bank has complete and unconditional control over the restricted money market accounts. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the cash collateral account totaled $0.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and was classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018, all BB&T accounts have been closed.
 
 Contract receivables, net
 
Contract receivables include recoverable costs and accrued profit not billed which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represent advanced billings to clients on contracts in advance of work performed. Generally, such amounts will be earned and recognized over the next twelve months.
 Billed receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends of past due accounts, write-offs, specific identification and review of customer accounts.
 
 Equipment, software and leasehold improvements, net
 
Equipment and purchased software are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
 
 Software development costs
 
Certain computer software development costs, including direct labor cost, are capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, typically three years. On an annual basis, or more frequently as conditions indicate, the Company assesses the recovery of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs the Company will write-down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on the future discounted cash flows. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related fair value is written down and charged to operations.
 
 Development expenditures
 
Development expenditures incurred to meet customer specifications under contracts are charged to contract costs. Company sponsored development expenditures are either charged to operations as incurred and are included in research and development expenses or are capitalized as software development costs. See Note 9, Software development costs. The amounts incurred for Company sponsored development activities relating to the development of new products and services or the improvement of existing products and services, were approximately $1.3 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of this amount, the Company capitalized approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
 Impairment of long-lived assets
 
Long-lived assets, such as equipment, purchased software, capitalized software development costs, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
  On December 27, 2017, the Board of the Company approved an international restructuring plan to streamline and optimize the Company’s global operations. As a result, the Company will be closing its offices in Nyköping, Sweden; Chennai, India; and Stockton-on-Tees, UK. The Company's management conducted an impairment review of the assets to be disposed of under the plan. Based upon this review, we recorded an impairment loss of $0.2 million representing the net book value of the equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization under the respective offices as of December 31, 2017. See Note 4, Restructuring Expenses.
 
 Goodwill and intangible assets
 
The Company’s intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with business acquisitions, including customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements and alliance agreements. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, except for contract backlog and contractual customer relations, which are recognized in proportion to the related project revenue streams. Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. The Company does not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
 Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASU 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level.
 ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2011-08, an entity is not required to perform step one of the goodwill impairment test for a reporting unit if it is more likely than not that its fair value is greater than its carrying amount.  For the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2018, the Company performed a qualitative step zero goodwill impairment test and concluded that it was more likely than not fair values of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. No goodwill impairment was recorded during 2018 or 2017.
 
 Foreign currency translation
 
The United States Dollar (USD) is the functional currency of GSE and our subsidiaries operating in the United States. Our subsidiaries' financial statements are maintained in their functional currencies. The functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the economic environment in which the subsidiary primarily does business. Our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements are translated into USD using the exchange rates applicable to the dates of the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are translated into USD using the period-end spot foreign exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments are cumulative translation adjustments, which are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity.
 For any business transaction that is in a currency different from the entity's functional currency, we record a gain or loss based on the difference between the exchange rate at the transaction date and the exchange rate at the transaction settlement date (or rate at period end, if unsettled) to foreign currency realized gain (loss) account, net gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Accrued warranty
 
For contracts that contain a warranty provision, the Company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience and projected claims. The Company's contracts may contain warranty provisions ranging from one to five years. The current portion of the accrued warranty is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets within current liabilities whereas the noncurrent portion is included in other liabilities.
 
 The activity in the accrued warranty accounts is as follows:

Ending balance | $ | 1,621 | | | $ | 1,953 | 

 
 Income taxes
 
Income taxes are provided under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. A provision is made for the Company's current liability for federal, state and foreign income taxes and the change in the Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
 
We establish accruals for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return when it is not more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Favorable or unfavorable adjustment of the accrual for any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are accounted for as income tax expense.
 
 Stock-based compensation
 
Share-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on a pro rata straight-line basis based on the value of share awards that are scheduled to vest during the requisite service period.
 
 Earnings per share
 
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares for the period.  Diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding vested stock options were exercised. Basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares for the period.

 The number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the determination of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share were as follows:

 Conversion of certain outstanding stock options was not assumed for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.
 
 Significant customers and concentration of credit risk
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have a concentration of revenue from two individual customers, which accounted for 14.3% and 26.9% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we have a concentration of revenue from two customers, which accounted for 18.2% and 20.8% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. These customers are part of Performance and both Performance and NITC segments, respectively. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 or 2017.
 As of December 31, 2018, we have one customer that accounted for 16.8% of the Company’s consolidated contract receivables. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had one customer that accounted for 26.7% of the Company’s consolidated contract receivables.
 
 Fair values of financial instruments
 
The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to their short term duration.
 
 Derivative instruments
 
The Company utilizes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Company's policy to use such derivative financial instruments to protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business in order to reduce the impact of these exposures. The Company minimizes credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions.

 Reclassifications and Immaterial Correction of an Error in Previously Issued Financial Statements
 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The Company reclassified the cash payments made to settle the contingent liability from acquisition in excess of the amount recognized at the acquisition date to operating activities from financing activities due to the adoption of ASU 2016-15.
 Subsequent to the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company determined that in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation: Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting, it had improperly recorded the release of $1.2 million of deferred tax asset valuation directly as an adjustment to its accumulated deficit account.  The Company corrected this error by recording the $1.2 million deferred tax asset valuation release as additional income tax benefit in its provision for income tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. The misstatement had no impact on ending accumulated deficit balance at December 31, 2017 or any net impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 Management evaluated the effect of the adjustment on the Company’s financial statements under the provision of ASC 250: Accounting Changes and Error Corrections and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108:  Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and concluded that it was immaterial to the current year and prior years’ annual and quarterly financial statements.

 The following are the impacted line items from the Company’s consolidated financial statements illustrating the effect of these revisions, in thousands (other than earnings per common share).

 Additionally, the Company identified a $0.7 million classification error between deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 due to improper netting of deferred taxes by jurisdiction. Accordingly, in our Form 10-Q for Q2 2018, we reclassified $0.7 million of deferred tax liabilities, which was included in other liabilities to deferred tax assets in our December 31, 2017 consolidated balance sheet.

Accounting pronouncements recently adopted
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. Subsequently, the FASB issued a series of updates to the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for such goods or services. In addition, the new accounting standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and interim periods therein.
 
We adopted ASU 2014-09 and all the related updates (collectively, the new revenue standard) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The new revenue standard was applicable to (1) all new contracts entered into after January 1, 2018 and (ii) all existing contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue has not been recognized under legacy revenue guidance. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an increase of $0.7 million to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
 
This adoption primarily affected our software license sales with multiple deliverables, which typically include the following elements: license, installation and training services and PCS. Under the legacy revenue recognition standard, due to the lack of vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), revenue was recognized ratably over the PCS period. Under the new revenue standard, the total transaction price is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices, and revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied.
 
 Select line items which were adjusted upon adoption were as follows (in thousands):

 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues and applies to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 was effective for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018, on a retrospective basis. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-15, cash payments made to settle a contingent consideration liability from an acquisition in excess of the amount recognized at the acquisition date are classified as operating activities, which were previously presented as financing activities. The comparative statement of cash flows has been restated to include only the payments made to settle the contingent liability related to the original amount recognized at the acquisition date in the financing activities; previously, the payment of $0.4 million related to fair value adjustment and interest accretion of the contingent liability was included in financing activities. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-15, it was reclassified as an operating activity.
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash. The new guidance applies to all entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and are required to present a statement of cash flows. This update is intended to reduce diversity in cash flow presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and requires entities to include all cash and cash equivalents, both restricted and unrestricted, in the beginning-of-period and end-of-period totals presented on the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018, on a retrospective basis. As the result of the adoption of ASU 2016-18, we restated the statement of cash flows for the comparative period to include both restricted and unrestricted cash in the beginning-of-period and end-of-period totals, and eliminated the transfers between restricted and unrestricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the definition of a Business, which amends the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 was effective for acquisitions commencing on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2017-01 effective January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively to acquisitions commencing on or after the effective date.
 
 Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.  The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees with capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Company anticipates adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of incremental right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities to its balance sheet upon adoption of the new standard in the range of $2.5 million to $3.5 million resulting from the recognition of office leases, currently accounted for as operating leases. The adoption will also result in an increase of $0.2 million to $0.4 million to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019.  Beginning in 2019, the Company expects changes to its disclosed lease recognition policies and practices, as well as to other related financial statement disclosures due to the adoption of this standard. The Company is finalizing its adoption of the new standard, including an evaluation of the potential impact on internal controls, and will report finalized impacts in the Company's first quarter 2019 Form 10-Q filing.
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which introduces new guidance for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and net investments in leases. The new guidance also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires the entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available-for-sale debt security is a credit loss. The standard also indicates that entities may not use the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position as a factor in concluding whether a credit loss exists. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.  ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation.  Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the carrying value of the goodwill.  ASU 2017-04 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-04 on our consolidated financial statements.

 2.  Acquisitions
 
 True North
 
On May 11, 2018, GSE, through Performance Solutions, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Donald R. Horn, Jenny C. Horn, and True North Consulting LLC (the True North Purchase Agreement) to purchase 100% of the membership interests in True North Consulting LLC (True North) for $9.75 million. The purchase price was subject to customary pre- and post-closing working capital adjustments, resulting in total consideration of $9.9 million. The True North Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnification provisions subject to certain limitations. An escrow of $1.5 million was funded from the cash paid to the sellers of True North at the closing and is available to GSE to promote retention of key personnel and satisfy indemnification claims for 18 months after the closing. After the indemnification period or if no claims are paid out, any remaining cash reverts to the seller. The acquisition of True North was completed on an all-cash transaction basis. In connection with the acquisition, we drew down a $10.3 million term loan to finance the transaction (including the transaction costs). See Note 11. Debt, for further information on the loan.
 True North is a provider of technical engineering solutions to nuclear and fossil fuel power plants with an emphasis on regulatory-driven ASME code programs. Located in Montrose, Colorado, True North is a well-regarded service provider to leading companies in the power industry. The acquisition of True North is expected to broaden our engineering services offering, expand our relationships with several of the largest nuclear energy providers in the United States, and add a highly specialized, complimentary talent pool to our employee base.
 
 The following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire True North and the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction. Due to the recent completion of the acquisition, the Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their preliminary estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not finalized the determination of the fair value allocated to various assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, contract receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, intangible assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued compensation and the residual amount allocated to goodwill. The following amounts except for cash are all reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows within the "Acquisition of True North Consulting, net of cash acquired" line caption.

 True North contributed revenue of $8.0 million to GSE for the period from May 11, 2018 to December 31, 2018.
 The goodwill is primarily attributable to broader engineering service offering to new and existing customers, the workforce of the acquired business and the significant synergies expected to arise after the acquisition of True North. The total amount of goodwill is expected to be tax deductible. All of the $4.7 million of goodwill was assigned to our Performance Improvement Solutions segment. As discussed above, the goodwill amount is provisional pending receipt of the final valuations of various assets and liabilities.
 
The Company identified other intangible assets of $5.1 million, including customer contracts and relationships, tradename, non-compete agreements, and alliance agreements, with amortization periods of four to fifteen years. The fair value of the intangible assets is provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for these assets.

Absolute
 On September 20, 2017, GSE, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Performance Solutions, acquired 100% of the capital stock of Absolute Consulting (Absolute) for $8.8 million pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement by and among Performance Solutions and the sellers of Absolute. The purchase price was subject to a customary working capital adjustment resulting in total consideration of $9.5 million. An indemnification escrow of $1.0 million was funded from the cash paid to the sellers and is available to GSE and Performance Solutions to satisfy indemnification claims until September 20, 2019. The acquisition of Absolute was completed on an all-cash transaction basis.
 Absolute is a provider of technical consulting and staffing solutions to the global nuclear power industry. Located in Navarre, Florida, Absolute has established long-term relationships with blue-chip customers primarily in the nuclear power industry. The acquisition of Absolute is expected to strengthen the Company's global leadership in nuclear training and consulting solutions, add new capacities to our technical consulting and staffing solutions offerings and bring highly complementary customers, while deepening relationships with existing clients.
 
 The following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire Absolute and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction.

 The goodwill is primarily attributable to the additional capacities to offer broader solutions to new and existing customers and the expected enhanced cost and growth synergies as a result of the acquisition. The total amount of goodwill that is expected to be tax deductible is $2.8 million. All of the $2.8 million of goodwill was assigned to our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment.
 The fair value of the assets acquired includes gross trade receivables of $5.1 million, of which the Company has collected in full subsequent to the acquisition. GSE did not acquire any other class of receivable as a result of the acquisition of Absolute.
 
  The Company identified $2.6 million of other intangible assets, including customer relationships and trademarks/names with amortization periods of three to ten years. The following table summarizes the fair value of intangibles assets acquired at the date of acquisition and the related weighted average amortization period:

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
 The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated information for GSE, True North and Absolute as if the business combination had occurred on January 1, 2017. The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared based on historical financial information.
 
These pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying GSE's accounting policies and adjusting the results of True North and Absolute to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to fixed assets and intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2017, with the consequential tax effects. In 2018, GSE has incurred $0.5 million of acquisition-related costs. These expenses are included in general and administrative expense on GSE's consolidated statements of operations and are reflected in pro forma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, in the table below. The pro forma financial information is not intended to reflect the actual results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it intended to be an indication of future operating results.

(1) Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective transition method for the adoption of ASC 606.
 
 SDB contracts are typically fixed-priced, and we receive payments based on a billing schedule as established in our contracts. The transaction price for software contracts is generally fixed. Fees for software are normally due in advance of or shortly after delivery of the software. Fees for PCS are normally paid in advance of the service period. For Training and Consulting Services, the customers are generally billed on a regular basis, such as weekly, biweekly or monthly, for services provided. Contract liability, which we classify as billing in excess of revenue earned, relates to payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
 
 The following table reflects the balance of contract liabilities and the revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liabilities from contracts with customers:

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+-------------------+--
Billings in excess of revenue earned (BIE) | $ | 10,609 | | $ | 14,543
Revenue recognized in the period from amounts included in BIE at the beginning of the period | $ | 11,275 | | | - 

 
 For an SDB contract, we generally have two main performance obligations: the training simulator build and PCS. The training simulator build generally includes hardware, software, and labor. We recognize the training simulator build revenue over the construction and installation period using the cost-to-cost input method. In applying the cost-to-cost input method, we use the actual costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs to measure the work progress toward the completion of the performance obligation and recognize revenue accordingly. Estimated contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses, and the cumulative effect of any change in estimates is recognized in the period in which the change is identified. Estimated losses are recognized in the period such losses are identified. Uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity, material costs, change order scope and pricing, software modification and customer acceptance issues. The reliability of these cost estimates is critical to the Company's revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause the Company's revenue and related margins to change significantly from the amounts estimated in the early stages of the project.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $2.0 million related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.
 As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations of SDB, software and fixed-price training and consulting services contracts is $41.6 million. The Company will recognize the revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied, which is expected to occur over the next twelve months.
 Part of the training and consulting services contracts are T&M based. Under a typical T&M contract, the Company is compensated based on the number of hours of approved time provided by temporary workers and the bill rates, which are fixed by type of work, as well as approved expenses incurred. As part of our adoption of ASU 2014-09, we have elected to use the optional exemption under ASC 606-10-50-14(b) Revenue from contracts with customers, pursuant to which we have excluded disclosures of transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations under such contracts and when we expect to recognize the revenue.

 4. Restructuring expenses
 
 On December 27, 2017, the Board of the Company approved an international restructuring plan to streamline and optimize the Company's global operations. Beginning in December 2017, GSE has been in the process of consolidating its engineering services and R&D activities to Maryland and ceasing an unprofitable non-core business in the United Kingdom (UK). As a result, the Company closed its offices in Nyköping, Sweden; Chennai, India; and Stockton-on-Tees, UK. These actions are designed to improve Company productivity by eliminating duplicate employee functions, increasing GSE's focus on its core business, improving efficiency and maintaining the full range of engineering capabilities while reducing costs and organizational complexity.
 
GSE eliminated approximately 40 positions due to these changes, primarily in Europe and India, and will undertake other cost-savings measures. The restructuring plan is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019. As a result of these efforts, as shown in the table below, GSE expects to record a restructuring charge of approximately $2.2 million in total, primarily related to workforce reductions, contracts termination costs and asset write-offs due to the exit activities. We recorded a restructuring charge of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and we expect to record the remaining charges, primarily reflecting the office closure costs, in the first quarter of 2019.
 In addition to the restructuring costs in the table below, the Company has an estimated $1.6 million of cumulative translation adjustments that will be charged against net income (loss) and an estimated $1.0 million of tax benefits that will be realized upon liquidation of these foreign entities.  GSE expects to recognize the remaining restructuring costs, currency translation adjustments and tax benefits by the first quarter of 2019.
 
 The following tables summarize the restructuring costs and restructuring liabilities at December 31, 2018. The amounts to be transferred from cumulative translation adjustments and included in determining net loss for the period, in which the liquidation of these foreign entities are completed (2019), are not included in the table below.

 The restructuring costs related to our Performance Improvement Solutions segment were included in the consolidated statement of operations within the "Restructuring charges" line caption. The accrued employee termination benefits of $52,000 were reflected in the "Accrued compensation" line in the consolidated balance sheets. $1.6 million of restructuring payments have been made as of December 31, 2018. There was no restructuring payment made for the year ended December 31, 2017.

 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill
 
 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, as defined by U.S. GAAP. After the acquisition of Hyperspring on November 14, 2014, the Company determined that it had two reporting units, which are the same as our two operating segments: (i) Performance Improvement Solutions; and (ii) Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting (which includes Hyperspring and Absolute).  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, goodwill of $13.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively, related to the acquisitions of Hyperspring, Absolute and True North Consulting. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in 2018 or 2017.
 
 The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018 was comprised of the following items:

Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization
 
As discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions, we recognized finite-lived intangible assets of $5.1 million upon acquisition of True North on May 11, 2018 and $2.6 million upon acquisition of Absolute on September 17, 2017, including customer contracts and relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements, and alliance agreements, with amortization periods of four to fifteen years. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets. The fair value of the intangible assets is provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for these assets.
 
 The following table shows the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of definite-lived intangible assets:

6.  Contract Receivables
 
Contract receivables represent the Company's unconditional rights to considerations due from a broad base of both domestic and international customers. All contract receivables are considered to be collectible within twelve months.
 
 Recoverable costs and accrued profit not billed represent costs incurred and associated profit accrued on contracts that will become billable upon future milestones or completion of contracts. The components of contract receivables are as follows:
 

(in thousands) | December 31, | 
--------------------------------+--------------+-------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | 
Billed receivables | $ | 15,998 | | | $ | 8,154 |

Allowance for doubtful accounts | | (427 | ) | | | (137 | )
Total contract receivables, net | $ | 21,077 | | | $ | 13,997 | 

 
 Management reviews collectability of receivables periodically and records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce our receivables to their net realizable value when it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends of past due accounts, write-offs, and specific identification and review of customer accounts. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded allowances for doubtful accounts of $294,000 and $118,000, respectively.
 During January 2019, the Company invoiced $4.1 million of the unbilled amounts related to the balance at December 31, 2018.
 As of  December 31, 2018, the Company had one customer that accounted for 16.8% of its consolidated contract receivables.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company had one customer that accounted for 26.7% of its consolidated contract receivables.

 Depreciation expense was $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 As discussed in Note 4, Restructuring Expenses, on December 27, 2017, the board of the Company approved an international restructuring plan to streamline and optimize the Company’s global operations. As a result, the Company will be closing its offices in Nyköping, Sweden; Chennai, India; and Stockton-on-Tees, UK, accordingly, the Company's management conducted an impairment test of the assets to be disposed of under the plan.
 The fixed assets under the respective offices primarily included computers, office equipment and furniture, software and leasehold improvements. As a result of this test, the Company concluded that these assets were no longer recoverable. Accordingly, we recorded a $0.1 million write-off of the fixed assets which represented the net book value of the respective assets for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was no fixed-asset write-off for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
 9.  Software Development Costs

 10.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principle or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
 The levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820 are:
 Level 1: inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
 Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. The Monte Carlo model was used to calculate the fair value of level 2 instruments. The inputs used are current stock price, expected term, risk-free rate, number of trials, volatility and interest rates.
 Level 3: inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The contingent consideration was based on EBITDA.
 The Company considers the recorded value of certain of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.
 The Company had $1.0 million and $2.3 million deposited in unrestricted money market accounts on December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had five standby letters of credit totaling $2.3 million which represent performance bonds on three contracts.
 
 The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2018:

 11.  Debt
 
Citizen's Bank
 
The Company entered into a three-year, $5.0 million revolving line of credit facility (RLOC) with Citizen's Bank on December 29, 2016, to fund general working capital needs, including acquisitions. Working capital advances bear interest of one-month LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum and letter of credit fees are 1.25% per annum. The RLOC will mature on December 29, 2019. The Company is not required to maintain a restricted cash collateral account at Citizen's Bank for outstanding letters of credit and working capital advances. The credit facility agreement is subject to standard financial covenants and reporting requirements.
 The maximum availability under the RLOC is subject to a borrowing base equal to 80% of eligible accounts receivable, and is reduced for any issued and outstanding letters of credit and working capital advances.  At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings on the RLOC and five letters of credit totaling $2.3 million. The amount available at December 31, 2018, after consideration of the borrowing base, letters of credit and working capital advances was approximately $2.7 million. At December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings on the RLOC and three letters of credit totaling $0.8 million.
 On May 11, 2018, GSE and Performance Solutions (collectively, the Borrower) entered into an Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with the Bank, amending and restating the Company's existing Credit and Security Agreement with the Bank, which included a $5 million asset-based revolving credit facility between the Borrower and the Bank, to now include (a) a $5 million revolving credit facility not subject to a borrowing base, including a letter of credit sub-facility, and (b) a $25 million delayed draw term loan facility available to be drawn upon for up to 18 months and to finance certain permitted acquisitions by the Borrower. The credit facilities mature in five years and bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin that varies depending on the overall leverage ratio of the Borrower and its subsidiaries. Revolving loans are interest-only with principal due at maturity, while term loans require monthly payments of principal and interest based on an amortization schedule.
 
The Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by GSE's wholly-owned subsidiaries Hyperspring, Absolute, and True North and by any future material domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors). The credit facilities are secured by liens on all assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors. The credit facility agreement is subject to standard financial covenants and reporting requirements. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants.
 
Term Loan
 
As discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions, we acquired True North on May 11, 2018 for total consideration of approximately $9.9 million in cash. We drew down $10.3 million to finance the acquisition of True North, $0.5 million of which was repaid to the Bank on the same day. The loan bears interest at the adjusted one-month LIBOR plus a margin ranging between 2% and 2.75% depending on the overall leverage ratio of the Company and matures in five years on May 11, 2023. We also incurred $70,000 debt issuance costs and $75,000 loan origination fees related to the Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs and loan origination fees are reported as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the loan and are amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.
 
 At December 31, 2018, the outstanding long-term debt under the delayed draw term loan facility was as follows:
 
Long-term debt, net of discount | $ | 8,512
Less: current portion of long-term debt | | 1,902
Long-term debt, less current portion | $ | 6,610

 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type that, among other things, require the Borrower to satisfy certain financial covenants and restrict the Borrower's and Guarantors' ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions after any applicable grace period could result in the obligations under the Credit Agreement becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the credit facilities. In addition to non-compliance with covenants and restrictions, the Credit Agreement also contains other customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the Bank may declare the obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and may terminate the credit facilities. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants.

 12.  Derivative Instruments
 
In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rate changes. We may seek to control a portion of these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative instruments.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
 
The Company utilizes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and minimize credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had foreign exchange contracts outstanding of approximately 3.2 million Euro, which will be valid through 2020. At December 31, 2017, the Company had contracts outstanding of approximately 162.5 million Japanese Yen, 24,000 Euro, and 0.2 million Australian Dollars at fixed rates. The contracts outstanding at December 31, 2017 have expired on various dates from January through December 2018.
 
Interest Rate Risk Management
 
As discussed in Note 11, Debt, the Company entered into a new term loan to finance the acquisition of True North in May. The loan bears interest at adjusted one-month LIBOR plus a margin ranging between 2% and 2.75% depending on the overall leverage ratio of the Company. As part of our overall risk management policies, in June 2018, the Company entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $9.0 million to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. The notional value amortizes monthly in equal amounts based on the five-year principal repayment terms. The terms of the swap require the Company to pay interest on the basis of a fixed rate of 3.02%, and GSE will receive interest on the basis of one-month USD-LIBOR-BBA-Bloomberg.
 
 The Company reports all derivatives at fair value. These contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities, depending upon the derivative’s fair value. The estimated net fair values of the derivative contracts on the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

 The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate as presented below:
 

 | Effective Tax Rate Percentage (%)
-----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------
 | Years ended December 31, 
 | 2018 | 2017 
Statutory federal income tax rate | 21.0% | 34.0% 
State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit | 30.1% | (184.7)% 
Effect of foreign operations | (2.1)% | 55.4% 
Change in valuation allowance | (43.6)% | (2,332.0)%
Meals and Entertainment | 10.0% | 37.9% 
Stock based compensation | (6.9)% | (81.7)% 
162(m) Limit on compensation | 0.0% | 52.2% 
Subpart F Income | 0.0% | 3.0% 
Other permanent differences | 0.4% | 0.2% 
Uncertain Tax Positions | 46.3% | 338.1% 
Change in tax rate | (2.8)% | 618.1% 
Worthless stock deduction | 0.0% | (257.0)% 
Expired stock options | 50.7% | 30.2% 
Change in APB 23 | (4.4)% | 46.0% 
Prior year reconciling items | (2.4)% | 117.3% 
Expiration of capital Loss | 49.3% | 0.0% 
Effective tax rate | 145.6% | (1,523.0)%

 
 The difference between the effective rate and statutory rate in 2018 primarily resulted from permanent differences, the write-off of the stock option deferred tax asset due to expirations, accruals related to uncertain tax positions for certain foreign tax contingencies and revenue recognition, expiration of capital loss, and return to provision true-ups. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted in the US on December 22, 2017. The Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%.  In 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the Act by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment-date accounting for these effects. In 2018, the Company concluded its’ analysis under SAB 118 and determined that the changes to 2017 enactment-date provisional amounts increased the effective tax rate in 2018 by 1.77%.

 Deferred tax liabilities are included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet.
 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the preponderance of positive evidence that could be demonstrated by three year cumulative positive earnings, reversal of existing deferred temporary differences, and generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of deductible temporary differences.
 As of each reporting date, the Company's management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management's view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. This analysis is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The Company provides forward forecasting which is incorporated into the scheduling analysis to support realization of the deferred tax assets.
 Based on the assessment the Company's management performed as of December 31, 2018, we conclude that critical pieces of positive evidence supporting the realization of deferred tax assets exist including the strength of three year cumulative positive earnings, reversal of existing deferred temporary differences and future taxable income for the U.S. entities. As a result, the Company has determined that a valuation allowance in the U.S. is not appropriate at this time. A portion of the deferred tax assets is attributable to a capital loss that expired unutilized as of December 31, 2018 because the Company could not support the realization of this DTA, therefore, a valuation allowance has historically existed. The Company was not able to generate sources of capital income and, therefore the expiration and write-off of the capital loss deferred tax asset also generated the release of the valuation allowance existing at December 31, 2017 in the amount of $0.4 million.
 The Company currently does not have sufficient positive objectively verifiable evidence to substantiate the recovery of the deferred tax assets for India, U.K,  Swedish and Chinese deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018, accordingly, a full valuation allowance of $0.75 million has been established on these deferred tax assets, predominantly comprised of net operating losses.
 At December 31, 2018, the Company's largest consolidated deferred tax asset was $5.1 million, excluding the impact of uncertain tax provisions. It primarily relates to a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $4.4 million, which expires in various amounts between 2020 and 2037. The amount of U.S. loss carryforward which can be used by the Company each year is limited due to changes in the Company's ownership which occurred in 2003. However, the Company does not anticipate that any of the loss carryforward will expire unutilized.
 On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R.1, commonly referred to as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the Act), resulting in significant modifications to existing law.
 The Company follows the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides additional clarification regarding the application of ASC 740 in situations where the Company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act for the reporting period in which the Act was enacted. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period beginning in the reporting period that includes the Act’s enactment date and ending when the Company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, but in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date.
 
The Company has completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Act. There were no material changes from what was reported as of December 31, 2017. The Company recognizes the tax on GILTI as a period cost in the period the tax is incurred. Under this policy, we have not provided deferred taxes related to temporary differences that upon their reversal will affect the amount of income subject to GILTI in the period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, there is no GILTI inclusion.
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.1 million and $19.1 million, respectively, including cash and cash equivalents held at non-U.S. entities totaling $4.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The non-U.S. entities include operating subsidiaries located in China, United Kingdom, Sweden and India.  Of these, the Company does not assert permanent reinvestment in the UK, Sweden or India.  Accordingly, the Company analyzed the cumulative earnings and profits and determined no US deferred liability exists given aggregated accumulated deficits. A deferred tax liability in the amount of $0.1 million has been recorded for India with respect to the undistributed earnings related to India’s application of a Dividend Distributions Tax. Undistributed earnings in China are considered indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2018, to fund the Company's ongoing international operations. If China were to repatriate the funds it would not incur any tax due to an accumulated earnings and profits deficit.
 The Company has made an entity classification (CTB) election to treat GSE UK as a disregarded entity effective January 1, 2018.  Therefore, as of January 1, 2018, GSE UK is treated as a branch of the US for tax purposes. Accordingly, GSE UK’s 2018 activity has been included in the US Company’s income tax provision.

Uncertain Tax Positions
 
Foreign Uncertain Tax Positions
 
During 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded tax liabilities for certain foreign tax contingencies. The Company recorded these uncertain tax positions in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
During 2017, the Company recorded a tax liability for an uncertain tax position related to the worthless stock deduction on the liquidation of GSE UK. The uncertain tax position is recorded as a component of current and deferred liability.
 
During 2018, the Company recorded a tax liability for an uncertain tax position related to revenue recognition in the US. The uncertain tax position is recorded as a component of current and deferred liability.
 
We believe that is it reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $133,907 in unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state tax exposures may be necessary within the next 12 months due to the intention of the Company to file an accounting method change related to revenue recognition for tax purposes.
 
 The following table outlines the Company's uncertain tax liabilities, including accrued interest and penalties for each jurisdiction:

 15.  Stock-Based Compensation
 
Long-term incentive plan
 During 1995, the Company established the 1995 Long-Term Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Plan), which permits the granting of stock options (including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options) stock appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted stock awards, phantom stock, performance awards or any combination of these to employees, directors or consultants. The Plan expires on April 21, 2026; the total number of shares that could be issued under the Plan is 7,500,000. As of December 31, 2018, 4,174,981 shares have been issued under the Plan, 55,000 stock options and  1,571,525 restricted stock units (RSUs) were outstanding under the Plan, while 2,247,848 shares remain for future grants under the Plan.
 
The Company recognizes compensation expense on a pro rata straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock-based compensation awards with both graded and cliff vesting terms. The Company recognizes the cumulative effect of a change in the number of awards expected to vest in compensation expense in the period of change. The Company has not capitalized any portion of its stock-based compensation. The Company's forfeiture rate is based on actuals.
 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method. Accordingly, the Company recognized associated deferred income tax benefits of $53,000 and $330,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were approximately $(142,000) and $74,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to the change in fair value of cash-settled RSUs, which the Company accounts for as a liability.
 
Stock options
 
Options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the Plan expire in either seven or ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable in three, five, or seven installments with a certain percentage of options vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and additional options vesting on each of the subsequent anniversaries of the grant date, subject to acceleration under certain circumstances.

 18.  Segment Information
 
The Company has two reportable business segments.
 The Performance Improvement Solutions segment provides simulation, training and engineering products and services delivered across the breadth of industries we serve. Solutions include simulation for both training and engineering applications. Example engineering services include, but are not limited to, plant design verification and validation, thermal performance evaluation and optimization programs, and engineering programs for plants for ASME code and ASME Section XI. The Company provides these services across all market segments. Example training applications include turnkey and custom training services. Contract terms are typically less than two years.
 The Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment provides specialized workforce solutions primarily to the nuclear industry, working at clients’ facilities. This business is managed through our Hyperspring and Absolute subsidiaries.  The business model, management focus, margins and other factors clearly separate this business line from the rest of the GSE product and service portfolio.
 On May 11, 2018, GSE, through Performance Solutions acquired True North. True North is a provider of technical engineering solutions to nuclear and fossil fuel power plants with an emphasis on regulatory-driven ASME code programs. The acquisition of True North is expected to broaden our engineering services offering, expand our relationships with several of the largest nuclear energy providers in the United States, and add a highly specialized, complimentary talent pool to our employee base. For reporting purposes, True North is included in our Performance Improvement Solutions segment due to similarities in services provided including technical engineering solutions to the nuclear and fossil fuel power sector.
 In September 20, 2017, the Company acquired Absolute. Absolute is a provider of technical consulting and staffing solutions to the global nuclear power industry and employs approximately 160 professionals with expertise in procedures writing, engineering, technical support, project management, training, project controls, and corrective actions. This acquisition brings a natural adjacency to GSE, fits well with our growth strategy, and benefits our customers from expanded capabilities and offerings. For reporting purposes, Absolute was aggregated with Hyperspring into our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment due to similarities in services provided including training and staff augmentation to the nuclear energy sector. In addition, both entities report to the same management team and share support staff such as sales, recruiting and business development.  As such, 100% of the goodwill acquired was allocated to the Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment.
 
 The following table sets forth the revenue and operating results attributable to each reportable segment and includes a reconciliation of segment revenue to consolidated revenue and operating results to consolidated income before income tax expense (benefit). Inter-segment revenue is eliminated in consolidation and is not significant.

20.  Subsequent Events
 
On February 15, 2019, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Performance Solutions, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Steven L. Pellerin, Christopher A. Davenport, and DP Engineering (The “DP Engineering Purchase Agreement”), to purchase 100% of the membership interests in DP Engineering for $13.5 million. The purchase price is subject to customary pre- and post-closing working capital adjustments plus an additional earn-out amount not to exceed $5.0 million, potentially payable in 2020 and 2021 depending on DP Engineering’s satisfaction of certain targets for Adjusted EBITDA in calendar years 2019 and 2020, respectively.  The acquisition was completed through the drawdown of $14.3 million (including transaction costs) of the term loan. An escrow of approximately $1.7 million was funded at the closing and is available to GSE and Performance Solutions to satisfy indemnification claims for 18 months after the closing.
 DP Engineering is a provider of value-added technical engineering solutions and consulting services to nuclear power plants with an emphasis on preparation and implementation of design modifications during plant outages.  Located in Fort Worth, Texas, DP Engineering is well-regarded as a leading service provider to the nuclear power industry, having been designated an “engineer of choice” by two large power generation companies.  The Company's allocation of the purchase price remains incomplete and the net assets are subject to adjustments within the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.
