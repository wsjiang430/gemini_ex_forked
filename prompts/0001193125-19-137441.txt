ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Business Combination 
 OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited (OneSpaWorld, the Company, we, our, us and other similar terms refer to OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries), is the pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and a leading operator of health and wellness centers at destination resorts worldwide. Our highly trained and experienced staff offer guests a comprehensive suite of premium health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products onboard 163 cruise ships and at 67 destination resorts globally as of December 31, 2018. We entered into the business combination (the Business Combination) contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2018 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Transaction Agreement), by and among us, Steiner Leisure Limited, an international business company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas (Steiner Leisure), Steiner U.S. Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation, Nemo (UK) Holdco, Ltd., a limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales, Steiner UK Limited, a limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales, Steiner Management Services, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Haymaker Acquisition Corp. a Delaware corporation (Haymaker), Dory US Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Dory Acquisition Sub, Limited, an international business company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, Dory Intermediate LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Dory Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Business Combination enabled us to re-enter the public markets as a leader in global health and wellness services and enhance our ability to deliver the world class service and innovation that our cruise line and resort partners have come to expect from our organization. 
General 
 At our core, we are a global services company. With over 80% market share in the highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market, we are the market leader at approximately 10x the size of our closest maritime competitor. Over the last 50 years, we have built our leading market position on our depth of staff expertise; broad and innovative service and product offerings; expansive global recruitment, training and logistics platform; and decades-long relationships with cruise and destination resort partners. Throughout our history, our mission has been simple: helping guests look and feel their best during and after their stay. We serve a critical role for our cruise line and destination resort partners, operating a complex and increasingly important aspect of their overall guest experience. Decades of investment and know-how have allowed us to construct an unmatched global infrastructure to manage the complexity of our operations, which in 2017 included nearly 8,000 annual voyages with visits to over 1,100 ports of call around the world. We have consistently expanded our onboard offerings with innovative, leading-edge service and product introductions, and developed a powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platform to manage our operational complexity, maintain our industry-leading quality standards and maximize revenue per center. The combination of our renowned recruiting and training platform, deep labor pool, global logistics and supply chain infrastructure and proven revenue management capabilities represents a significant competitive advantage that we believe is not economically feasible to replicate.

The majority of our revenue and profits are earned through long-term revenue sharing agreements with cruise line partners that economically align both parties and contribute to our attractive asset-light financial profile. These agreements average approximately five years in length and provide us with the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships it serves. Under these long-term agreements, cruise line partners retain a specified percentage of revenues from all our sales onboard. This inherent alignment encourages collaboration in all aspects of our operations, including facility design, product innovation, pre- and post-cruise sales opportunities, capacity utilization initiatives and other data-driven strategies to drive increased guest traffic and revenue growth. Most of our cruise line agreements encompass 100% of a partner cruise lines existing fleet and all new ships introduced by the cruise line during the term of the agreement. As opposed to fixed-rent landlords, cruise lines and destination resorts serve as our aligned economic partners. 
 We are recognized by our cruise line and destination resort partners and our guests for our comprehensive suite of services and products. We curate and deliver an exhaustive range of offerings centered on providing specific health and wellness solutions to meet our guests lifestyle routines or objectives. These services include: (i) traditional body, salon, and skin care services and products; (ii) specialized fitness classes and personal fitness training; (iii) innovative pain management, detoxifying programs and comprehensive body composition analyses; (iv) weight management programs and products; and (v) advanced medi-spa services. We also offer our guests access to leading beauty and wellness brands including ELEMIS®, Kérastase® and Dysport®, with many brands offered exclusively by us at sea. On average, guests spend $230 per visit and our solution sales approach drives substantial retail sales, with approximately 25% of our revenues derived from the sale of retail products.

Our state-of-the-art health and wellness centers are designed and branded for each cruise line and destination resort to optimize the guest experience, align with the overall hospitality atmosphere and maximize productivity. Centers can employ up to 45 highly trained professionals and range in size from 200 to over 30,000 square feet, depending on the cruise or resort partners needs.

 Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Costa and Holland America, among many others. These partnerships extend across contemporary, premium, luxury and budget cruise lines that operate ships globally. We maintain an exceptional contract renewal rate with our cruise line partners, having renewed approximately 95% of our contracts based on ship count over the last 15 years, including 100% of our contracts with ships larger than 3,500 berths. We have not only maintained relationships with existing cruise line partners, but have a history of winning contracts and gaining market share. In 2019, we signed an agreement with the new lifestyle brand Virgin Voyages as the exclusive operator of the spa and wellness offerings onboard the first three Virgin vessels planned to launch in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In 2018, we signed an agreement with Celebrity Cruises as the exclusive operator of health and wellness centers onboard our highly anticipated Edge Class of mega ships, including the Celebrity Edge, which launched in November 2018, and three additional mega ships scheduled to launch in 2020, 2021 and 2022. On land, we have longstanding relationships with the worlds leading destination hotel and resort operators, including Marriott, Starwood, Hilton, ClubMed, Caesars Entertainment, Lotte, Loews and Four Seasons, among others. 
 

As a Bahamian international business company that earns a substantial portion of our revenue in low- or no-tax jurisdictions, we have benefited from a highly attractive effective cash tax rate. Additionally, we have minimal capital expenditures as third parties typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our onboard health and wellness centers. The combination of our attractive tax rate and asset-light operating model leads to a financial profile that delivers exceptional Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. Annually, from 2016 through 2018, we converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow.

 We have driven strong financial results and believe our leading market position in a growing industry, differentiated business model and entrenched partner relationships position our business for continued growth. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we achieved revenues of $540.8 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $58.6 million, Net Income of $13.7 million and Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow of $52.9 million. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures see Summary Historical and Other Financial Information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Attractive Market Opportunity 
 We operate at the intersection of the highly attractive health and wellness and travel leisure industries. We are well-positioned to continue growing through the cruise industrys reliable new cruise ship and passenger growth, consumers desire for travel and experiences and the increasing focus on health and wellness in consumers every day lives. 
Highly Dependable Cruise Industry Growth 
 The cruise industry has been among the fastest-growing segments in the travel leisure industry with passenger growth for more than 20 consecutive years, including through the recessions of 2001 and 2008. We estimate, based on annual statistics published by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), that global passenger counts have grown every year from approximately 6.3 million passengers in 1995 to an all-time high of 28.0 million passengers in 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.7%. This dependable passenger growth has been driven by consistent, significant investments in new cruise ship capacity, strong loyalty among experienced cruisers and the large and growing appeal of cruising to all demographics, including millennials. In 2019, millennials are projected to represent the largest segment of the U.S. population, and according to CLIAs 2018 cruise travel report, they are also most likely to book a cruise for their next vacation. 
 

Cruising remains underpenetrated globally and is poised for continued growth. Based on research from CLIA, in 2016, cruise passengers in the United States represented 3.6% of the population, which was second to Australia with a penetration rate of 5.4%. According to 2017 data, these penetration rates compare favorably against alternative vacations and leisure activities, including visits to the Disneyland theme park at 5.6% of the U.S. population, visits to U.S. snowsports facilities at 16.8% of the U.S. population, and visits to Australian snowsports facilities at 8.7% of the Australian population. China remains incredibly underpenetrated with a cruising penetration rate of just 0.2% of the population in 2017, representing a significant opportunity.

 Today, the Fourth Wave of cruise industry expansion is in our early phases in Asia, as cruise operators and the Chinese government invest heavily in Asian cruise port infrastructure. The global cruise market has witnessed three distinct periods, or waves, of geographic expansion over the last 40 years as the industry grew its presence into new regions of the world. The first wave comprised the period during the early 1980s that saw the emergence of the North American and Caribbean cruise market. The second wave occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s as the European market evolved to reflect the itinerary diversity seen in North America, and the third wave was driven by industry expansion to the rest of the world, excluding Asia, in the latter half of the 2000s. Each of these waves saw investment by cruise lines in new ship capacity to service these regions, as well as significant investment by cruise operators and local governments in cruise port infrastructure to enable increased itinerary diversity and enhance the attractiveness of cruise travel throughout these regions. In 2015, Carnival Corporation and the Chinese State Shipbuilding Corporation established a joint venture for a shipbuilding consortium at a Shanghai shipyard, which will build mega class cruise ships for the Chinese market. Cruise Industry News reports that Asian cruise capacity grew at a CAGR of 18.3% from 2011 to 2015 and is projected to grow at a 15.2% CAGR from 2015 to 2022. Cruise Industry News projects passenger counts in the Asian market will reach European volumes within the next 5 to 10 years, and some cruise operators predict during that time that Asian passenger counts may even surpass North American volumes, which are the largest in the world. 
 Consumers Increasingly Spending on Experiences and Travel 
 Global consumers are increasingly prioritizing experiences over products, creating a significant tailwind for leisure and travel. According to Coresight Research, since 2002, the split of U.S. discretionary spending has shifted from 50% services and 50% products to 55% services and 45% products in 2017. This change implies an incremental $139 billion in spending on services or related experiences, such as travel, in the United States alone. Globally, according to the World Bank, the number of international travel departures around the world has roughly doubled over the past two decades from more than 600 million in 1996 to 1.3 billion in 2015. The outlook remains positive, as the Deloitte 2018 Travel and Hospitality Industry Overview projects that the global hotel industry will sustain strong 5%-6% growth to achieve a record $170 billion in gross booking in 2018. We are poised to benefit from global consumers shift toward experiences and travel with a global network of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at premier destination resorts around the world. 
Large and Growing Health and Wellness Industry 
 Our health and wellness centers cater to guests seeking a continuation of their wellness activities while traveling and those who want to trial services while away from home. According to The Global Wellness Institute (GWI), the global wellness economy is growing at nearly twice the rate of the broader economy, achieving a total value of $4.2 trillion in 2017. As consumers increasingly incorporate health and wellness activities into their daily lives, they are placing a higher priority on health and wellness services while traveling. GWI estimates that wellness-related tourism grew at twice the rate of general tourism from 2015 to 2017 and projects it to grow at a 7.5% compound annual growth rate from $639 billion in 2017 to $919 billion in 2022. 
Our Evolution 
 Our history dates back to the early 1960s, when we opened the worlds first salons at sea onboard transatlantic cruise ships, including the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth II. Over more than 50 years, we have continuously defined and redefined the onboard health and wellness category by consistently expanding our onboard offerings with innovative and leading-edge service and product introductions, while developing the powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platforms to manage and optimize the complexity of our operations and maintain our industry-leading quality standards. We have successfully evolved the onboard health and wellness category from what was once a consumer-centric amenity for passengers to a key onboard revenue driver for cruise line partners.

 In 2015, a consortium led by L Catterton acquired Steiner Leisure, the holding company of OneSpaWorld (the 2015 Transaction). Since then, OneSpaWorld has strengthened its already proven platform by leveraging L Cattertons expertise in multi-unit retail and customer acquisition. At sea, OneSpaWorld has enhanced collaboration with its cruise line partners to reinforce its market leading position and introduced innovative revenue initiatives to accelerate its onboard revenue growth. Key recent initiatives include:

 Today, our comprehensive suite of premium health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products reaches more consumers than ever before, with 165 centers onboard cruise ships addressing a captive audience of over 20 million passengers annually and 67 destination resort centers serving global travelers at premier destination resorts around the world. 
 Our Strengths 
 Global Leader in the Hospitality-Based Health & Wellness Industry 
 As the pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and a leading operator of health and wellness centers at destination resorts worldwide, we are at the center of the intersection between the health and wellness and travel leisure industries. Global wellness tourism is a $639 billion industry, according to the GWI, and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% through 2022. We command over 80% market share in the highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market and we are nearly 10x the size of our closest competitor. Through our market share, we have access to a captive audience of over 20 million passengers. Cruise ship guests are an attractive demographic with average annual household incomes of over $100,000. Based on an independent study conducted by a global strategy consulting firm, approximately 45% of cruise guests are interested in or have participated in wellness activities during their cruise while our revenues have been historically driven by approximately 10% of cruise ship passengers. As a result of our scale, our captive audience and consumers increasing desire for more health and wellness services, we are well-positioned in the growing global health and wellness industry and have a large addressable market at sea and on land. 
 Differentiated Business Model That Would Be Difficult and Non-Economical to Replicate 
 For more than 50 years, our business model has been built through investment in global infrastructure and training, decades-long relationships with our cruise line and destination resort partners and our reputation for offering guests a best-in-class wellness experience. The robust infrastructure and processes required to operate and maximize revenue across our network of global health and wellness centers separates us from our peers. We embarked on almost 8,000 voyages that welcomed over 20 million passengers at more than 165 ports of embarkation in 2017. Our business model is centered on providing our partners with the following solutions: 
 
7 


 
 | Global Recruiting, Training and LogisticsWe recruit, train and manage over 3,000 professionals annually around the world, representing 86 nationalities and 27 spoken languages. With nine global training facilities, we can accommodate each cruise lines needs for specific onboard staff with complex language, cultural and service modality requirements and are the only company with the infrastructure to commission highly trained staff at over 1,100 ports of call worldwide at a moments notice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Supply Chain and LogisticsWe manage the complex distribution of all products and supplies to our floating centers, leveraging proprietary data to accurately forecast and stock each center. Products can only be loaded at designated ports around the world during a limited window of time while the ship is in port, adding to the complexity of the process.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Yield and Revenue ManagementWe have developed proprietary technology, processes and staff training tools to consistently measure, analyze and maximize onboard revenue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Exclusive Relationships with Global BrandsDue to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive audience, we currently have over 600 product SKUs offered through the OneSpaWorld platform at sea, including ELEMIS, Kérastase, Thermage®, GoodFeet® Arch Supports and GO SMILE® Teeth Whitening.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Facility Design and Branding ExpertiseWe design our state-of-the-art health and wellness centers specifically for each cruise line and destination resort partner by creating bespoke branding and concepts to optimize guest experiences and maximize productivity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The above capabilities have contributed to building a differentiated and defensible strategy around our leading market position in a growing and attractive industry. 
 Unmatched Breadth of Service and Product Offering 
 We offer our guests a comprehensive suite of health and wellness services and products to meet any and all of their needs. We are continuously innovating and evolving our offerings based on the latest trends and tailors our service and product offerings to regional preferences. In addition to wellness and beauty services, we offer the latest in fitness, a full range of massage treatments, nutrition/weight management consultations, teeth whitening, acupuncture and wellness services. OneSpaWorld has also introduced innovative, higher-ticket medi-spa services, including BOTOX® Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane®, CoolSculpting®, Thermage and dermal fillers, among others. With our captive audience of over 20 million cruise guests annually, OneSpaWorld is a compelling distribution channel for leading wellness and beauty brands. Renowned brands, including ELEMIS and Kérastase, have partnered with us for exclusive distribution at sea. Cruise and resort partners depend on us to provide their guests with the best and broadest assortment of services and products to enhance their vacation experience. 
Entrenched Partnerships with Economic Alignment 
 We have cultivated partnerships with many of the largest and most reputable cruise lines and premier resorts in the world. Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Costa and Holland America, among many others. The majority of our revenues and profits are earned through our long-term revenue sharing agreements with our cruise line partners that economically align both parties and create a collaborative relationship. On land, we partner with market leaders at highly-attractive destinations, including Atlantis Paradise Island Bahamas, The Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort, Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort and Spa and the Mohegan Sun Resort. Our long-standing relationships, with economic alignment at the core, strengthens our competitive advantage. 
Highly Visible and Predictable Revenue Streams 
 We consistently have access to over 20 million passengers annually with passenger growth expected to continue as new ships are commissioned in the industry. This new ship growth is highly visible as demonstrated in a publicly available global order book outlining over five years of new ship orders. Across our contracts, OneSpaWorld typically operates on all ships in a fleet and on new ships added during the contract term, securing both existing and new ship revenue. A new ship requires approximately two to four years to be built and is rarely delayed as cruise lines typically sell out the vessels maiden voyage over a year in advance. New ships do not have a 
 
8 


  revenue ramp-up period given these advanced marketing efforts. Cruise line partners are experts at dependably filling their ships with passengers, as demonstrated by the industry average occupancy rate of above 100%, even through recessionary periods. Due to consistent industry practices and decades of proprietary operating history data, OneSpaWorld has strong visibility into our future revenue realization for the next three to five years. 
 Asset-Light Model with Tremendous After-Tax Free Cash Flow Generation 
 Third parties typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our onboard health and wellness centers, resulting in an asset-light profile with minimal capex required. Our capital expenditures have averaged 1% of revenues over the last three years. Being a Bahamian international business company and earning a significant portion of our revenue in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, our effective cash tax rate has been approximately 2% over the last three years. This combination translates to exceptional after-tax free cash flow. Annually, from 2016 through 2018, we converted approximately 90% of its Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. 
 Seasoned and Proven Leadership Team 
 OneSpaWorld is led by a management team that has operated Steiner for nearly 20 years. Our Executive Chairman, Leonard Fluxman, and CFO and COO, Stephen Lazarus, together led Steiner Leisure as a public company for more than a decade. Mr. Fluxman, Mr. Lazarus and our Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Fusfield, now lead an internally developed senior management team with over 150 years of combined industry experience. We will also benefit from Haymakers investing and operational experience at Fortune 500 companies, particularly in the consumer and hospitality sectors. The OneSpaWorld management teams deep experience and proven track record in managing the business in both public and private markets positions makes OneSpaWorld an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the global hospitality-based health and wellness industry. 
Growth Strategies 
 Our management plans to continue growing the business through the following strategies: 
 Capture Highly Visible New Ship Growth with Current Cruise Line Partners 
 We will continue benefiting from the cruise industrys capacity growth, with a consistent and visible pipeline of new ships commissioned annually by our cruise line partners. From 2019 to 2023, our existing cruise line partners are expected to build 35 new ships, representing over 119,000 new berths, which is an approximate 25% increase in our estimated year-end 2018 berth count. Approximately 85% of our 2020 projected revenues at sea are expected to be generated from the existing fleet and new ships being launched by cruise lines already under contract with us. As our existing cruise line partners, expand into the Asian region over the longer-term, we will be well-positioned to grow revenue alongside our cruise line partners as we have over 70% market share in the region today. Through established cruise line partner relationships, current contracts and an approximately 95% contract renewal rate over the last 15 years, we are well-positioned to capture new ship growth over the long term. 
Expand Market Share by Adding New Potential Cruise Line Partners 
 Although we have over 80% market share in the outsourced maritime health and wellness market, there is an opportunity to continue to grow our market share by winning new contracts. Recently, we won a contract with the new lifestyle brand Virgin Voyages to operate the spa and wellness offerings onboard the first three Virgin vessels, planned to launch in 2020, 2021 and 2022, and a contract with Celebrity Cruise Lines to design and operate the health and wellness centers onboard their four new mega ships to be commissioned between 2018 and 2022. We also routinely meet with cruise lines that do not currently outsource their health and wellness centers or utilize our smaller competitors but that may have an interest in contracting with us in the future due to our strong reputation and historical results. As evidenced by our successful history of winning new contracts, we are focused on continuing to grow our market share at sea over time.

 Continue Launching More Value-Added Services and Products 
 We have successfully innovated services and products to meet guests ever-changing needs, attract more guests and generate more revenue per guest. Medi-spa has been a highly successful innovation for OneSpaWorld at sea and is now a critical component of our offerings. Performed by licensed physicians, the medi-spa offerings provide the latest cosmetic medical services to guests such as non-surgical cosmetic procedures, including BOTOX® Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane®, CoolSculpting®, Thermage and dermal fillers. Guests purchasing medi-spa services spend on average up to 10x more than on traditional services. We also initiated a trial of Kérastase, a leading global professional hair care brand, in 2017 and experienced a 30% increase in total guest spending and improved retail attachment by more than 25% during the trial period. We will continue to focus on launching higher value-add products and services that meet guest demands and drive traffic through our highly productive centers. 
 Focus on Enhancing Health and Wellness Center Productivity 
 Cruise lines have become increasingly focused on growing onboard revenue as a way to enhance revenue beyond traditional cabin ticket sales. Between 2011 and 2017, onboard spend as a percentage of total cruise line revenue has increased over 480 basis points to nearly 30%, translating to $2 billion of incremental onboard spending. We provide services to approximately 10% of cruise passengers on any one journey, while 45% of passengers say they are interested in using the centers onboard, per an independent global consulting study. We are focused on collaborating with cruise line partners to increase passenger penetration and maximize revenue yield through the following initiatives: 

 | Increase Pre-Booking and Pre-Payment Capture RateWe are working with our cruise line partners to expand our marketing efforts to reach a guest before boarding a ship through pre-booking. Pre-booked appointments yield approximately 60% more revenue than services booked onboard the ship. Due to our success across select cruise lines that have implemented pre-booking capabilities, we are in the process of implementing pre-booking across many of our other partner cruise lines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand Targeted Marketing and Promotion InitiativesWe are now directly marketing and distributing promotions to onboard passengers as a result of enhanced collaboration with select cruise line partners. These promotions are personalized and individually tailored to guests profiles and have successfully driven traffic and revenue at our health and wellness centers. Examples include happy anniversary messages to couples, happy birthday notes to individual guests, and promotional retail credits offered to guests who visit our centers before the end of their cruise. On vessels implementing these initiatives, guests that received these customized promotions were responsible for over 6.5% of revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2018 and spent approximately 5.5% more during their visit than guests that did not receive customized promotions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Utilize Technology to Increase Utilization and Enhance Service MixWe have recently begun to successfully introduce and expand technology-enabled dynamic pricing initiatives with selected cruise line partners. While dynamic pricing strategies have historically been applied manually by onboard staff, we are currently rolling out online and pre-cruise access to drive off-peak utilization rates and fill higher-demand time slots with higher-value bookings. This enhanced dynamic pricing capability is currently available with only a few cruise line partners, representing a significant opportunity for revenue growth as it is rolled out and optimized fleet-wide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Extend Retail Beyond the ShipOur Shop & Ship program provides guests the ability to buy retail products onboard and have products shipped directly to their home to avoid the hassle of packing products in their luggage. On average, a Shop & Ship customer spends more than 3.5x the amount of a non-Shop & Ship customer on retail products. The Shop & Ship program, combined with our eCommerce platform timetospa.com, gives us the ability to maintain a connection with each guest beyond the cruise voyage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selectively Expand Footprint at Destination Resorts 
 We have long-standing relationships with many leading hotel and hospitality companies around the world such as Marriott, Starwood, Hilton, ClubMed, Caesars Entertainment, Lotte, Loews and Four Seasons, among others. We believe we are a proven turnkey operator for our partners. With health and wellness centers in 
 
10 


  67 destination resorts, with 17 in North America and 50 in Asia, this reflects only a handful of resort centers per partner, or approximately 1% of our partners total resorts. As such, we believe there is significant potential to operate additional centers within their resort partner portfolios. We will selectively expand our resort footprint when attractive unit economics can be generated. Given our unit growth potential, global infrastructure and proven platform, we have a significant opportunity to further expand our destination resort footprint. 
 Health and Wellness Services 
 We curate and deliver an exhaustive range of offerings for our cruise and destination resort partners centered around a holistic wellness approach which includes: 
 

 | Spa and Beauty. We offer massages and a broad variety of other body and beauty treatments including facials, hair cutting and styling, manicures and pedicures, and tanning. Additionally, we offer teeth whitening services in the majority of our onboard health and wellness centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medi-spa. We offer medi-spa services on the majority of our ships. Our service menu consists of the leading medi-spa brands including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, and dermal fillers, among others. Currently, medi-spa services are available on 91 ships and administered by certified medical physicians.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fitness. We offer guests use of fitness centers as well as paid services by a fitness professional to our cruise and destination resort guests. The fitness centers are typically free and offer guests use of strength equipment, cardiovascular equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, exercise bicycles and rowing and stair machines. Boutique fitness classes, including yoga, Pilates, cycling, and aerobics, are also available to guests for a fee or at no charge, depending on the class. Our fitness instructors are available to provide paid services, such as body composition analysis and personal training.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Nutrition. In addition to fitness services, we offer guests paid services including personal nutritional and dietary advice, weight management, nutrition coaching and detoxification. Guests can begin a program on the cruise and remain connected to our professional coach after the cruise to ensure successful completion of the program, such as a nutrition or detoxification plan.

Products 
 We sell over 600 branded product SKUs due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive audience at sea and on land. We sell products from leading brands including ELEMIS, Thermage, Dysport, GoodFeet Arch Supports and GO SMILE Teeth Whitening. We have an exclusive 10-year supply contract with ELEMIS. We believe we have a leading retail attachment rate based on the number of products purchased in conjunction with a service compared to the broader retail industry. Approximately 25% of our revenues come from product sales, enabling incremental revenue even at full treatment room utilization. 
 We have two warehouses, one 20,000 square foot bonded warehouse in Miami, FL and another 4,000 square foot warehouse in New Jersey. The Miami warehouse provides fulfillment services for cruise inventory, and the New Jersey warehouse provides fulfillment for e-Commerce and the Shop & Ship program. 
 Health and Wellness Centers 
 As of December 31, 2018, we operated state-of-the-art health and wellness centers across a total of 163 ships, including almost all of the major cruise lines globally, and 67 resorts principally in the United States, the Caribbean and Asia. Centers are designed and branded for each cruise and destination resort partner to optimize the guest experience, maximize revenues and align with our partners hospitality environment. Centers can range in size from approximately 200 square feet to over 30,000 square feet and generally provide fitness areas, treatment rooms and salons, as well as elaborate thermal suites and/or saunas. Cruise centers are generally located on higher ship decks, which encourages increased passenger interest and guest traffic.

 Facility Design 
 Our partners seek differentiated health and wellness experiences for their guests. As such, we provide design capabilities for our cruise line and destination resort partners, creating bespoke branding and design consulting to optimize guest experiences and maximize revenues. We operate health and wellness centers under proprietary brands of Mandara® and Chavana® as well as brands curated specifically for each cruise line, complete with cruise line and/or ship-specific service menus. We have 34 health and wellness centers under the Mandara brand, 12 centers under the Chavana brand, one destination resort health and wellness center under the ELEMIS brand, and one center under our newest destination resort health and wellness brand, Glow®, a Mandara Spa. 
 Principal Cruise Line Customers 
 A significant portion of our revenues is generated from each of the following cruise lines, which accounted for more than ten percent of our total revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively: Carnival (including Carnival, Carnival Australia, Costa, Holland America, P&O, Princess, and Seabourn cruise lines): 48.5%, 48.6% and 48.1%, Royal Caribbean (including Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur and Azamara cruise lines): 21.0%, 20.8% and 20.2% and Norwegian Cruise Line: 13.8%, 13.0% and 13.2%. These companies, combined, accounted for 138 of the 163 ships served by OneSpaWorld as of December 31, 2018. Our contracts are signed at the cruise line-level, not with the parent operator, giving OneSpaWorld a diverse customer base despite parent-level consolidation. Our contracts average 5 years in duration.

Cruise Line and Resort Agreements 
 Through the cruise line and resort agreements, we have the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships and at destination resorts we serve. Under the cruise agreements, guests pay for our services through the cruise partners who retain a specified percentage of gross receipts from such sales before remitting the remainder to us. Our revenue share agreements result in a highly variable cost model, where the primary fixed costs are the meals and accommodations for our cruise employees. Most of the cruise line agreements cover all of the then-operating ships of a cruise line and typically new ships are added to ships in service through an amendment to the agreement. The agreements have specified terms ranging from one to eight years, with an average remaining term per ship of approximately five years. Cruise lines can terminate the agreements with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances, including, among other things, the withdrawal of a ship from the cruise trade, the sale or lease of a ship, or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards. However, we have never had a contract terminated prior to our respective expiration date. 
 We operate our destination resort centers pursuant to agreements with the owners of the properties involved. Our destination resort centers generally are required to pay rent based on a percentage of our revenues, with others having fixed rents. Some of our destination resort center agreements also require that we make minimum rental payments irrespective of the amount of our revenues. The terms of the agreements for our destination resort centers generally range from five to 20 years (including the terms of renewals available at our option). In North America, destination resort centers generally have a higher investment cost and lower revenue share with higher staff costs and contracts lasting 10 years on average. In Asia, destination resort centers have lower investment cost, higher revenue share, lower staff costs, and contracts averaging five years. 
 Recruiting and Training 
 Our continued success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract qualified employees. Our goal in recruiting and training new employees is to have available a sufficient number of skilled personnel trained in our customer service philosophy. We recruit prospective cruise employees from geographies including the British Isles, Australia, South Africa, the Philippines, Canada, the Caribbean and continental Europe, providing an ample pipeline of talent to fulfill any demographic preferences. Recruitment professionals source potential employees using a variety of 
 
13 


  recruitment techniques including advertisements in trade and other publications, appearances at beauty, hair, and fitness trade shows, meetings with students at trade schools, and recommendations from our employees. Candidates are generally required to have received prior training and certifications in the services they will perform and are tested in their specific modalities. Prospective employees for destination resorts are also required to have received prior training but are recruited in a customary manner within the respective destination region. 
 Our candidates complete a rigorous training program at one of our nine global training facilities or at one of the destination resorts. We train over 3,000 employees annually and have 56 training, administrative, and recruitment staff to execute that training. Training courses are typically conducted over a period of one to six weeks, depending on the modality, and emphasize use of personalized, attentive guest care and the unique requirements of each cruise line partner. Additionally, employees are trained from day one in yield management and cross-selling products. This training covers, among other things, maximization of revenues, personnel supervision, customer service, and administrative matters, including interaction with cruise line and destination resort personnel. Given the complex human capital requirements, we consider our recruitment and training infrastructure to be a key barrier to entry. 
 Marketing and Promotion 
 We promote our services and products to cruise passengers and resort guests through targeted marketing, including pre-and post-cruise emails, website advertising, on-site demonstrations and seminars, video presentations shown on in-cabin/in-room television, ship newsletters, tours of our centers, and dedicated signage around the ship. We also encourage our employees to cross-sell as they believe that such cross-promotional activities frequently result in our customers purchasing services and/or products in addition to those they initially contemplated buying. For example, we cross-sell the fitness body assessment with detox programs, vitamins, and seaweed wraps. We also maintain a dedicated sales desk to facilitate pre-cruise health and wellness services booking and to disseminate health and wellness information for charters and other groups of cruise passengers. 
 Recent collaborative initiatives with cruise line partners have proven to enhance performance across certain key performance indicators. We have developed a fully integrated pre-booking platform which allows guests to book health and wellness treatments six to eight weeks prior to the voyage. Pre-booked and pre-paid guests on average spend approximately 60% more than guests who book services once already onboard. We recently introduced targeted marketing, including the positive surprise direct marketing campaign where guests receive a targeted gift card to celebrate a birthday, honeymoon, anniversary, or other special occasion. Guests who received the positive surprise campaign spent approximately 50% more in the health and wellness centers, which translated to a 6% increase in onboard spend. We have begun rolling out our dynamic pricing model to our full cruise fleet, which provides the ability to optimize demand and maximize utilization of the health and wellness center. We continually monitor the results of our marketing efforts and adjust our strategies in order to use our marketing resources in a cost-effective manner. 
 Competition 
 We face competition in our cruise ships and destination resorts. On cruise ships, we compete with passenger activity alternatives for onboard passenger dollars. We also compete with other maritime wellness facility providers, including cruise lines that insource the activity as well as other outsource providers. The largest outsource provider after us is currently Canyon Ranch, which operates on 22 ships as of December 31, 2018. Across the resorts business, we compete with other hotel operators that outsource health and wellness services. The destination resorts business is highly fragmented, and there is no one leader within this category. 
Seasonality 
 A significant portion of our revenues are generated onboard cruise ships. Certain cruise lines, and, as a result, we have experienced varying degrees of seasonality as the demand for cruises is stronger in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays. Accordingly, the third quarter and holiday periods generally result in the highest revenue yields for us. Further, cruises and destination resort health and wellness centers have been negatively affected by the frequency and intensity of hurricanes. The negative impact of hurricanes is highest during peak hurricane season from August to October.

 Trademarks 
 We hold or control numerous trademarks in the United States and a number of other countries. Our most recognized health and wellness products and services trademarks are for Mandara and Chavana. We believe that the use of our trademarks is important in establishing and maintaining our reputation for providing high quality health and wellness services as well as cosmetic goods, and we are committed to protecting these trademarks by all appropriate legal means. 
 Registrations for the OneSpaWorld, Mandara and Chavana trademarks, among others, have been obtained in a number of countries throughout the world. We continue to apply for other trademark registrations in various countries. 
 While a number of the trademarks we use have been registered in the United States and other countries, the registrations of other trademarks that we use are pending. Recently we have adopted the mark OneSpaWorld as the trade name of our maritime health and wellness business to reflect our position as a global provider of shipboard products and services. 
 We license Mandara for use by luxury destination resorts in certain Asian countries. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 4,146 employees. Of that number, 3,660 worked in health and wellness operations, and 458 represented management and sales personnel and support staff, while 28 were involved in recruiting and training. We have one health and wellness center manager in each center and can have up to 45 total staff depending on the size of the center. Cruise employees typically are employed under nine month-long agreements with fixed terms. In recent years, we have improved staff retention, resulting in a more experienced staff across our fleet. Employees at our destination resorts generally are employed without contracts, on an at-will basis, although most of our employees in Asia have one- or two-year contracts. 
 Most cruise and destination resort employees compensation consists of commission based on the volume of revenues generated by the employee. Cruise managers receive incentive payments, including a commission based on the volume of revenue generated by our staff under their management. Destination resort managers receive a salary, plus bonus, if appropriate, based on various criteria. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
