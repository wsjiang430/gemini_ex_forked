Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing personalized immune therapies for cancer. We have developed a platform technology, DCVax®, which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient's own immune system to attack their cancer.


Our lead product, DCVax®-L, is designed to treat solid tumor cancers in which the tumor can be surgically removed. This product is in an ongoing 331-patient Phase III trial for newly diagnosed Glioblastome multiforme (GBM). On May 29, 2018, interim blinded data from the Phase III trial collected in 2017 were published in a peer reviewed scientific journal. On November 17, 2018, updated interim blinded data from the Phase III trial were presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology annual meeting. As the Company noted in its announcement of the publication and in subsequent reports, the data could get either better or worse as it continues to mature. The Company has been consulting with its Scientific Advisory Board, the Steering Committee of the trial and other independent experts about the ongoing handling of the trial


As previously reported, the Company is now moving forward with the several stages of work that are needed to reach completion of this trial. These include finalizing the Statistical Analysis Plan, conducting the final data collection, data validation and data lock, and then unblinding and analyzing the data. Each of these stages are multi-month processes, involving teams of outside experts as well as Company personnel. This work also involves substantial pioneering, without a well-established pathway or roadmap since very few personalized cell therapies have reached late stage development. Accordingly, the Company’s projections, estimates and expectations are subject to material changes as the work proceeds.


Our second product, DCVax®-Direct, is designed to treat inoperable solid tumors. A 40-patient Phase I trial has been completed, and included treatment of a diverse range of cancers. The Company is working on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct.
 
The DCVax Technology
 
Our platform technology, DCVax, is a personalized immune therapy that uses a patient's own dendritic cells, or DCs, the master cells of the immune system, as the therapeutic agent. The patient’s DCs are obtained through a blood draw, or leukapheresis. The DCs are then activated and loaded with biomarkers (“antigens”) from the patient’s own tumor. For DCVax-L, the antigen loading process takes place during the manufacturing of the product. For DCVax-Direct, the antigen loading process takes place in situ in the tumor after the product is directly injected into the patient’s inoperable tumor. The loading of antigens into the DCs “educates” the DCs about what the immune system needs to target. 
Clinical Trials and Early Access Programs
 
DCVax-L for Operable Solid Tumors: GBM Brain Cancer
 
Our lead product candidate is DCVax-L for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): the most aggressive and lethal type of brain cancer. With standard of care treatment for GBM today, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the median time to tumor recurrence is about 7 months, and the median survival is about 15-17 months. There is an urgent need for new and better treatments.
 
DCVax-L is currently in a 331-patient Phase III trial. The Company has reported on the blinded interim data (the data from both arms of the trial combined) and the Company is now in the process of working towards completion of the trial, as described above.

The Company plans to conduct Phase II trials of DCVax-L in combination with other agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, when resources permit. Such combination trials may include DCVax-L and Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for colorectal cancer, as the Company has previously reported. Certain preparatory work will be required and regulatory approvals will have to be obtained for these trials, in addition to financing.
 
DCVax-L Early Access Programs
 
In March 2014, we received approval from the German regulatory authority of a “Hospital Exemption” for DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers under Section 4b of the German Drug Law outside of our Phase III trial. We undertook treatment of 9 patients under the Hospital Exemption. During 2018, we transferred our European manufacturing to the UK, and terminated such activities in Germany. As part of this termination of activities, we notified the German regulatory authorities that we were returning the Hospital Exemption license (which requires in-country manufacturing).
 
As previously reported, we have also treated a substantial number of compassionate use patients, under an Expanded Access Protocol in the US. We have also treated compassionate use patients as “Specials” in the U.K.  


DCVax-Direct for Inoperable Solid Tumor Cancers
 
Our DCVax-Direct product offers a potential new treatment option for inoperable tumors. This can potentially apply to a wide range of clinical situations: for example, situations in which patients' tumors are considered inoperable because the patient has multiple tumors, or their tumor cannot be completely removed, or the surgery would cause undue damage to the patient and impair their quality of life.
 
A large number of patients with a variety of cancer types are faced with this situation, because their tumors are already locally advanced or have begun to metastasize by the time symptoms develop and the patients seek diagnosis and treatment. For these patients, the outlook today is bleak and survival remains quite limited.
 
DCVax-Direct is administered by direct injection into a patient's tumors. It can potentially be injected into any number of tumors, enabling patients with locally advanced disease or with metastases to be treated. With image guidance, DCVax-Direct can also be injected into tumors in virtually any location in the body.
 
We conducted a 40-patient Phase I trial of DCVax-Direct at MD Anderson Cancer Center and at Orlando Health. The patients enrolled in this trial had failed other treatments, and had multiple tumors and actively progressing disease. In spite of this heavy disease burden, since the trial was primarily to demonstrate safety, the treatment regimen in this first clinical trial was very conservative: only one tumor was injected in each patient, and most of the patients received only 3 treatments over the course of 2 weeks, with some receiving a 4th treatment at week 8 and beyond.
 
Despite these challenging circumstances, effects seen in various patients include examples of tumor necrosis (i.e., cell death) in the injected tumors, shrinkage or stabilization in some non-injected tumors, stabilization of disease and survival times beyond what was expected.


This Phase I trial was designed to be very informative: we treated numerous diverse types of cancers (sarcoma, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, melanoma and others); we tested three different dose levels and various methods of image-guided administration; we collected both imaging and biopsy data, and correlated them with clinical effects in patients; we evaluated both local effects in the injected tumors and systemic effects in the non-injected tumors; we evaluated potential endpoints for future trials; and most importantly, we evaluated safety.
 
In the Phase I stage of the DCVax-Direct Phase I/II trial, the safety profile was excellent (as has also been the case over the years with DCVax-L). Typically, patients develop a fever after the injections, to a limited extent and for a limited duration, and they do not generally experience any significant toxicities.
 
Based upon the data and experience to date, we are planning to proceed with Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct in various cancers, when resources permit. In the Phase II trials, we plan to inject multiple tumors, rather than just one tumor, and we plan to administer more doses than in the Phase I trial.


Target Markets for DCVax Products
 
Since our DCVax-L product is potentially applicable to all types of operable solid tumors, and our DCVax-Direct product is potentially applicable to all types of inoperable solid tumors, we believe that the potential markets for DCVax products are particularly large. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 2 men, and 1 in 3 women, in the U.S. will develop some form of cancer in their lifetime. There are nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer per year in the U.S., and nearly 600,000 deaths from cancer. The incidence is similar in Europe, the U.K. and elsewhere.

Brain cancer
 
Brain cancers fall into two broad categories: primary (meaning the cancer first originates in the brain) and metastatic (meaning the cancer first appears elsewhere in the body, but subsequently metastasizes or spreads to the brain). In the U.S. alone, on an annual basis, there are some 40,000 new cases of primary brain cancer (including about 12,000 cases of GBM, the most severe grade of primary brain cancer), and some 160,000 new cases of metastatic brain cancer. The incidence is similar in Europe, the U.K. and elsewhere.


In addition, brain cancer is a serious medical problem in children 18 years and under. It is the second most frequent type of childhood cancers (after leukemias) and, following progress in reducing death rates from leukemias, it is now a leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.
 
Very little has changed in the last 30 years in the treatment and clinical outcomes for GBM. With typical standard of care treatment today - surgery, radiation and chemotherapy - patients still generally die within a median of about 15-17 months from diagnosis. Loco-regional therapy with alternating electric fields has recently shown an increase in median Progression Free Survival (i.e., time to tumor recurrence) to 6.7 months, and median Overall Survival to 20.9 months, respectively from randomization in clinical trials. However, there has been no material advance in survival with systemic therapies since the addition of temozolomide more than 12 years ago, despite investigations with many diverse agents. There is an urgent need for new treatment options.
 
Manufacturing of DCVax
 
We use a batch manufacturing technology for our DCVax products, and we believe this manufacturing approach is a key part of the practicality of our product and its economic feasibility. Generally, we are able to produce enough doses for the patient’s treatment regimen through just one manufacturing process. When a batch of DCVax product has been made, we then cryopreserve it.
 
Both of these technologies, the personalized batch manufacturing for each patient and the cryopreservation, are essential elements of our manufacturing model and product economics. Together, they enable us to usually incur the high costs of manufacturing just one time for each patient, and then store the multi-year or multi-dose quantity of product, frozen, in single doses. This makes DCVax effectively an “off the shelf” product for the patient after the initial manufacturing, even though it is personalized, and we anticipate that this will enable the pricing of DCVax to be in line with other new cancer drugs. We also believe that both economies of scale and automation will further enhance the product economics. The manufacturing process today is also rapid: about 8 days for DCVax-L, and 7 days for DCVax-Direct, followed by quality control and release testing (including a sterility test that may take a couple of weeks) .


We contract out the manufacturing of our DCVax products to Cognate BioServices for the U.S. and Canada, and to Advent BioServices (formerly Cognate U.K.) for Europe. Although there are many contract manufacturers for small molecule drugs and for biologics, there are very few companies who specialize in manufacturing living cell products. Manufacturing of cellular products is fundamentally different than production of small molecules or biologics, and the regulatory requirements are very difficult to meet. Both Cognate BioServices and Advent BioServices specialize in the production of cellular products.
 
Our DCVax programs generally require that the applicable manufacturing capacity be dedicated exclusively to our programs. Most medical products, including other types of cellular products, are made in batches on a pre-scheduled basis. In contrast, our products are fully personalized and can only be made in individual personalized batches, not large-scale batches of standardized products, and our products are made on demand, on an ongoing basis. So, the manufacturing suites generally must be dedicated entirely to NW Bio’s products.
 
Cognate BioServices’ manufacturing facility for clinical-grade cell products is located in Memphis, Tennessee. Cognate BioServices' facility is approximately 80,000 square feet, and produces both the Company’s DCVax products and other clients’ products. We believe the current manufacturing facilities have the potential to produce DCVax for at least several thousand patients per year. We are also developing facilities for manufacturing in the U.K. for the European market. It is necessary for us to have manufacturing operations in Europe to meet the logistical requirements for European patients relating to the collection, delivery and processing of the patient’s blood draw containing the immune cells (for which the time window is too limited to reach the US manufacturing facility).
 
Intellectual Property and Orphan Drug Designation
 
We have an integrated strategy for protection of our technology through both patents and other mechanisms, such as Orphan Drug status. As of December 31, 2018, we have over 190 issued patents and more than 65 pending patent applications worldwide, grouped into 12 patent families. Of these, 181 issued patents and 35 pending patent applications directly relate to our DCVax products. In the United States and Europe, some of our patents and applications relate to the composition and use of products, while other patents and applications relate to other aspects such as manufacturing and quality control. For example, in the United States, we have four issued and seven pending patent applications that relate to the composition and/or use of our DCVax products. We also have other U.S patents and applications that cover, among other things, quality control for DCVax and an automated system which we believe will help enable the scale-up of production for large numbers of patients on a cost-effective basis. Similarly, in Europe, we have five patents issued by and six pending patent applications with the European Patent Office (“EPO”) that cover our DCVax products, and other patents and applications that cover aspects such as manufacturing and quality control, and the automated system. In Japan, we have seven issued patents and three pending patent applications relating to our DCVax products, as well as manufacturing related patents. Patents have been granted and are pending in other foreign jurisdictions which may be potential future markets for our DCVax products.

During 2018, two new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover methods and devices for manufacturing dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain dendritic cell compositions for direct injection into patient tumors related to DCVax-Direct.
 
During 2017, six new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover a variety of subject matter, including certain processes and methods for manufacturing and for enhancing the potency of dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain dendritic cell compositions for direct injection into patient tumors related to DCVax-Direct. 
 
The expiration dates of the issued U.S. patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2026. The expiration dates of the issued European patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2024. For some of the earlier dates, we plan to seek extensions of the patent life, and believe we have reasonable grounds for doing so.
 
In addition to our patent portfolio, we have obtained Orphan Drug designation for our lead product, DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers. Such designation brings with it a variety of benefits, including potential market exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in Europe if our product is the first of its type to reach the market.
 
This market exclusivity applies regardless of patents, (i.e., even if the company that developed it has no patent coverage on the product). In addition, the time period for such market exclusivity does not begin to run until product sales begin. In contrast, the time period of a patent begins when the patent is filed and runs down during the years while the product is going through development and clinical trials. 
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. A large and growing number of companies are actively involved in the research and development of immune therapies or cell-based therapies for cancer (including Juno, Kite, Bellicum, Argos, Agenus, Asterias, Dandrit, Immunicum, Sotio, Tocagen, AiVita and many others). In addition, many big pharma companies (including BMS, Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche and others) are rapidly commercializing checkpoint inhibitor drugs to “take the brakes off” patients’ immune responses to cancer. Other novel technologies for cancer are also under development or have recently been approved, such as the Optune electro-therapy device of NovoCure and oncolytic viruses. Additionally, many companies are actively involved in the research and development of monoclonal antibody-based and bi-specific or tri-specific antibody-based cancer therapies. Currently, a substantial number of antibody-based drugs are approved for commercial sale for cancer therapy, and a large number of additional ones are under development. Many other third parties compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat cancer, including: biopharmaceutical companies; biotechnology companies; pharmaceutical companies; academic institutions; and other research organizations, as well as some medical device companies.


We face extensive competition from companies developing new treatments for brain cancer. These include a variety of immune therapies, as mentioned above, as well as a variety of small molecule drugs and biologics. There are also a number of existing drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with our product, including, Avastin® (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel® (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar® (Merck & Co., Inc.), as well as the Optune electro-therapy device (Novocure) and oncolytic viruses. Both checkpoint inhibitor drugs and T cell-based therapies are pursuing clinical trials for solid tumors, including brain cancer, as well.
 
Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and sales than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and collaborators, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs, and in obtaining sites for our clinical trials and enrolling patients.
