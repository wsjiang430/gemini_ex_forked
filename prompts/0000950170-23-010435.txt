 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the next wave of medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including dermal, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases. We are developing next-generation, highly selective, oral small-molecule inhibitors of KIT, a cell surface receptor that serves as the master regulator of mast cell function and survival. Early clinical studies have demonstrated that KIT inhibition has the potential to address the treatment of a broad range of mast-cell-mediated inflammatory diseases, and that a titratable, oral, intracellular small molecule inhibitor may provide an optimal therapeutic profile against this target. Our initial focus is on developing a KIT inhibitor to treat chronic urticaria.
 In December 2022, we announced the discontinuation of our Phase 1b clinical trial of our product candidate THB001 in chronic inducible urticaria following observation of asymptomatic liver transaminitis in two patients enrolled in the first dose cohort. We initiated nonclinical studies to elucidate the mechanism for the observed transaminitis, which was not predicted by extensive toxicology studies including those conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, of THB001 nor observed in our Phase 1a clinical trial. In parallel with the early clinical development of THB001, we have conducted an extensive medicinal chemistry effort to identify chemically distinct next-generation oral wild-type KIT inhibitors and have advanced multiple candidate molecules into exploratory toxicology studies. We intend to nominate a development candidate from this program in 2023.
 The Phase 1b clinical trial in chronic inducible urticaria was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of three dose levels of THB001 over 12 weeks of treatment. Five patients were enrolled in the first dose cohort of 200mg twice daily, or BID. The first subject completed the full 12-week dosing period with no signs or symptoms of liver toxicity. The second and third patients presented with elevations in alanine transaminase or ALT, and aspartate transaminase, or AST, at their week eight study visits, and dosing was halted for both patients. No alternate causes for the transaminitis have been identified, and the patients continue to be monitored per study protocol. We stopped dosing of the fourth and fifth patients enrolled at weeks four and two of dosing, respectively, and neither of these patients has shown any signs or symptoms of liver toxicity to-date. Clinical follow-up of the five enrolled patients will continue per protocol, but no additional patients will be enrolled in the trial.
 Preliminary analyses showed evidence of pharmacodynamic and clinical activity at the 200mg BID dose. We plan to present the full data set from the five enrolled patients at an upcoming scientific conference, and we intend to provide an update on overall corporate strategy and outlook in early 2023.
 Given the preliminary clinical activity observed in the first patients enrolled in the Phase 1b clinical trial, we plan to continue the development of a next generation oral wild-type KIT inhibitor as we believe this to be an important treatment modality for mast cell-driven inflammatory diseases.


Our Strategy
 Our goal is to develop the next wave of medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The key components of our strategy are to:
 •Develop next-generation KIT inhibitors in a broad range of indications across therapeutic areas where mast cell driven inflammation can benefit from a highly selective, oral small molecule, including in the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. We believe that KIT inhibition may find wide therapeutic utility across a range of inflammatory indications, as mast cells are present in numerous tissue types. There are multiple skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions such as atopic dermatitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic rhinusitis, allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and irritable bowel syndrome, where we believe mast cells maintain a vital role in driving the pathophysiology of the disease. We believe these potential opportunities represent attractive markets with clinical unmet need and established development and regulatory pathways.
 •Continue to innovate and potentially expand the pipeline through our internal discovery efforts and selectively evaluate strategic collaborations. Our team brings invaluable experience from all aspects of drug discovery, clinical development, business development and commercialization. We will continue to invest in research and development and evaluate potential selective collaboration opportunities to build upon our deep knowledge base of oral small molecule KIT inhibition to potentially advance next-generation compounds and expand our pipeline in inflammatory diseases.
 We are focused on developing a portfolio of highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitors of KIT, a cell surface receptor that acts as the master survival and functional regulator of mast cells. Mast cells are a part of the immune system, and dysfunctional mast cell activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a broad range of inflammatory disorders including urticaria, asthma and gastrointestinal disorders, among others. KIT inhibition has shown positive clinical responses in mast cell mediated diseases such as asthma and chronic urticaria.
 Mast cells are a primary driver of allergic inflammatory responses. They are present throughout the body in connective and vascularized tissues, most prominently along surface boundaries with exposure to the external environment: in the skin, the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract. For many patients suffering from allergic conditions, inhibition of mast cell derived mediators, including histamines, leukotrienes and prostaglandins, has demonstrated limited therapeutic value to-date given that many mast cell-driven disorders involve multiple pro-inflammatory mediators. As a result, we believe that targeting mast cells directly through highly selective inhibition of KIT is key to achieving the clinical efficacy needed for broad symptomatic relief across a range of inflammatory disorders.
 Since KIT is a cell surface receptor that acts as the master regulator of mast cell function and survival, our approach impacts mast cells directly and provides what we believe to be a favorable point of intervention. Furthermore, significant clinical and nonclinical data has been generated internally and by third parties that demonstrate that KIT is a potential target for broad and potentially clinically differentiated inhibition of mast cells. For example, an anti-KIT antibody demonstrated positive clinical responses in chronic inducible urticaria patients in a third-party Phase 1 trial. In nonclinical studies, THB001 demonstrated what we believe to be evidence of highly selective KIT inhibition and mast cell depletion in skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues with a potent therapeutic profile. We believe that chronic urticaria represents an attractive initial clinical indication for an oral KIT inhibitor. Our goal is to be a leader in the oral KIT inhibitor space, and we continue to invest in formulation and discovery for next generation molecules.
 There remains a large unmet need in chronic urticaria. Epidemiological studies indicate that up to 25% of the population suffers from urticaria at some point in their lifetime, with 0.5-1% of the population suffering from the disease at any point in time, suggesting a point prevalence of over 1.5 million patients in the United States. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with urticaria are women. Many patients are first provided H1 antihistamine therapy when diagnosed with urticaria; however, there remains a large unmet need. Approximately 50% of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients continue to experience itch and hives despite H1 antihistamine treatment at FDA-approved doses. There have been no new approved therapies to treat chronic urticaria in eight years, and the most recently approved treatment, the injectable biologic Xolair, provided complete hive and itch symptom relief to approximately 36% of patients in clinical trials. We believe Xolair is currently addressing less than 20% of eligible patients whose symptoms have failed to be controlled by H1 antihistamine therapy. There is a clear unmet need for chronic urticaria treatments that provide higher levels of complete hive and itch symptom relief, while also providing improved patient comfort and convenience via an oral route of administration. We believe an oral therapy offers clear advantages over an injectable therapy, and an oral therapy with the potential to improve upon the results of the existing standard of care offers a significant opportunity to address a large unmet need. While the potential market opportunity within urticaria alone is vast, dysfunctional mast cell activity has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of a broad range of inflammatory disorders, including respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, in nonclinical studies, THB001 has demonstrated the ability to deplete mast cells across different tissue types, which we believe supports the ability for an oral small molecule KIT inhibitor to potentially treat a range of mast cell mediated skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions.

 Overview of Mast Cells and KIT
 Mast Cells and Their Role in Immunity
 Mast cells derive from KIT-positive hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow and are present throughout the body in connective and vascularized tissues, most prominently along surface boundaries with exposure to the external environment such as the skin, the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract. Their numerous physiological functions include regulation of inflammation, vasodilation, vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis as well as involvement in the control of other elements of the immune response. Dysfunctional mast cell activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a broad range of mast cell driven inflammatory disorders, including urticaria, asthma and gastrointestinal disorders, among others.
 The cytoplasm of mast cells stores inflammatory mediators including histamine, the proteolytic enzyme tryptase, and various cytokines including interleukins IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-a, or TNF-a. Mast cells express multiple cell-surface receptors, one of which is FceR that has particularly high affinity for immunoglobin E, or IgE, antibodies. As shown in the figure below, upon the stimulation of IgE, change of temperature, or pressure, a signaling cascade leads to activation of the mast cell and its degranulation resulting in the release of tryptase, histamine and other inflammatory mediators. In addition to IgE dependent activation, other IgE independent stimuli can also trigger mast cell activation. The release of inflammatory mediators can manifest into a broad range of allergic or inflammatory diseases. Moreover, mast cell activation and degranulation lead to the recruitment of other progenitor cells to the specific tissue site and the propagation of the inflammatory response.
 Mast cells mediate multiple pro-inflammatory activities


In the skin, antigens activate mast cells in the deep layers of connective tissue triggering the release of histamine and other vasoactive molecules, and causing allergic reactions, including urticaria. In chronic urticaria, patients will develop wheals, together with the sensations of pain and itch. If antigens activate mast cells deeper in the tissue this can lead to angioedema. Another chronic skin disorder involving mast cells is atopic dermatitis, or eczema.


In the respiratory tract, mucosal mast cells in the nasal epithelium are activated by inhaled antigens, eliciting an immune response and resulting in airway constriction, increased mucous production and cough. Mast cells also play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma which is caused by an inflammatory response in the airways due to inhaled antigens that get into the lower respiratory tract and cause mast cell degranulation and local inflammation. This leads to symptoms characteristic of asthma including increased vascular permeability, fluid accumulation, edema, bronchial constriction and obstruction of airways.
 In the gastrointestinal tract, dietary proteins can act as antigens and activate the immune system in affected individuals. Antigens permeate the epithelial layer of the mucosa of the gut and bind to IgE antibodies on mucosal mast cells. Elevated numbers of activated mast cells have been observed in allergic eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, including eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis. Mast cells are also involved in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome and, inflammatory bowel disease, including driving symptomology via their close interaction with nerves.
 KIT Signaling in Mast Cells is a Central Node for Therapeutic Intervention
 The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, also known as CD117, is recognized as a master regulator of mast cell activity. Under normal physiological conditions, mast cell progenitors circulate in an immature form and only fully develop into mature mast cells upon migration to a specific tissue type. Mature mast cells remain localized to a designated destination. The figure below shows the KIT structure on the mast cell membrane. As shown below, stem cell factor, or SCF, which is also referred as the c-kit ligand, binds to KIT on the surface of the mast cell, enables signal transduction into the mast cell and activates the KIT-mediated signaling cascade critical to mast cell survival, propagation and differentiation via pathways such as PLCg, JAK2/STAT, PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK.
 KIT (CD117) is the master regulator of mast cell function and survival



As the master regulator of mast cell function and survival, we believe that the KIT-SCF signaling axis is the optimal intervention point to treat many mast cell mediated diseases. Inhibition of KIT drives both mast cell inactivation and depletion, independent of mast cell activation status.
 Consistent with our nonclinical findings, significant clinical and nonclinical data that have been generated by us and by third-party organizations support KIT as an attractive therapeutic target for mast cell regulation. The multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which is sold under the brand name Gleevec, has been approved by the FDA to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, among other indications. In clinical results by a third party published in The New England Journal of Medicine, daily imatinib, which has demonstrated KIT inhibitory activity, achieved a 43% reduction in plasma levels of serum tryptase, a biomarker used to assess mast cell activation, for patients with severe refractory asthma, which resulted in statistically significant improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness at 24 weeks. We believe these results provide compelling clinical proof-of-concept that mast cell reduction may drive meaningful symptomatic relief. Furthermore, a third party reported that an anti-KIT antibody demonstrated compelling clinical responses in patients with chronic inducible urticaria in a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by a third party.
 Therapeutic Modulation of the Allergic Response
 There are several approved therapeutics used to treat allergy and related inflammatory conditions by targeting specific mediators released by mast cells upon degranulation, including histamines, leukotrienes, cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-a. However, we believe targeting the mast cell directly provides a broader approach to addressing mast cell mediated diseases over only targeting an individual mediator. Due to the involvement of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, mast cell mediator inhibitors often require use in combination with another treatment modality. As a result, single agent inhibition of individual mast cell mediators, such as the H1 antihistamine, do not provide adequate symptomatic relief to a large proportion of the patient population.
 Under current standard of care, patients whose disease does not respond to mediator inhibition, are often candidates for anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, designed to inhibit IgE-driven mast cell activation. While IgE blockade has demonstrated some clinical benefit in the treatment of a range of mast cell mediated inflammatory disorders, anti-IgE therapy does not fully remedy symptoms for most patients, potentially in part because it does not address IgE-independent pathways of mast cell activation. Omalizumab, the anti-IgE mAb sold under the brand name Xolair, is approved for the treatment of persistent allergic asthma, nasal polyps and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Omalizumab generated an estimated $3.5 billion in 2021 sales worldwide.
 Despite current treatment options, there remains a significant unmet need. The targeting of the mast cell directly represents a novel therapeutic approach to address inflammatory diseases. While this approach benefits from clinical validation, advancing the development of therapeutics designed to directly reduce mast cell activity has been thwarted by the potential risk of off-target adverse effects.
 Overview of Urticaria
 Urticaria, which is also referred to as “hives”, is a common inflammatory disorder that has a lifetime prevalence of up to 25% with females twice as likely to experience the condition as men. Onset peaks between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. It is not a single disease but a reaction pattern that represents cutaneous mast cell degranulation. Mast cell degranulation and the release of vasoactive mediators, primarily histamine, results in extravasation of plasma into the dermis, forming the characteristic hives and edematous pruritic pink wheals of various shape and size.
 While the majority of urticaria cases involve acute episodes which are self-limiting and of a short duration, patients with chronic urticaria experience constant or frequently recurring lesions for six or more weeks regularly over months if not years. Chronic urticaria has a negative impact on patients’ quality of life, particularly as the occurrence of angioedema often leads to significant discomfort. Patients have reported an impact on facets of everyday life that include lack of quality sleep, recreation and social interaction, mobility, rest and work. As such, patients with chronic urticaria frequently exhibit psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. At any time, 0.5-1% of the population suffers from chronic urticaria, suggesting a point prevalence of over 1.5 million patients in the United States. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with urticaria are women. The duration of the disease is generally 1-5 years but is likely to be longer in more severe cases.


Chronic urticaria is comprised of two distinct disease types, inducible urticaria and spontaneous urticaria, which was previously referred to as idiopathic urticaria. Chronic inducible urticaria is caused by exposure to specific triggers, which include excessive cold or heat, the application of pressure and exercise. No underlying cause or underlying disease process has been identified in the majority of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. In patients with no identified trigger, the rate of spontaneous remission at 1 year is approximately 20% to 50%, while 30% of moderate to severe patients suffer from chronic urticaria for more than 5 years.
 Current Treatments for Chronic Urticaria
 Current chronic urticaria treatment guidelines recommend first line treatment with second generation H1 antihistamines to provide hive and itch symptom control. For those patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled following first line therapy, second line treatment is initiated with either elevated doses (up to fourfold) of second generation H1 antihistamines or the addition of another class of agent including first generation H1 antihistamines. For the approximately 50% of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients who remain uncontrolled following second line therapy, Xolair is approved as third line therapy. In clinical trials, Xolair reported complete response rates of approximately 36% in chronic spontaneous urticaria and is estimated to address less than 20% of eligible patients whose symptoms have failed to be controlled by H1 antihistamine therapy. As such, there remains a large population of patients that have unmet need.
Our Solution: Next Generation KIT Inhibitors
 Summary
 We are developing next-generation, potentially highly potent and selective, small molecule wild-type KIT inhibitors for the treatment of mast cell-mediated inflammatory diseases. Based on nonclinical and available clinical data to date, we believe an oral small molecule may be differentiated from other KIT-targeting therapeutics in the following designed aspects:
 •The small molecule modality is anticipated to provide more refined dose titration capabilities than anti-KIT mAbs.
 •Oral administration offers improved patient convenience while avoiding mAb-related injection events.
 •Potentially higher selectivity for wild-type KIT relative to other commercial KIT inhibitors such as imatinib.
 •Our oral small molecule inhibitors of KIT bind intracellularly to an inactive conformation of KIT, avoiding the risk of paradoxical mast cell activation that can result from a KIT mAb binding to the extracellular portion of the KIT receptor.
 Although we discontinued the Phase 1b clinical trial of THB001 in chronic urticaria, we expect that data generated from the trial, along with data generated from our previously completed Phase 1a clinical trial, will be useful for the development of our next-generation, highly selective, oral KIT inhibitors.
 In our Phase 1a clinical trial, THB001 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of serum tryptase, a key biomarker of mast cell activity which has been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in chronic urticaria patients.
 Phase 1a Healthy Volunteer Trial
 We conducted a three-part, 84 subject, Phase 1a clinical trial of THB001 in healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65. The primary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives include characterizing pharmacokinetics, including in the presence or absence of food to inform further clinical and drug product formulation development and to measure the pharmacodynamic effect by serum tryptase. The first part of this trial was a single-ascending dose, or SAD, involving five cohorts of up to ten participants assigned to receive a single dose of THB001 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Doses ranged from 10 mg to 600 mg across the five cohorts. The second part of the trial was designed to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics, or PK, profile of 200 mg THB001. A single 200 mg dose was administered to one cohort of ten participants, half of which received THB001 along with a standardized high-fat breakfast, while the other half received THB001 in a fasted state. Following a washout period of at least 7 days, each participant crossed over to receive THB001 in the alternate fed or fasted state. Safety and tolerability of THB001, together with its PK profile was evaluated during this portion of the trial. Upon completion of this second part of the Phase 1a trial, a sixth SAD cohort was added enabling the evaluation of a 400 mg THB001 dose when administered together with food. The third part of the Phase 1a trial was a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, format of four eight-subject cohorts, administered THB001 over 14 consecutive days. The first cohort received 200 mg of THB001 QD, the second cohort received 200 mg of THB001 BID, the third cohort received 400 mg THB001 BID, and the fourth cohort received 500 mg QD administered with a standardized non-high fat breakfast to further characterize the effect of food on the PK of THB001. A schema of our Phase 1a trial is presented below.


Schema of our Phase 1a trial in healthy volunteers.
 

Phase 1a Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Biomarker Data in Healthy Volunteers
 In the SAD portion of the Phase 1a trial, we observed approximately dose proportional increases in serum concentration of THB001 between the 10 mg and 300 mg doses. As reflected in the chart below at 300 mg and higher dosing levels, THB001 concentration exceeded 100 ng/ml through 24 hours, which is the level needed to achieve a KIT half-maximal inhibitory concentration, or IC50, between daily doses. This is consistent with the observed mean half-life of THB001 of approximately 24 hours. Administration of THB001 in combination with food was also noted to enhance exposure approximately three-fold.
 SAD pharmacokinetics in doses up to 600 mg
 
In the MAD portion of the trial, the increase in THB001 dosage from 200 mg BID to 400 mg BID was observed to generate approximately dose proportional increases in THB001 serum concentration levels which provided a trough value difference between THB001 and the protein binding adjusted KIT IC50 of approximately 20-fold, which provides evidence of attractive therapeutic exposure. Administration of 500 mg QD with a standardized non-high fat breakfast produced a PK profile that was similar to the 200 mg BID dose administered in the fasted state, confirming the positive effect of food on THB001 exposure.

200/400 mg BID and 500 mg QD dosing of THB001 generated through serum concentrations which exceeded the IC50
 

Dose levels of 200 mg per day or greater, given QD or BID, were observed to result in dose dependent declines in serum tryptase concentrations, a key biomarker of mast cell activity which has been demonstrated to correlate with clinical benefit in chronic urticaria, as compared to placebo, or PBO, as reflected in the graph below.
 Twice-daily administration of THB001 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in serum tryptase levels.
 


As reflected in the chart presented below, which shows absolute serum tryptase levels in patients over time, twice daily dosing of the higher 400 mg level of THB001 resulted in mean serum tryptase which was at the lower limit of quantification.
 The higher 400 mg BID dose resulted in a serum tryptase level at the lower limit of quantitation.
 

Mast Cell-Mediated Diseases Addressable by KIT Inhibition
 Dysfunctional mast cell activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a broad range of inflammatory disorders that impact the skin, eye, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Given KIT is the master regulator of mast cell function and survival, we believe that KIT inhibition is the optimal approach to treat many of these mast cell mediated diseases.
 Related to the skin and eye, potential indications addressable with KIT inhibition include chronic urticaria, systemic sclerosis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
 In the respiratory tract, potential indications addressable with KIT inhibition include asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, or CRSwNP.
 In the gastrointestinal tract, potential indications addressable with KIT inhibition include irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, eosinophilic esophagitis and food allergy.


Examples of selected mast cell mediated diseases potentially addressable with KIT inhibition
 
An oral KIT inhibitor's Therapeutic Potential in Other Mast Cell Driven Inflammatory Diseases
 Nonclinical studies of THB001 provide evidence of the ability for an oral KIT inhibitor to deplete and inhibit mast cell activity in multiple species and tissue types. Significant therapeutic improvement has also been observed in animal disease models.
 In a 14-day repeat dose study of THB001 conducted in dogs, samples were collected from the skin both before and after administration of the drug candidate and evaluated for mast cell counts. As is reflected in the results presented below, we observed a dose-dependent decline in mean skin mast cell count in every treated animal. Statistical significance is important and when used herein is denoted by p-values. The p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance (for example, a p-value < 0.001 means that there is a less than 0.1% chance that the observed change was purely due to chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant.


THB001 generated dose-dependent mast cell depletion in a 14-day repeat dose study in dogs.
 

In a rat model of allergic asthma conducted by Novartis, THB001 also demonstrated robust in vivo activity, with improvements in early airway response, or EAR, and reduction in the lung mast cell specific gene signature by approximately 50% or greater. The degranulation of mast cells is the main contributor in the early phase allergic response upon antigen exposure and accordingly, inhibition of mast cell survival and function by prevention of KIT activation is expected to result in the improvement of allergic symptoms.
 In this study, animals received OVA antigen to stimulate allergic reaction in the lung with the exception of one cohort receiving saline. The OVA antigen treated animals were administered either a 3 mg/kg, or mpk, 5 mpk or 10 mpk dose of THB001 twice daily for seven days and compared to animals administered vehicle alone. As is reflected in the experimental results presented in the chart below, THB001 produced a dose dependent, statistically significant therapeutic response, with measures of lung function enhanced pause, or Penh, used to assess changes in the shape of airflow pattern entering and leaving the animal, displaying notable improvement with increased KIT inhibition. Moreover, at the lowest level administered to the animals, 3 mg/kg BID, the serum concentration of THB001 exceeded the in vitro protein binding adjusted KIT IC50 over the dosing period, providing evidence of adequate sustained suppression of KIT-mediated signaling activity.

The use of THB001 produced statistically significant airway improvements in a rat model of allergic asthma.
 

Gene expression profiles provided further support of THB001’s inhibition of mast cell activity. Expression patterns for mast cell associated genes were evaluated after administration of the various dose levels of THB001 relative to expression levels observed after dosing with vehicle. These expression profiles revealed that at approximately one-half the expression levels seen after administration of vehicle, which was achieved at the lower dosing level of 3 mpk, the animals began to benefit from significant airway improvement. These results suggest that modulation to some intermediate inhibitory level that is less than complete inhibition of mast cell activity may provide meaningful clinical benefit. The analysis of the gene expression profiles is outlined in the chart below.

 The Therapeutic Benefit of an Oral KIT Inhibitor May Extend to a Range of Tissues
 We are exploring development opportunities across a range of other indications where an oral KIT inhibitor may provide benefit to patients suffering from mast cell driven inflammation. We believe that KIT inhibition may provide wide therapeutic utility across other indications as mast cells are present in numerous tissue types with external exposures. In addition to skin, where chronic urticaria represents our initial clinical indication, there are multiple respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions including eosinophilic esophagitis and asthma, where we believe mast cells maintain a vital role in driving the pathophysiology of the disease. We believe these potential additional opportunities represent attractive markets with established development and regulatory pathways, for which there remains a large unmet need.
 For example, approximately five to ten percent of asthma patients suffer from severe asthma, or an estimated 750,000 to one million patients in the United States alone.


In a nine-day repeat dose rat pharmacology study, THB001 demonstrated the ability to potently deplete mast cells across all tissues tested. As is noted in the chart below, in tissue taken from the oral cavity (tongue tissue) and the small intestine (ileum and jejunum tissue), there was statistically significant mast cell suppression following administration of THB001.
 THB001 demonstrated mass cell depletion across a range of tissue types.

Manufacturing
 We oversee and manage third-party Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations, or CDMOs, for development and manufacture of future development candidates.
 We used two geographically-distributed CDMOs to supply THB001 GMP drug substance. The manufacturing process is robust with readily-sourced commercially available raw materials and straightforward scalability. The drug substance demonstrates excellent room temperature stability, and all batch releases have met all phase-appropriate specifications.
 We used three geographically-distributed CDMOs for THB001 drug product manufacturing. The THB001 drug product is a cost-effective and readily scaled solid oral dosage form in standard gelatin capsules. More than 100,000 capsules have been produced to date, which meet all release specifications. Excellent room temperature stability has been established for the THB001 drug product.
 As of January 2023, we paused all manufacturing activities on THB001. For our future development candidates, we plan to continue operations with these existing manufacturing CDMOs to support toxicology and clinical studies. Additional manufacturing CDMOs may be on-boarded at later stages of clinical and commercial development.
 Competition
 We face substantial competition from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge within the field of immunology and, furthermore, within the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions.
 In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients with mast cell driven inflammatory diseases, numerous commercial and academic nonclinical studies and clinical trials are being undertaken by a large number of parties to assess novel technologies and product candidates. There are numerous other competitive approaches, including inhibitors of activators of mast cells such as IgE antibodies like omalizumab, inhibitors of mediators such as anti-histamines and anti-IL-4 /IL-13 therapies, other small molecule approaches such as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and other small molecule and biologic KIT inhibitors, including Celldex’s CDX-0159, a monoclonal antibody KIT inhibitor, among others.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or in combination with their respective strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through sizeable collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retain qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offering. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be product safety, efficacy, convenience and treatment cost.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through inclusion in expedited development and review, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.


As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending any such patents against third-party challenges and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates will depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The terms of individual patents depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the subject drug candidate is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any issued patents we may obtain in any jurisdiction where such patent term extensions are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment that such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In some instances, we have submitted and expect to submit patent applications directly to the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
 We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Office. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing.
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We seek to file patents containing claims for protection of useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to pursue maximum coverage and value for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.


The ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future oral KIT inhibitor product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 When available to expand market exclusivity, our strategy is to obtain, or license additional intellectual property related to current or contemplated development platforms, core elements of technology and/or clinical candidates.
 As of February 9, 2023, our overall patent portfolio contains eleven patent families that collectively contain issued patents, pending provisional and non-provisional U.S. patent applications, PCT international patent applications, and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions.

Government Regulation
 Regulation Within the United States
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, and ethics committee for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1a, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including: (i) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible; or (ii) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.


After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fees for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months of the date of submission of the NDA to the FDA; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months of the date of submission of the NDA to the FDA. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. With certain exceptions, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution.


The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period of exclusivity if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. The FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the exclusivity period.
Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside of the United States require that clinical trial applications be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the United States before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process and requirements vary from country to country, so the number and type of nonclinical, clinical, and manufacturing studies needed may differ, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Non-Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.


Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the ICH guidelines on GCP as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries member states, the sponsor is liable to provide “no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Marketing Authorization
 To obtain marketing approval of a product under the EU regulatory system, we are mandated to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. The centralized procedure, which came into operation in 1995, allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, designated orphan medicinal products, ATMPs such as gene therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the EU before May 20, 2004 (date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004) and which are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the EU before May 20, 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or for which the granting of authorization is in the interests of patients at the EU level. The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a MAA is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs.
 When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the EMA to be assessed by the CHMP. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the assessment of whether a medicine meets the required quality, safety, and efficacy requirements, and whether the product has a positive risk/benefit profile. The centralized procedure, as described below, culminates with a decision by the European Commission, which is valid in all EU member states. Centrally authorized products may be marketed in all member states.
 Full copies of the MAAs are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA’s scientific assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MAA has been granted.


The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant’s replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP, and taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it will include the draft summary of the product’s characteristics, the package leaflet, and the texts proposed for the various packaging materials. The time limit for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops). The EMA has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the European Commission. This is the start of the second phase of the procedure: the decision-making process. The EMA sends to the European Commission its opinion and assessment report, together with annexes containing: the SmPC (Annex 1); the particulars of the MAH responsible for batch release, the particulars of the manufacturer of the active substance, and the conditions of the marketing authorization (Annex 2); and the labeling and the package leaflet (Annex 3). The annexes are translated into the 22 other official languages of the EU. During the decision-making process, the European Commission services verify that the marketing authorization complies with EU law. The European Commission has fifteen days to prepare a draft decision. The medicinal product is assigned an EU registration number, which will be placed on its packaging if the marketing authorization is granted. During this period, various European Commission directorates-general are consulted on the draft marketing authorization decision.
 The draft decision is then sent to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, (member states have one representative in the Standing Committees on Medicinal Products for Human Use) for its opinions. The Centralized Procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The Decentralized Procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to the public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 MAAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Under the Centralized Procedure and in exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops).
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving a MAA, reference product candidates generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MAA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MAA of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MAA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 In the EU, there is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.


Pediatric Development
 A Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, in the EU is aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All MAAs for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines are available in the EU. Medicines authorized across the EU with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months (if any is in effect at the time of authorization). This is the case even when the studies’ results are negative. For orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization, or PUMA. If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from ten years of market protection as an incentive.
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, The Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, to facilitate development of product candidates that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MAA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MAA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAA must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk- minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.


EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”. However, new legislation such as the EU CTR will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an “appropriate authority” to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
 As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain, or GB. Broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a guidance on how various aspects of the UK regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, importing, exporting, and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development, or commercialization of medicines in the UK. The new guidance was given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, or the Exit Regulations. The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MAA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MAA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore after Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAAs. In order to obtain a UK MAA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be established in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to obtain a MAA to commercialize products in the UK. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new (centralized procedure) MAA when determining an application for a GB authorization or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in GB.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and health information privacy laws and other healthcare laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or ACA, amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act.
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.


Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the Civil Monetary Penalties Law statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, their covered subcontractors and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA.
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data are made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 Analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Further, certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, we may also be subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, such as California’s CCPA or Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable state, federal and foreign healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.


Healthcare Reform
 Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. Healthcare reform initiatives recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in August 2022, which will eliminate, beginning in 2025, the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA also allow HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price representing a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. The law will also, beginning in October 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 2023 for Medicare Part B, penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Patients in the U.S. and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, market acceptance of any future oral KIT inhibitor product candidates, if approved, will be dependent on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from third-party payors, including government health program administration authorities (including in connection with government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid), private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. Coverage and reimbursement policies for products can differ significantly from payor to payor, as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products among commercial third-party payors in the United States. There also may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement, as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and can require health care providers to provide clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained. In addition, the increased emphasis by such third-party payors and government authorities in the United States on managed care and cost containment measures will continue to place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for any future oral KIT inhibitor product candidates, if approved, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
