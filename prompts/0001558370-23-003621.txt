ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History and Organization
McEwen Mining Inc. (the “Company”) is a gold and silver mining production and exploration company with an advanced copper development project, focused on the Americas. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Colorado in 1979 as US Gold Corp. In September 2011, US Gold Corp. acquired Minera Andes Inc., and was renamed McEwen Mining Inc. We own 100% of the Froome mine and Stock mill in Ontario, Canada, a 100% interest in the Gold Bar mine in Nevada, 100% of the Fenix Project in Sinaloa, Mexico, 68.1% of McEwen Copper Inc., the owner of the Los Azules copper project (“Los Azules”) in San Juan, Argentina, and a 49% interest in MSC, the owner and operator of the San José mine in Santa Cruz, Argentina. MSC is controlled by the majority owner of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc (“Hochschild”). In addition to the above, we hold interests in advanced-stage and exploration-stage properties and projects in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina. 
Our commencement of Canadian operations in 2017 was facilitated by the acquisition of Lexam VG Gold Inc. (“Lexam”) in April 2017, followed by the acquisition of the Black Fox Property and Stock Property from Primero Mining Corp. in October 2017. These two acquisitions provided us with an operating mine, mill and significant land interests in the historic Timmins mining district of Ontario (collectively, the “Fox Complex”). On September 19, 2021, our currently operating Froome mine, located within the Black Fox Property, reached commercial production.
In the United States, construction began on our 100% owned Gold Bar mine in Nevada in 2017. The Gold Bar mine poured its first gold ingot on February 16, 2019 and achieved commercial production on May 23, 2019. Current production is from our Pick and Ridge deposits, and in December 2022 we began mining from our Gold Bar South (“GBS”) deposit.
At the El Gallo mine in Sinaloa, Mexico, mining and crushing activities ceased during the second quarter of 2018, with production activities since that time limited to residual leaching up to the third quarter of 2022. The Company is currently reviewing reprocessing heap leach material at the El Gallo mine (“HLM”) as well as new silver processing operations (“El Gallo Silver”) in the immediate vicinity as part of its Fenix Project.
In July 2021, we announced the creation of McEwen Copper Inc. (“McEwen Copper”), through which we hold an indirect interest in Los Azules in the province of San Juan, Argentina and the Elder Creek exploration property in Nevada. During 2021 and 2022, we closed a $81.9 million private placement offering for a 31.9% interest in McEwen Copper, which included a $40 million investment by an affiliate of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert McEwen.
Our objective is to increase shareholder value through the exploration for and economic extraction of gold, silver and other valuable minerals. Other than the San José mine in Argentina, we generally conduct our activities as the sole operator, but we may enter into strategic arrangements with other companies through joint venture or similar agreements. We hold our mineral property interests and operate our business through various subsidiary companies, each of which is owned directly, or indirectly, by us.
Our principal executive office is located at 150 King Street West, Suite 2800, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 1J9 and our telephone number is (866) 441-0690. We also maintain offices in Elko, Nevada (U.S.), Matheson, Canada, Guamúchil, Mexico, and San Juan, Argentina. Our website is www.mcewenmining.com. We make available at no cost our periodic reports including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and news releases and certain of our corporate governance documents, including our Code of Ethics, on our website. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “MUX.” 
In this report, unless otherwise noted, “Au” represents gold; “Ag” represents silver; “Cu” represents copper; “oz” represents troy ounce; “lb” represents pound; “g/t” represents grams per metric tonne; “o/t” represents troy ounces per short ton; “ft” represents feet; “m” represents meter; “sq” represents square; and C$ refers to Canadian dollars. All our financial information is reported in United States (U.S.) dollars, unless otherwise noted. References to our company include, where the context requires, all of our subsidiaries, including our 68.1% interest in McEwen Copper Inc.

Segment Information
Our operating segments include Canada, United States, Mexico, MSC and McEwen Copper. Financial information for each of our reportable segments can be found under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, Operating Segment Reporting. 
Products
The end product at our gold and silver operations is generally in the form of doré or concentrate. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold and silver but may also contain other trace elements. Doré is sent to third party refiners to produce saleable bullion. Ore concentrate, or simply concentrate, is raw mineralized material that has been finely ground into a powdery product from which gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. Concentrate, as well as slag and fine carbons (which are by-products of the gold production process), are sent to third party smelters for further recovery of gold and silver.
​
During 2022, production consisted of 100% doré from the Gold Bar mine, 99% doré and 1% slag and fine carbon from the Fox Complex, and 92% doré and 8% slag and fine carbon from the El Gallo mine. Production from the San José mine consisted of 55% doré and 45% concentrate. 
​
During 2022, we reported the following consolidated production attributable to us:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

(1) | Calculated using an average silver to gold ratio of 84:1.
----+----------------------------------------------------------

Gold and silver contained in our end products are generally sold at the prevailing spot market price per ounce at the time of sale. Concentrates produced by the San José mine are provisionally priced, whereby the selling price is subject to final adjustments at the end of a period ranging from 30 to 90 days after delivery to the customer. The final price is based on the market price of the contained metals at the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract. Due to the time elapsed between shipment and the final settlement with the buyer, MSC estimates the prices at which sales of metals will be settled. At the end of each financial reporting period, previously recorded provisional sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices based on relevant forward market prices until final settlement with the buyer.
During 2022, revenues from gold and silver sales were $47.9 million from the Gold Bar mine, $60.8 million from the Fox Complex, $1.6 million from the El Gallo mine, and $124.8 million from the San José mine on a 49% basis. Revenue from the San José mine is not included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) as we use the equity method of accounting for MSC. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding production and operating results for our properties, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Investments and Note 9, Investment in Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”) – San José Mine for additional information regarding the equity method of accounting.

​
On March 10, 2023, the London P.M. Fix for gold was $1,861.25 per ounce and the London Fix for silver was $20.09 per ounce.
Processing Methods
At our operations, gold and silver are extracted from mineralized material by either milling or heap leaching depending on, among other things, the amount of gold and silver contained in the material, whether the material is naturally oxidized or not, and the amenability of the material to treatment. 
At our Froome mine in Canada, mineralized material from the underground mine is transported to our Stock mill and fed to a crushing circuit. Final sized product is then leached with cyanide, and gold-cyanide in solution is recovered to activated carbon. The gold is stripped from the carbon and recovered with electrowinning cells, after which the gold is poured into doré bars.
At the Gold Bar mine and the previously operating El Gallo mine, both open pit operations, the mineralized material is processed using heap leaching methods. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed, oxidized material on impermeable pads, where a diluted cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to extract the contained gold and silver content. The gold and silver-bearing solution is then recovered through adsorption onto activated carbon, followed by desorption, electrowinning, retorting and finally smelting into doré bars.
At the San José mine, mineralized material from the underground mine is processed initially using a conventional crushing-grinding-flotation mill. A portion of the flotation concentrate is cyanide leached followed by an electrowinning which produces a precipitate. This precipitate is then smelted and poured into silver and gold doré bars. The remainder of the concentrate is shipped to third-party smelters for toll processing.
Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves
We had attributable estimated proven and probable gold reserves of 0.3 million ounces of gold at our Gold Bar mine and the San José mine, and 5.1 million ounces of proven and probable silver reserves at the San José mine at December 31, 2022.
A “mineral reserve” is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of measured and indicated mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. The term “economically viable,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that the qualified person has analytically determined that extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “proven reserves” means the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough

to assume continuity between points of observation. Proven and probable reserves include gold and silver attributable to our ownership or economic interest.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold or silver will be realized. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold or silver, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing higher cost reserves uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used.
Proven and probable reserves disclosed at December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared in accordance with the Regulation S-K 1300 requirements of the SEC.
The following tables summarize the estimated proven and probable gold and silver reserves attributable to our ownership or economic interest as of December 31, 2022:

Notes to the 2022 Mineral Reserve tables
Gold Bar mine
Mineral reserves equal the total ore planned for processing from the mine plan based on a $1,650/oz gold price. Mineral reserves are based on the following economic input parameters: $4.97/ average ore tonne mining cost, $3.35/ average waste tonne mining cost, $5.41/ore tonne crushed process cost, $4.13/ average ore tonne run-of-mine (“ROM”) process cost, $3.06/ average ore tonne general and administrative (“G&A”) cost, $0.475/oz gold refining charge, $1.538/oz transport & sales cost, 99.95% payable gold, and a 1% royalty at GBS only.
The stated mineral reserves are based on a variable cut-off grade (“COG”) based on rock type, mining area, carbon content, clay content and process response. The grades reported from Pick and Ridge include a mining dilution based on the surrounding block grades. Mineral reserves are contained within an engineered pit design between the $1,250/oz and $1,400/oz gold sales price Lerchs-Grossman pit shells, based on end of November 2022 topography.
The metal price used ($1,650) for mineral reserves reflects a conservative combination of a recent trailing average sourced from Kitco’s Historic Price data and a consensus forecast via Bloomberg. Recoveries are variable and as follows: 78% crushed oxide recovery at Pick and Ridge, 72% ROM oxide recovery at Pick and Ridge, 61% ROM oxide recovery at Gold Bar South, and 0% ROM mid-carbon recovery. COGs are variable and based on the presence or not of clay content, carbon content and recoveries and range from 0.0065 o/t to 0.0121 o/t. The reference point for the mineral reserves is at the primary crusher.
The following changes have impacted mineral reserves during 2022: Mining depletion at Pick and Gold Bar South; operating costs increase largely driven by an increase in mining costs; revised interpretation of the mineralization and geological model, project costs were re-estimated based on current mining activity and new contractor quotes; an update to the mining schedule based on the costs.
San José mine
Mineral reserves are reported at McEwen’s 49% attributable interest. Hochschild hold a 51% interest in San José.
COG is reported in silver equivalent grams per tonne, calculated using a ratio of 75:1 Ag:Au. For mineral reserves, the silver equivalent COG is: cut & fill 311 g/t silver equivalent, long hole 250 g/t silver equivalent.
Mineral reserves as presented are in place and include average internal dilution of 6%, average mining and geotechnical dilution of 51%, and mine extraction of 29%, but do not include allowances for mill or smelter recoveries. For the 2022 mineral reserves estimate, inaccessible mineral resources that contained insufficient tonnages to permit the development of local infrastructure, mineral resources in mined out/isolated areas, mineral resources located in sill and rib pillars and operationally lost mineral resources were not included in the mineral reserves estimate.
The December 31, 2022 mineral reserves estimate was based on a gold price of $1,650/oz and a silver price of $22/oz. P&E determined that these metal prices are suitable to be utilized for mineral reserve estimation since they are based on recognized consensus forecast metal prices. 
Ongoing definition, delineation and mine exploration drilling will lead to better definition of existing resources or extensions of known veins that will be reflected on the year-on-year comparison of both mineral reserves. Mine depletion, commodity price changes and equivalents leading to cut-off grade changes will also have an effect on the comparative data.
Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources
​
We had attributable estimated measured and indicated mineral resources of 3.3 million ounces of gold, 58.9 million ounces of silver, and 3.1 million tonnes (or 6.9 billion pounds) of copper at December 31, 2022. We had attributable estimated inferred mineral resources of 3.3 million ounces of gold, 105.6 million ounces of silver, and 5.9 million tonnes (or 13.1 billion pounds) of copper at December 31, 2022.

The measured, indicated, and inferred resource figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation and are exclusive of reserves. A “mineral resource” is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade, or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. The reference point for mineral resources is in situ. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories. Ounces of gold and silver or pounds of copper and molybdenum included in the measured, indicated and inferred resources are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. The terms "measured resource," "indicated resource," and "inferred resource" mean that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of geological evidence and sampling that is considered to be comprehensive, adequate, or limited, respectively.
​
We publish measured, indicated and inferred resources annually, considering metal prices, changes, if any, to future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions. Measured, indicated, and inferred resources disclosed at December 31, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the new Regulation S-K 1300 requirements of the SEC.

Notes to the 2022 Mineral Resource tables
Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any part of the mineral resources estimated will be converted into a mineral reserves estimate. The numbers in the tables have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimates and may not sum due to rounding. The inferred mineral resource in these estimates has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the inferred mineral resource could be upgraded to an indicated mineral resource with continued exploration.
Underground mineral resources include the ‘must take’ minor material below cut-off grade within the potentially mineable shape optimizer stopes that are generated by above-cut-off grade blocks.
Canada – Fox Complex
Mineral resources for the Froome mine are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 2.35 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of C$80/t, process cost of C$24.34/t, G&A cost of C$10.50/t, haulage cost of C$4.70/t, refining cost of C$1.82/oz, metallurgical recovery of 87%, royalty buyout of C$1.21/t, dilution of 15%, and realized gold price of $1,632/oz (after considering the impact of our gold stream with Sandstorm Gold Ltd.).
Mineral resources for Grey Fox are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 2.30 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of C$80/t, process cost of C$24.34/t, G&A cost of C$10.50/t, haulage cost of C$5.64/t, refining cost of C$1.82/oz, metallurgical recovery of 85%, royalty NSR of 2.65%, dilution of 15%, and gold price of $1,725/oz.

Mineral resources for Stock East are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 1.67 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of $60.61/t, process cost of $18.60/t, G&A cost of $7.95/t, metallurgical recovery of 94%, and gold price of $1,725/oz.
The gold price used in estimating mineral resources of $1,725 was based on long-term consensus pricing forecasts published in late 2022. Resources are stated as in-situ. In addition, underground constraining shapes were used to better define reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Froome mine and Stock West used improvements to modeling and estimation methodology and updates based on drilling results. The Froome mine also included changes due to mining depletion.
​
United States - Gold Bar mine
Mineral resources are based on the following economic input parameters: $3.19/ore ton mining cost, $1.99/waste ton mining cost, $4.91/ore ton crushed process cost, $3.77/ore ton ROM process cost, $3.16/ore ton G&A cost, $0.475/oz gold refining charge, $1.538/oz transport & sales cost, 99.95% payable gold, and a 1% royalty (Gold Bar South only). Mineral resources stated are contained within a $1,725/oz gold sales price Lerchs-Grossmann pits based on end of November 2022 topography.
The gold price used in estimating mineral resources of $1,725 was based on long-term consensus pricing forecasts published in late 2022. Resources are reported as in-situ. Recoveries are variable and as follows: 78% crushed oxide recovery at Pick and Ridge, 50% mid-carbon recovery at Pick and Ridge, 72% ROM oxide recovery at Pick and Ridge, 61% ROM oxide recovery at Gold Bar South, 0% ROM mid-carbon recovery. Cut-off grades are variable and based on the presence or not of clay content, carbon content and recoveries.
Changes in mineral resources are due to mining depletion during 2022. The following changes have impacted the project mineral resources: Mining depletion at Pick and Gold Bar South; operating costs increase largely driven by an increase in mining costs; project costs were re-estimated based on current mining activity and new contractor quotes; an update to the mining schedule based on the costs.
​
Mexico – Fenix Project
Gold and silver mineral resources were calculated using metal prices of $1,300/oz and $16/oz, respectively. These prices were based off the 3-year trailing average of the London Closing Fix for 2017-2019 ($1,306 and $16.32) sourced from Kitco’s Historical Data charts.
​
Mineral resources are stated as in situ for El Gallo Silver, and as crushed and stacked, ready for hauling and processing for the El Gallo mine HLM.
​
El Gallo Silver: Milling recovery assumptions of 86% (sulfide) and 75% (oxide) for silver and 86% gold. Mining costs of $1.95/t, processing and G&A costs of $26.15/t milled were used. Mineral resources are stated within an optimized pit shell indicating reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
​
HLM: Because of the unconsolidated nature of the heap leach material, the mine schedule plans to mine the entire heap without the benefit of selectivity. Sub-cut-off leach pad material will inherently have potential acid generating sulfide liabilities if placed in our waste dumps and so it will be prudent to process the entire leach pad and place tailings in a previously mined pit at an overall environmental and economic benefit. Metallurgical recovery assumptions for the HLM are 85% gold and 60% silver.

​
The differences in annual mineral resources at the El Gallo mine are attributed to the heap leach operation. Residual leaching continued through 2022. There was a minor amount of metal recovered of 844 ounces of gold and 616 ounces of silver at the operation in 2022.
​
MSC - San José mine
Mineral resources are reported at McEwen’s 49% attributable interest. Hochschild has a 51% interest in San José. Mineral resources are in situ. 
Cut-off grades are reported in silver equivalent grams per tonne, calculated using a ratio of 75:1 Ag:Au. For mineral resources, the silver equivalent cut-off grades are: 293 g/t silver equivalent.
The December 31, 2022 mineral resource estimate was based on a gold price of $1,800/oz and a silver price of $24/oz. P&E determined that these metal prices are suitable to be utilized for mineral resource estimation since they are based on recognized consensus forecast prices. 
Ongoing definition, delineation and mine exploration drilling will lead to better definition of existing resources or extensions of known veins that will be reflected on the year-on-year comparison of both mineral resources. Mine depletion, commodity price changes and equivalents leading to cut-off grade changes will also have an effect on the comparative data.
McEwen Copper - Los Azules
The mineral resources estimate for Los Azules is reported inside of a pit shell. The parameters assumed are a copper price of $2.75/lb, operating costs of $1.70/t mining, $5.00/t for processing and $1.00/t for G&A, and copper metallurgical recovery of 90%. The mineral resources estimate is reported with a cut-off grade of 0.20% Cu.
Mineral resources are in-situ and are reported at McEwen’s 68.1% attributable interest.
​
Competitive Business Conditions
We compete with many companies in the mining and mineral exploration and production industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel, and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease, or acquisition in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and other areas where we may conduct our mining or exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas that would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources.
Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties, but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such exploration and development. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious and base metals but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in our company not only being unable to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
General Government Regulations
In the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities and concessions 

13



granted under contracts with the host government, there are no third-party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. The applicable laws and regulations applicable to us include but are not limited to:

● | mineral concession rights.
--+---------------------------


● | surface rights.
--+----------------


● | water rights.
--+--------------


● | mining royalties.
--+------------------


● | environmental laws.
--+--------------------


● | mining permits.
--+----------------


● | mining and income taxes.
--+-------------------------


● | health and safety laws and regulations.
--+----------------------------------------


● | labor laws and regulations.
--+----------------------------


● | export regulations.
--+--------------------

We believe that all of our properties are operated in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations.
Reclamation Obligations
Under applicable laws in the jurisdictions where our properties are located, we are required to reclaim disturbances caused by our mining activities. Accordingly, we have recorded estimates in our financial statements for our reclamation obligations, in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”) the most significant of which are related to our properties in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
Estimated future reclamation costs are based primarily on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2022, we accrued $41.8 million for reclamation costs relating to currently developed and producing properties. These amounts are included in Asset Retirement Obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
U.S. Environmental Laws
We are subject to extensive environmental regulation under the laws of the U.S. and the state of Nevada, where our U.S. operations are conducted. For example, certain mining wastes resulting from the extraction and processing of ores would be considered hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state law equivalents, but we are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste. If our mine wastes were treated as hazardous waste under RCRA or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as “Superfund” sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state law equivalents for cleanup, significant expenditures could be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities, for other remediation expenditures, or for natural resource damages. Under CERCLA, any present or past owners or operators of a Superfund site generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owners or operators may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our operations, tailings, and waste disposal areas, as well as upon mine closure under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including, without limitation, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and state law equivalents. See Note 12 to our consolidation financial statements, Reclamation and Remediation Liabilities, for information on reclamation obligations under governmental environmental laws.
We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Future changes in U.S. federal or state laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon us and our results of operations.

Foreign Government Regulations
Canada, where the Fox Complex is located, and Mexico, where the El Gallo mine and Fenix Project are located, have both adopted laws and guidelines for environmental permitting that are similar to those in effect in the U.S. The permitting process requires a thorough study to determine the baseline condition of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of exploration and mining operation activities. We have received all permits required to operate our current activities in Canada and Mexico and have received all permits necessary for the exploration activities being conducted at our non-U.S. properties.
Customers
Production from the Gold Bar mine, the Froome mine, and the El Gallo mine is sold as refined metal on the spot market or doré under the terms set out in doré purchase agreements. 
We have doré purchase agreements with Canadian financial institutions, Asahi Refining (“Asahi”), and with metals trading companies. Under the terms of our doré purchase agreements, we have the option to sell approximately 90% of the gold and silver contained in doré bars produced at the Gold Bar, Froome and El Gallo mines prior to the completion of refining. On July 27, 2022, we entered into a precious metals purchase agreement with Auramet International LLC (“Auramet”). Under this agreement, we have the option to sell the gold on a Spot Basis, on a Forward Basis and on a Supplier Advance basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, in respect of our 100% owned mines, 52% of our sales were made to Asahi, and 46% of our sales were made to Auramet.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, 92% of the total sales from the San José mine were made to three companies: Aurubis AG, a German company, accounted for 15% of the total sales; LS Nikko Copper, a Korean company, accounted for 35% of the total sales and Argor-Heraeus, a Swiss company, accounted for 42% of the total sales. MSC has sales agreements with each of these purchasers. The remaining 8% of San José’s sales are made to a number of customers under smaller contract quantities. 
In the event that our customer relationships or MSC’s customer relationships were interrupted for any reason, we believe that we or MSC could locate other purchasers for our products. However, any interruption may temporarily disrupt the sale of our products and may affect our operating results. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 520 employees, including 75 in the United States, 25 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 193 in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, 84 in Mexico, and 143 in Argentina. All our employees based in Toronto work in an executive, technical or administrative position, while our employees in the United States, Timmins, Mexico, and Argentina include management, laborers, craftsmen, miners, geologists, environmental specialists, information technologists, and various other support roles. As of December 31, 2022, MSC had 1,348 employees in Argentina. We also frequently engage independent contractors in connection with certain administrative matters and the exploration of our properties, such as drillers, geophysicists, geologists, and other specialty technical disciplines. For Canada and United States, we also engage independent contractors for technical and professional expertise as well as extractive and exploration activities such as drilling, geophysics, hauling and crushing. Of our employees in Mexico, 35 are covered by union labor contracts and we believe we have good relations with them.
As part of our fundamental need to attract and retain talent, we regularly evaluate our compensation, benefits and employee wellness offerings. We have determined that our compensation arrangements are competitive in the industry. Over 93% of our U.S. employees are enrolled in our medical benefit plan, over 90% of U.S. employees contribute to our 401(k) plan and 94% of employees in Canada contribute to our Deferred Profit Share Plan. Supplemental healthcare is provided above government requirements in both Canada and Mexico.
