Overview
 MicroStrategy® is a leading worldwide provider of enterprise analytics and mobility software. Our goal is to provide enterprise customers with a world-class software platform and expert services to enable each of our customers to become a more Intelligent Enterprise™. MicroStrategy was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 17, 1989. Today, with operations in 29 countries worldwide, MicroStrategy is one of the largest independent, publicly-traded analytics companies as measured by annual revenue.
 MicroStrategy 2019™
 MicroStrategy 2019, our latest platform release, features HyperIntelligence™, transformational mobility, and federated analytics. MicroStrategy 2019 delivers modern analytics on an enterprise platform that can be deployed on-premises or on multiple private and public cloud platforms. It is designed to make every enterprise a more Intelligent Enterprise by delivering:
 HyperIntelligence. This new category of analytics is designed to transform the way people interact with information and find answers by seamlessly delivering intelligence to more groups of users through zero-click experiences. With the HyperCard™ application, users with Google Chrome can simply hover over a highlighted word on websites and other browser-based applications to instantly bring up relevant, contextual insights on key terms, including employee, customer, and organization names. With HyperIntelligence, users can also leverage APIs to design and deploy artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications that deliver zero-click experiences by integrating with modern third-party technologies and devices, including voice assistants like Alexa or Siri, image recognition software, and GPS applications.
 Transformational mobility. This category of analytical applications is targeted at the increasingly mobile workforce tasked with making decisions and taking action within minutes. MicroStrategy 2019 delivers more ways for organizations to quickly deploy mobile productivity apps for a variety of business functions and roles on any standard device. Users can build apps using one of three powerful strategies: (i) mobile dossiers – to quickly build interactive books of analytics that render beautifully on smartphones and tablets; (ii) no code drag-and-drop – for branded custom apps that mobilize systems, processes, and applications; and (iii) customized development – with software development kits (“SDKs”) for iOS and Android that let developers extend MicroStrategy content into their apps using XCode or JavaScript.
 Federated analytics. This mainstream category of analytics is targeted at analysts and data scientists, who enable long-term decision making.  Whether through dossiers, dashboards, or predictive models, or reporting for project performance, financial statements, or billing, MicroStrategy 2019 is designed to empower users with trusted analytics.  The platform also supports users who access data using their favorite third-party tools or interact with apps or websites that have been enriched with HyperIntelligence. Analysts who use Excel, Power BI, Qlik, or Tableau and data scientists who leverage RStudio or Jupyter Notebook can now boost their productivity by using the MicroStrategy 2019 platform for trusted, scalable, federated analytics.
 MicroStrategy 2019 is an open, API-driven platform powered by our proprietary Enterprise Semantic Graph™, an enriched index that builds on the metadata-based (data about data), centralized architecture that is a core differentiator of our technology. The Enterprise Semantic Graph supplements metadata content and the foundational business glossary with real-time usage information and system and location telemetry, enabling a new generation of AI-driven applications powered by contextual recommendations and personalized insights.

Our channel partners allow us to leverage sales and service resources and marketing and industry-specific expertise to expand our user base and increase our market coverage.
 Marketing
Our marketing programs target the following principal constituencies:
  
• | Our historical base of enterprise-wide operational and technology executives and departmental buyers across large global enterprises;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corporate and departmental technology buyers in mid-sized enterprises;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Government technology buyers and the vendors to the government community;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Independent software vendors that want to embed our technology tools in their solutions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | System integrators that have technology relationships with large enterprises, governments, and information-intensive businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continually seek to increase our brand awareness by focusing our messaging on the possibilities for value creation, the benefits of using our platform, and competitive differentiators. The channels we use to communicate with these constituencies include digital and social media, user conferences, advertising, direct email, free and evaluation software, industry events, media coverage, mobile application downloads, channel partners, and word-of-mouth and peer references.
 Customers
 Our customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries, including retail, consulting, technology, manufacturing, finance, banking, insurance, healthcare, education, and telecommunications, as well as the public sector.
Competition
 The analytics market is highly competitive and subject to rapidly-changing technology paradigms.  Within the analytics space, we compete with many different types of vendors, including large software vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, that provide one or more products that directly compete with our products.  We also compete with other analytics software providers, such as Qlik, Tableau Software, and the SAS Institute. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate our offerings and compete with these vendors and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes.  
 Our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control.  Some of these factors include product deployment options; analytical, mobility, data discovery, and visualization capabilities; performance and scalability; the quality and reliability of our customer service and support; licensing model; and brand recognition.  Failure to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our products, as well as materially adversely affect our revenue from both existing and prospective customers.
