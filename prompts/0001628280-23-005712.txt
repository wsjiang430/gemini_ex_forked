ITEM 1. Business.
General
We are one of the leading suppliers of replacement and upgrade parts in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, serving passenger cars, light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks, as well as specialty vehicles, including utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). As of December 31, 2022, we marketed approximately 129,000 distinct parts compared to approximately 118,000 as of December 25, 2021, many of which we designed and engineered. This number excludes private label stock keeping units and other variations in how we market, package and distribute our products, includes distinct parts of acquired companies and reflects distinct parts that have been discontinued at the end of their lifecycle. Our products are sold under our various brand names, under our customers’ private label brands or in bulk. We are one of the leading aftermarket suppliers of parts that were traditionally available to professional installers and consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or salvage yards. These parts include, among other parts, leaf springs, intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers, UTV windshields, and complex electronics modules. For fiscal 2022, approximately 75% of our products were sold under brands that we own, and the remainder of our products were sold for resale under customers' private labels, other brands or in bulk. We generate most of our net sales from customers in North America, primarily in the United States. Our products are sold primarily through aftermarket retailers, including through their on-line platforms; dealers; national, regional and local warehouse distributors and specialty markets; and salvage yards. We also distribute aftermarket parts outside the United States, with sales primarily into Canada and Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.
The Motor Vehicle Aftermarket Industry
The motor vehicle aftermarket that we operate in consists of the automotive aftermarket industry and the powersports aftermarket industry.
The automotive aftermarket industry has two distinct sectors: parts for passenger cars and light trucks, which according to the 2023 Auto Care Association Factbook, accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $356.5 billion in 2022, and parts for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $117.0 billion in 2022. We sell products into both sectors, with a majority of our products being designed for the passenger car and light truck sector.
Two distinct groups of end-users buy replacement vehicle parts for passenger cars and light trucks: (i) individual consumers, who purchase parts to perform "do-it-yourself" repairs on their own vehicles; and (ii) professional installers, which include vehicle repair shops and dealership service departments. Individual consumers typically are supplied through retailers and the retail arms of warehouse distributors. Vehicle repair shops generally purchase parts through local independent parts wholesalers and national parts distributors. Automobile dealership service departments generally obtain parts through the distribution systems of vehicle manufacturers and specialized national and regional parts distributors.
The largest purchasers of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle aftermarket parts are original equipment, or OE, manufacturers, independent distributors, including organizations associated with large buying groups and other distributors, as well as independent component specialists and rebuilders, and auto parts stores. The service work performed on medium- and heavy-duty vehicles is generally completed by end-user businesses that utilize these vehicles in their operations, fleets, and independent garages and distributors, who buy parts from the purchasers above or in some instances directly from suppliers like us.
Spending in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry generally can be grouped into three categories: discretionary, maintenance, and repair. Discretionary, such as accessories and performance, tends to move in line with consumer discretionary spending. Maintenance is composed of products and services, such as oil and oil changes, and tends to be less correlated with discretionary spending. Repair consists mainly of replacement parts that fail over time, and tends to be less cyclical as it is largely comprised of parts necessary for a vehicle to function properly or safely. The majority of our products fall into the repair category.
The increasing complexity and the number of different makes and models of automobiles have resulted in a significant increase in the number of products required to service the domestic and foreign automotive fleets. The requirement to include more products in inventory and the significant consolidation among distributors of automotive replacement parts have in turn resulted in larger distributors. See ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our Industry, Operations and Competition” for information regarding the potential impacts of consolidation on our business.
Retailers and others who purchase automotive aftermarket parts for resale often are constrained to a finite amount of space in which to display and stock products. Thus, the reputation for quality, customer service, and line profitability that a supplier provides typically are significant factors in a retailer’s or other reseller’s decision as to which product lines to carry in the limited space available. Further, because of the efficiencies achieved through the ability to order all or part of a complete line of products from one supplier (with possible volume discounts), as opposed to satisfying the same requirements through a variety of different sources, retailers and other resellers of automotive aftermarket parts often seek to purchase products from fewer but stronger suppliers.
The powersports aftermarket generally consists of parts for specialty vehicles such as UTVs and ATVs for both functional and upgrade accessories as well as replacement parts. Functional and upgrade accessories include parts such as engine performance upgrades, lighting and electronics, storage and cargo, tires and wheels, cabs, roofs and windshields, and other cosmetic parts. Replacement parts consist of brake systems, engine systems, electronics, frame and body parts, and driveline and transmission parts and are critical given the significant wear and tear often placed on those parts during normal use.
This industry consists of direct-to-consumer and direct-to-dealer channels through both retail and e-commerce platforms. Key purchasing decisions of customers in the powersports aftermarket industry include ease of ordering, ease of installation, the availability of products, delivery times, and overall product quality.

We group our products into four major classes: powertrain, chassis, motor vehicle body, and hardware. The following table represents each of the four classes as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years:
 | Percentage of Net Sales
 | Year Ended 
 | December 31, 2022 | | December 25, 2021 | | December 26, 2020
Powertrain | 37 | % | | 40 | % | 40 | %
Chassis | 41 | % | | 34 | % | 30 | %
Motor Vehicle Body | 18 | % | | 22 | % | 25 | %
Hardware | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Our powertrain product line includes intake and exhaust manifolds, cooling products, harmonic balancers, fluid lines, fluid reservoirs, connectors, 4-wheel drive components and axles, drain plugs, and other engine, transmission and axle components. Chassis products include control arms, ball joints, tie-rod ends, brake hardware and hydraulics, wheel and axle hardware, suspension arms, knuckles, links, bushings, leaf springs, and other suspension, steering, and brake components. Our line of motor vehicle body products includes door handles and hinges, window lift motors, window regulators, switches and handles, wiper components, lighting, electrical, and other interior and exterior vehicle body components, including windshields for UTVs. Hardware products include threaded bolts and auto body fasteners, automotive and home electrical wiring components, and other hardware assortments and merchandise.
We warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as designed on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on most of our products in the light- and medium-duty parts categories, with more limited warranties for our heavy-duty and specialty vehicle products. Our standard warranties limit the end-user’s remedy to the repair or replacement of the part that is defective. 
Product Development
Dorman is committed to product development and innovation with a customer-first approach keeping owners and installers in mind. Our engineers and designers focus on solutions designed to help save repair technicians time, save vehicle owners money, and provide sought-after vehicle enhancements and differentiation.
Dorman has dedicated teams devoted solely to ideation and innovation in support of its objective to develop new products, many of which are first to the aftermarket. Our teams of researchers, field analysts, and product specialists visit repair shop technicians and spend time with customers to listen to and understand their repair challenges and vehicle needs. 
We categorize our product development opportunities across three different spectrums: (1) alternative parts - direct aftermarket replacements for factory parts, (2) upgraded parts – parts with enhanced design, functionality or features based on identifying what made original parts problematic and developing new solutions that address the original failure modes, and (3) new parts - identifying parts that are not available from the OE or in the aftermarket that can enhance vehicle performance and user experience. Some of these 
opportunities are brand new to the aftermarket whereas others continue to expand our current portfolio offering. The following table represents the number of distinct parts we introduced for each of the last three fiscal years: 

 | Year Ended 
 | December 31, 2022 | December 25, 2021 | December 26, 2020
New to the aftermarket | 1,565 | 990 | 1,433 
Line extensions | 2,878 | 3,325 | 2,046 
Total distinct parts introduced | 4,443 | 4,315 | 3,479 

In 2022, we introduced several first-to-the-aftermarket repair solutions designed to fit a wide range of vehicles. New products included an upgraded OE FIX aluminum oil filter housing, hub rotor and caliper bracket bolt kits, additions to our roster of turbocharger components, and new complex electronic solutions, such as cruise control distance sensors, blind spot detection modules and other advanced driver assistance system, or ADAS, products. In 2022, we also released the first-to-aftermarket Tesla OE FIX door handle repair kit for Tesla S vehicles.
Our capabilities in advanced technology automotive components continued to grow in 2022 with the introduction of all-new construction climate control modules, electronic throttle bodies featuring Hall effect sensors and Sensor Shield™ shaft seals, and pre-programmed fuel pump driver modules. 
Our product development teams focus on repair solutions engineered to reduce the time technicians and vehicle owners typically spend on repairs requiring multiple related components. In 2022, that ongoing focus resulted in additions to our line of pre-assembled products, including loaded backing plates, drive shafts, and windshield wiper and transmission assemblies. We also provide new, cost-effective products designed to extend the life of cars and trucks. From core categories like window regulators, suspension components, and door lock actuators, to innovative body panel repair kits, we help ensure that aftermarket service providers and end-users have a range of money-saving repair options.
We expanded our growth in the heavy-duty sector with the acquisition of Dayton Parts in 2021 and in 2022 released several new heavy-duty products, including in-demand sensors and products for repairs above and below the chassis of Class 7 and Class 8 trucks.
We also expanded our motor vehicle solutions footprint in 2022 through the acquisition of Super ATV, LLC (“SuperATV”). SuperATV specializes in the design, manufacturing, and distribution of aftermarket parts and accessories for UTVs and ATVs. SuperATV is a leader in the powersports aftermarket because of its broad range of solutions, dedication to product development and innovation, and exceptional customer service. Through its retail presence and growing dealer network, SuperATV offers more than 11,000 products including windshields, axles, lift kits, tires, suspension components, and other accessories for popular ATV and UTV models from manufacturers such as Polaris®, Yamaha®, Honda®, Can-Am® and others.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products to purchasers, many of whom in turn supply individual consumers and professional installers. Our products are available in our customers’ retail stores, on our website and our customers’ websites, and through dealers and warehouse distributors.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a sales and sales support team of over 200 people selling our products either directly to our customers or, with respect to certain select customers, indirectly through independent manufacturers’ representative agencies worldwide.
Our sales efforts are not directed merely at selling individual products, but more broadly towards selling our entire product portfolio. Our sales strategy includes increasing sales not only by securing new customers, but also by adding new product lines and expanding product selection within existing customers in an effort to make our customers a destination for new-to-the-aftermarket products.
Among other things, we use digital advertising, social media, email, catalogs and brochures, to describe and promote our products. Our websites include www.DormanProducts.com, www.DaytonParts.com and 
www.SuperATV.com. These sites are not and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2022, we serviced more than 9,000 active accounts. During fiscal 2022, three customers each accounted for more than 10% of net sales and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 49% of net sales.
Manufacturing and Procurement
Most of our light- and medium-duty aftermarket automotive products are manufactured by third parties, while most of our heavy-duty products are manufactured in our facilities in the United States. The majority of our powersports aftermarket products are manufactured in our facilities in the United States and China. We engage third-party manufacturers around the world to develop and manufacture products according to our performance and design requirements, oftentimes using tooling that we own. In fiscal 2022, as a percentage of our total dollar volume of purchases, approximately 36% of our products were purchased from various suppliers throughout the United States and the balance of our purchases were directly from suppliers outside of the United States. Our global supplier network provides access to a broad array of manufacturing capabilities and technologies while limiting our dependency on any single source of supply. While our supplier selection and sourcing programs will continue to leverage our strategic manufacturers for a substantial portion of our product portfolio, we also continue to qualify alternative sources available to provide additional support and capacity, if needed. We make a concerted effort to build and nurture strong, healthy relationships with our suppliers. In fiscal 2022, we purchased automotive products in substantial volumes from over 250 suppliers, and no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of our total product purchases in fiscal 2022. For more information on risks relating to our supply chain, see ITEM 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our Industry, Operations and Competition."
Packaging, Inventory and Shipping
Finished products acquired from third-party suppliers are received at one or more of our company or third-party-operated facilities in the United States and Canada for sorting and distribution to our customers, depending on the type of part. It is our practice to inspect samples of shipments based on supplier performance. If cleared, these shipments of finished parts are logged into our computerized production tracking systems and staged for packaging, if necessary. 
We employ a variety of custom-designed packaging machines which include blister sealing, skin film sealing, clamshell sealing, bagging and boxing lines. Packaged product generally contains our label (or a private label), a part number, a universal packaging bar code suitable for electronic scanning, a description of the part and, if appropriate, installation instructions. Products are also sold in bulk to automotive parts manufacturers and packagers. Computerized tracking systems, mechanical counting devices and experienced workers combine to help ensure that the proper variety and numbers of parts meet the correct packaging materials at the appropriate places and times to produce the required quantities of finished products.
Packaged inventory is either stocked in the warehouse portions of our facilities or in distribution centers maintained by our third-party logistics providers and is organized to facilitate the most efficient methods of retrieving product to fill customer orders. We strive to maintain a level of inventory to adequately meet current customer order demand with additional inventory to satisfy new customer orders and special programs. 
We ship our products by contract carrier, common carrier or parcel service. Products are generally shipped to each customer's main warehouses for redistribution within its network or to dealers for further resale. In addition to utilizing our dealer networks, our specialty vehicle products that are ordered through the SuperATV website may be shipped directly to customers. In certain circumstances, at the request of a customer, we ship directly to that customer's warehouses, stores or other locations, either via smaller direct ship orders or consolidated store orders that are cross-docked.
Remanufacturing and Recycling Parts
Certain products we sell contain parts that can be recycled, or as more commonly referred to in our industry, remanufactured. We refer to the used product that is ultimately remanufactured as core. A used core is 
remanufactured and sold to the customer as a replacement for a unit on a vehicle. Customers and end-users that purchase a remanufactured replacement part will generally return the used core to us, which we then use in the remanufacturing process to make another finished good. Our core inventory consists of used cores purchased and held in our facilities, used cores that are in the process of being returned from our customers and end-users, and remanufactured cores held in finished goods inventory at our facilities. Our products that utilize cores include electronic control modules, hybrid batteries and complex mechatronics. We believe our remanufactured parts offer end-users an economical and safe way to maintain their cars on the road, while also reducing the impact on the environment.
Competition
The motor vehicle aftermarket industry is highly competitive. Competitive factors include price, product quality, breadth of product line, range of applications, customer service and the growth of e-commerce. Substantially all our products are subject to competition with similar products offered by other providers of aftermarket repair and replacement parts. Some of these competitors are divisions and subsidiaries of companies much larger than us who possess a longer history of operations and greater financial and other resources than we do. We also face competition from OE manufacturers who sell through their dealerships many of the same replacement parts that we sell, although these manufacturers generally sell parts only for vehicles they produce. Some of our current or former suppliers may compete with us by supplying directly to our customers. Further, some of our private label customers also compete with us. For more information on risks relating to our competition, see ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our Industry, Operations and Competition.”
Seasonality
Our business can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather generally results in an increase in parts failure at an accelerated rate, which generally leads to an increase in our sales for the duration of the extreme weather event. 
Impact of COVID-19
While COVID-19 did not adversely affect demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2022, during the year we did experience lingering pandemic-related pressures in the global supply network that caused logistical issues, including higher freight costs, supplier lead time delays of products and inflation with respect to materials and labor costs, which impacted our results. We will continue to closely monitor updates regarding COVID-19 and any impacts on our business and will adjust our operations according to guidelines from local, state and federal officials. In light of the foregoing, we may take actions that alter our business operations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a number of patents important to our business, and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our research and development investments in new products. As of December 31, 2022, we held 102 patents and 44 pending patent applications worldwide. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks in the United States and other countries. We also have licenses to intellectual property for the manufacture, use and sale of certain of our products.
We obtain patent and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Historically, we have done so organically, through commercial relationships, or in connection with acquisitions.
For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, see ITEM 1A, "Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our Intellectual Property and Information Security.”
Human Capital Resources
General
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,786 employees worldwide, substantially all of whom were employed full-time. Our employees are categorized by various functions. “Operations” consists of employees engaged in production, product distribution and inventory quality control. “Product Development” includes employees involved in product development and purchasing. “Quality and Engineering” consists of employees involved in internal and external quality management, manufacturing engineering, design, and testing. “Sales” includes employees employed in sales and customer service. “Administration” includes executive officers and individuals employed in finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other functions supporting our business. The following table shows employees by function and region.

 | December 31, 2022
 | U.S. | Non-U.S. | Total
Operations | 2,515 | 226 | 2,741
Product Development | 230 | 2 | 232 
Quality and Engineering | 189 | 60 | 249 
Sales | 293 | 24 | 317 
Administration | 238 | 9 | 247 
Total Employees | 3,465 | 321 | 3,786

None of our global employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be generally good.
Health and Safety
We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We have created and implemented processes to help eliminate safety events and reduce their frequency and severity. We also review and monitor our performance closely. We have adopted an environmental, health and safety policy outlining our commitment to policies and practices that support the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community, and the protection of the environment in the communities where we operate. We also maintain a human rights policy for the organization outlining our commitment to operating with respect for human rights.
Diversity and Inclusion
We embrace the diversity of our employees, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Employees are valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. Our Vice President of Development and Diversity is responsible for leading our diversity and inclusion strategy. Among other things, we demonstrate our commitment to diversity and inclusion through our annual “All In” initiative, a summit focused on inviting our employees to think and engage more with ideas such as diversity and inclusion to foster a collaborative environment.
We also embrace diversity on our Board of Directors, where 33% of our independent directors are female and 17% of our independent directors are ethnically diverse.
As part of our commitment to a culture of inclusion, our Contributor Resource Group, or CRG, Program broadens and enhances company-wide interaction opportunities for our employees. Our CRG Program is open to all and involves activities for employees whose background is the focus of each CRG and those who are supportive of the groups that have been formed. These company-wide networks build on and coordinate with local teams that are already active in our operations and include groups such as those focused on women, veterans, individuals desiring to learn more about diverse cultural backgrounds and employees who seek to learn more about career growth and leadership opportunities.
Talent and Development
Our talent strategy is focused on attracting the best talent, developing their skill sets and experiences and rewarding their performance. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our leadership team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Leadership also participates in a robust bi-annual talent review and succession planning process. In addition, leadership reviews employee engagement surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues.
Compensation
We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry and in the geographies in which we compete for talent. We conduct an executive compensation benchmarking review annually to help ensure we are providing market-based compensation including base salary, and short-term and long-term incentives. We also participate in annual compensation surveys for all positions and strive to compensate our top talent and key roles competitively. Moreover, we believe our long-term incentives are structured in a manner to provide time-based vesting schedules that are retentive. 
For information on risks relating to our human capital resources, see ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – Losing the services of our executive officers or other highly qualified and experienced employees, or failing to attract and retain any of such officers or employees, could adversely affect our business.”
