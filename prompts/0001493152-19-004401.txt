ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Our Corporate History
 
We are a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nevada. The original business started in 1993 as Ferris Productions, Inc. In September 2001, Ferris Productions, Inc. merged with GameCom, Inc. to ultimately become VirTra Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation.
 
Effective as of October 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), we completed a conversion from a Texas corporation to a Nevada corporation pursuant to a Redomestication Plan of Conversion (the “Plan of Conversion”) that was approved by our Board of Directors on June 23, 2016 and our stockholders on September 16, 2016. On the Effective Date, 7,927,774 shares of common stock of VirTra Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation, were converted into 7,927,774 shares of common stock of VirTra, Inc., a Nevada corporation. No stockholders exercised appraisal rights or dissenters’ rights for such shares in accordance with the Texas Business Organization Code.
 
As part of the Plan of Conversion, we filed Articles of Incorporation in Nevada whereby we changed our name from VirTra Systems, Inc. to VirTra, Inc. and revised our capitalization. Our Articles of Incorporation filed in Nevada authorize us to issue 62,500,000 shares, of which (1) 60,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of which (a) 50,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.0001, (b) 2,500,000 shares shall be Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and (c) 7,500,000 shares shall be Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”) and (2) 2,500,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which may, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors be issued in one or more series (the “Preferred Stock”). We also adopted new bylaws as part of the Plan of Conversion.
 
Effective March 2, 2018 we effected a 1 for 2 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock (together the “Reverse Stock Split”). All references to shares of our Common Stock in this report on Form 10-K refer to the number of shares of Common Stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split and are presented as if the Reverse Stock Split had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Pursuant to an Offering Circular on Form 1-A, as amended, pursuant to Regulation A, we offered on a “best efforts” basis a minimum of 714,286 shares of common stock and a maximum of 1,428,571 shares of common stock (the “Offered Shares”), par value of $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a price per share of Common Stock of $7.00. The minimum offering amount (“Minimum Offering Amount”) was $5,000,000 and the maximum offering amount (“Maximum Offering Amount”) was $10,000,000. We terminated the offering on March 29, 2018. No shares were sold pursuant to the offering.
 
On March 29, 2018, our shares of Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol, “VTSI.”
 
Business Overview
 
We develop, sell and support use of force training and marksmanship firearms training systems and accessories for law enforcement, military, educational or civilian use. Our simulators use software, hardware and content to create uniquely effective and realistic training that does not require live ammunition or less-than-lethal munitions, which can both save money and provide certain training capabilities unavailable to live fire exercises. We have developed a higher standard in simulation training including capabilities such as: multi-screen, video-based scenarios, unique scenario authoring ability, superior training scenarios, the patented Threat-Fire™ shoot-back system, powerful gas-powered simulated recoil weapons, and more.
 
The VirTra simulator allows marksmanship and realistic scenario-based training to take place on a daily basis without the need for a shooting range, protective equipment, role players, safety officers, or a scenario-based training site. The simulator also allows students to receive immediate feedback from the instructor without the potential for sustaining injuries by the instructor or the students. The instructor is able to teach and re-mediate critical issues, while placing realistic stress on the students due to the realism and safe training environment created by the VirTra simulator.
 
We also are engaged in licensing our technology to That’s Eatertainment Corp. (“TEC”), formerly known as Modern Round Entertainment Corporation (“MREC”), a developer and operator of a combined dining and entertainment concept centered on an indoor shooting experience.
 
Business Strategy
 
We have four main customer groups, namely, law enforcement, military, educational (includes colleges and police academies) and civilian. These are very different markets and require different sales and marketing programs as well as personnel. Our focus is to expand the market share and scope of our training simulators sales to these identified customer groups by pursuing the following key growth strategies:

● | Build Our Core Business. Our goal is to profitably grow our market share by continuing to develop, produce and market the most effective simulators possible. Through disciplined growth in our business, we have achieved a solid balance sheet by increasing our working capital and limiting our bank debt. We plan to add staff to our experienced management team as needed to meet the expected increase in demand for our products and services as we increase our marketing and sales activities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase Total Addressable Market. We plan to increase the size of our total addressable market. This effort will focus on new marketing and new product and/or service offerings for the purpose of widening the number of types of customers who might consider our products or services uniquely compelling. 
● | Broaden Product Offerings. Since formation in 1993, our company has had a proud tradition of innovation in the field of simulation and virtual reality. We plan to release revolutionary new products and services as well as continue incremental improvements to existing product lines. In some cases, the company may enter a new market segment via the introduction of a new type of product or service.

● | Partners and Acquisitions. We try to spend our time and funds wisely and not tackle tasks that can be done more efficiently with partners. For example, international distribution is often best accomplished through a local distributor or agent. We are also open to the potential of acquiring additional businesses or of being acquired ourselves, based on what is expected to be optimal for our long-term future and our stockholders.

Modern Round, a Related Party
 
On the civilian side, we have a Co-venture agreement with Modern Round, Inc. (formerly, Modern Round, LLC) (“Modern Round”), a wholly owned subsidiary of That’s Eatertainment Corp. (“TEC”), formerly known as Modern Round Entertainment Corporation (“MREC”), a developer and operator of a combined dining and entertainment concept centered on an indoor virtual shooting entertainment concept. TEC is rolling out its entertainment concept nationally and currently operates one virtual shooting lounge facility in Peoria, Arizona and is currently operates Modern Round shooting lounges in four Lucky Strike Entertainment, LLC locations. Additionally, Modern Round is working on developing a multiple concept in Mesa, Arizona. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Modern Round, a related party, an exclusive, non-transferable royalty-bearing right and license to use our software in virtual shooting lounge facilities for sales-based royalties.
Operations and Suppliers
 
We produce some of our own products. We also rely on a variety of suppliers. Management does not expect to encounter future delays with suppliers that would have a material impact on us. However, supplier delays would adversely affect us.
Competition and Competitive Landscape
 
We compete against a number of established companies that provide similar products and services, some of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. There are also companies whose products do not compete directly, but are sometimes closely related to the products we offer. Arotech, Inc., Cubic, Inc., Laser Shot, Inc., Meggitt Training Systems, and Ti Training Corp are our main competitors in some or all of our markets.
 
We believe that our products and services are superior to those offered by our competitors based on our strength in developing higher quality software solutions, our patented accessories and our extensive library of virtual shooting scenario content that would require a substantial investment by a competitor to offer a comparable product.

Modern Round Co-Venture Agreement with a Related Party
 
On January 16, 2015, the Company entered into a Co-Venture Agreement (the “Co-Venture Agreement”) with Modern Round, LLC (“MR”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TEC, formerly MREC, a related party. The Co-Venture Agreement grants TEC an exclusive non-transferrable license to use the Company’s technology and certain equipment solely for use at locations to operate the concept, as defined in the Co-Venture Agreement. Throughout the duration of the Co-Venture Agreement, TEC will pay the Company a royalty based on gross revenue, as defined and subject to certain minimum royalties commencing with the first twelve-month period subsequent to the respective milestone date of June 1, 2017. Under the terms of the original agreement, if the total royalty payments for locations in the United States and Canada together do not total at least the minimum royalty amount specified in the agreement, TEC may pay to VirTra the difference between the amount of total royalty payments and the minimum specified in the agreement to maintain exclusivity.
 
On August 16, 2017, the Company entered into the first amendment to the Co-Venture Agreement to permit TEC to sublicense the VirTra Technology to third party operators of stand-alone location-based entertainment companies. TEC agreed to pay the Company royalties for any such sublicenses in an amount equal to 10% of the revenue paid to TEC in cases where TEC pays for the cost of the equipment for such location or 14% of the revenue paid to TEC in cases where it does not pay for the cost of the equipment.
 
In April 2018, Modern Round effected a 1 for 12,000 reverse stock split, followed by a 1 for 2,000 forward stock split completed in November 2018. As a result, the Company holds as of December 31, 2018, 560,000 shares of TEC common stock representing approximately 5.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of TEC. The Company determined a bona fide offer by TEC to sell investments for an amount less than the carrying amount of the Company’s investment occurred for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and an impairment loss of $254,933 and $613,241 was taken to write-down the TEC investment to the estimated fair value. The Company recognized the impairment loss on its investment in TEC as operating expense. The Company recorded its investment at the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of $1,120,000 and $1,374,933.
 
On July 23, 2018, the Company entered into the second amendment to the Co-Venture Agreement with TEC to (i) confirm the minimum royalty deficiency benefit due for the royalty period ended May 31, 2018; (ii) establish payment terms for the minimum royalty deficiency benefit due, to include both cash and promissory note payment; (iii) clarify the exclusivity provisions of the Agreement; and (iv) amend the minimum royalty calculations to only TEC branded facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Company recognized license fee income (royalties) from TEC of $549,568 and $289,947.
 
In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Company holds a warrant to purchase 25,577 shares of TEC common stock, adjusted for the 1 for 12,000 reverse stock split and the 1 for 2,000 forward stock split, at an exercise price of $2.4436 per share. This warrant became exercisable on the date of grant and expires on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, if not earlier pursuant to the terms of the option.

We own the trademark for “VirTra,” “VirTra Systems”, “Threat-Fire” and many other branding trademarks. These trademarks are registered in the United States. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
 
We also have copyright protection for our intellectual property produced for use in our products.
 
We rely on the laws of unfair competition and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other security measures. However, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Effective trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the United States. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively.

Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our research and product development expenses were approximately $1,358,000 and $1,285,000, respectively.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials/Manufacturing and Assembly
 
We obtain the key components of our products from a variety of sources that we purchase on a purchase order basis from local suppliers at market prices based on our production requirements. We believe alternative sources generally exist for the components used in our products.
 
Our manufacturing, assembly, warehouse and shipping facilities are located in Tempe Arizona. See Business – Property.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 79 full-time employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we do not currently have any labor disputes.
Property
 
We lease approximately 37,729 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space from an unaffiliated third party for our corporate office, manufacturing, assembly, warehouse and shipping facility located at 7970 South Kyrene Road, Tempe, Arizona 85284. In addition, we lease approximately 4,529 rentable square feet of office and industrial space from an unaffiliated third party for our machine shop at 2169 East 5th St., Tempe, Arizona 85284. The machine shop lease expires in March 2019. In April, 2019 the Company will relocate the machine shop from the Fifth St. location to 7910 South Kyrene Road, within the same business complex as our main office. The Company executed a lease amendment to add an additional 5,131 rentable square feet for the machine shop and extended its existing lease, this lease expires in April 2024.
Operations
 
Our operations are conducted from our principal executive office in Tempe, Arizona. We have no offices or employees internationally. However, our U.S.-based sales force works to secure contracts to supply our products in U.S. and foreign markets. As of December 31, 2018, we have performed sales contracts and warranty service obligations in the U.S. and 29 foreign countries. When our products are introduced into an international market, it is either pursuant to a contract directly with a customer located in the foreign country, or pursuant to a contract between our company and a U.S. government agency (such as the Department of State—). In the latter instance, our customer is the relevant U.S. government agency. The government agency may then distribute our products to third parties within the particular country.

Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including, but not limited to, branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets.
 
We are also subject to export laws and regulations. These laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”), administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Among its many provisions, the ITAR requires a license application for the export of firearms and congressional approval for any application with a total value of $1 million or higher.
 
Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
 
For additional information related to export regulations, see Item 1A, entitled “Risk Factors – We may not be able to receive or retain the necessary licenses or authorizations required for us to export or re-export….”
 
Government Contracts
 
The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. For additional information related to government contracts, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government Contracts.”
Environmental
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
