ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
 
KULR Technology Group, Inc., through our wholly-owned subsidiary KULR Technology Corporation, develops and commercializes high-performance thermal management technologies for electronics, batteries, and other components across an array of applications. Currently, we are focused on targeting the following applications: electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems (collectively referred to herein as “E-Mobility”); artificial intelligence and Cloud computing; energy storage; and 5G communication technologies. Our proprietary, core technology is a carbon fiber material, with roots in aerospace and defense, that provides what we believe to be superior thermal conductivity and heat dissipation in an ultra-lightweight and pliable material. By leveraging our proprietary cooling solutions that have been developed through longstanding partnerships with NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab and others, our products and services make E-Mobility products and other products safer and more stable.
 
Our management believes that the E-Mobility industry has created and will create significant new opportunities for the application of our technology and know-how. We believe these new opportunities will be further driven by certain changing preferences that we’ve observed in younger generations that must increasingly cope with higher population density, global warming, and the rapidly evolving communications and computing needs of their personal devices and the surrounding infrastructure. As a result, we predict that the younger generations will increasingly prefer to attend meetings by video conference; rent a car, bike, or scooter, or call an app-based car service instead of owning a vehicle; and leverage the Cloud to perform tasks traditionally done in person, such as shopping for lunch, clothes, electronics and other consumer goods that also leverages an expanding E-Mobility delivery network.
 
In addition to evolving demands led by consumer-preferences, we have observed trending manufacturer-led opportunities in industries that have become increasingly more reliant on the Cloud, on portability and on high-demand processing power. For example, car manufacturers are increasingly providing options that take over the responsibility for driving, diagnosing its own service requirements and analyzing on-board systems data and efficiency. The communications and entertainment industries are leveraging increasingly more powerful and portable devices to deliver live and high-definition content and experiences. These innovations will require high bandwidth communication devices that can handle the power drain and computational requirements to keep up with the sophisticated security and software tools that will power these advanced product offerings. As a result of these manufacturer and consumer trends, we believe that the new generations of high-powered, small form-factor semiconductors are out-pacing the development in lithium ion batteries. 
 
The above-described advances in micro technology, portable power, and compact energy efficient devices linked to an ever-widening Internet of Things (“IoT”) via the Cloud are driving opportunities that forms the focus of the Company’s business development plan. We believe that our core technology and historical development focus on improving lithium-ion battery performance and safety, positions us in a competitively advantageous position to enhance key components to the evolving mobile applications for a wide range of consumer products and IoT. We have found that as chip performance increases, power consumption increases, and more heat is generated as a byproduct. When chip size reduces, there is an increased potential for a hot spot on the chip, which can degrade system performance, or even cause spontaneous combustion. However, electronic system components must operate within a specific temperature range on both the high and low end to operate properly. After strenuous testing, we believe we have developed heat management solutions that significantly improve upon traditional heat storage and dissipation solutions and that improve upon their rigidity and durability. We also believe that the traditional solutions are not equipped to handle the evolving marketplace. However, through a combination of custom design services and provision of proprietary hardware solutions, our products reduce manufacturing complexity and provide a lighter weight solution than traditional thermal management materials and we believe our products can meet the heat management demands of components and batteries being designed into the newest mobile technologies and applications.


Our management’s growth strategy has put particular focus on targeting E-Mobility applications for its core technology. We believe we are well-positioned to provide a broad range of E-mobility solutions, and intend to expand our business through internal growth and acquisition. In the case of acquisitions, we seek to acquire businesses in related markets that are synergistic to our existing operations, technologies, and management experience. This focus will highlight markets in which we can: (1) integrate our existing technology into the acquiree’s product offerings or simultaneously offer our products and services through the acquiree’s customer base and channels; (2) gain a leading market position and provide vertically integrated services where we can secure economies of scale, premium market positioning, and operational synergies; and/or (3) establish a leading position in selected markets and channels of the acquiree through a joint broad-based, hi-tech, E-Mobility branding campaign. We have developed an acquisition discipline based on a set of financial, market and management criteria to evaluate opportunities. If we were to successfully close an acquisition, we would seek to integrate it while minimizing disruption to our existing operations and those of the acquired business, while exploiting the technical and managerial synergies from integration.

Corporate History
 
KUTG was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2015 and was formerly known as “KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc.” and, prior to that, as “Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation.” In April 2016, KUTG implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, KULR Technology Corp, was formed in 2013 and is based in Santa Clara, California. Since its inception, KTC primarily focused on developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies, which it acquired through assignment from and license with KTC’s co-founder Dr. Timothy Knowles. Prior to 2013, KTC’s technologies were used in numerous advanced space and industrial applications for National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), Boeing, and Raytheon. A few notable achievements were the use of KTC’s technologies in the X-31 aircraft (battery heat sink), Mercury Messenger (battery heat sink), and X-51 Scramjet (heat exchanger).
 
On June 19, 2017, KUTG closed a share exchange with KTC and 100% of the shareholders of KTC (the “KTC Shareholders”) whereby the KTC Shareholders agreed to transfer an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of KTC’s common stock to KUTG in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of KUTG’s common stock to the KTC Shareholders (the “Share Exchange”), resulting in KTC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of KUTG and KTC’s business of developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies becoming KUTG’s main operation.
 
The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, with KTC being treated as the acquiring company for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements included in this Annual Report reflect the assets, liabilities and historical results of KTC prior to the completion of the Share Exchange.
 
On August 30, 2018, KUTG changed its name from “KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc.” to “KULR Technology Group, Inc.” by filing a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
 
On December 4, 2018, KUTG filed a definitive Information Statement on Form 14C (the “December Information Statement”), giving notice to KUTG’s shareholders that on November 5, 2018, KUTG executed a written consent in lieu of shareholder meeting authorizing KUTG to: (i) amend KUTG’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares of common stock to 500,000,000 shares of common stock; (ii) adopt and ratify the KULR Technology Group 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and (iii) ratify the authorization of the issuance of 1,000,000 shares (the “Voting Preferred Shares”) of Series A Voting Preferred Stock to Michael Mo, KUTG’s Chief Executive Officer. On December 28, 2018, twenty (20) days after the mailing date of the December Information Statement, KUTG was deemed authorized by ratifying vote of its majority shareholders and the authorization granted by its Board of Directors to issue the Voting Preferred Shares, which KUTG has not but expects to do in the near future. On December 31, 2018, KUTG filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000. As a result, the aggregate number of the Company’s authorized capital stock became 520,000,000 shares.
 
Market Opportunity and Strategy
 
Market
 
The world of electronics continues to become more and more demanding and performance driven. The increasing demand for reliability of microelectronics and lithium-ion batteries has pushed thermal management to the forefront of many industries. We target our solutions to serve four application markets: electric transportation, mobile computing, cloud computing, and space exploration and communications.
 
According to Market Research Future, the global thermal management market is expected to reach approximately $15 billion by end of 2023 with 7% compound annual growth rate during the forecast period from 2017 to 2023. According to the report, in recent years, electronic devices and systems have undergone tremendous technological growth. Advancements in the electronics industry have led to an increased need for innovative thermal management technologies, which serve to improve performance and reliability. The report states that technological progress has come on two fronts: increased functionality on a single device unit and miniaturization of each unit. As a result, there has been an increased demand for thermal management technologies. The report analyzes the thermal market by four segments, including hardware, software, interfaces, and substrates.
 
Electrical Transportation Market. According to Frost & Sullivan’s recently released “Global Electric Vehicle Market Outlook 2018,” global EV sales will climb from 1.2 million units in 2017 to approximately 2 million units in 2019. The EV industry will need to overcome major challenges related to battery technology and charging infrastructure, both of which have fallen far short of the pace set by global EV sales. The charging infrastructure market, which includes batteries and battery technology, according to an AT Kearney report, will be a $29 billion global market by 2020 within the overall $390 billion global E-Mobility market.

Mobile Computing Market. The next generation mobile computing platform, also known as the “5G” mobile wireless standard, presents new challenges and demands to improve the performance and reliability of mobile infrastructures and consumer devices. According to the IHS Markit’s global study, in 2035, when 5G’s full economic benefit should be realized across the globe, a broad range of industries – from retail to education, transportation to entertainment, and everything in between – could produce up to $12.3 trillion worth of goods and services enabled by 5G.
Cloud Computing Market. Market analysts at Forrester Research project the cloud computing market to be $178 billion in 2018, up from $146 billion in 2017 with sustained growth at 22% annually. Forrester also predicts that more than 50% of global enterprises will rely on at least one public cloud platform. A key area of cloud computing is optical data transfer and communications connections and lines. Optical data is faster and more efficient and, as cloud computing banks move to acquire and utilize optical data, thermal management will play a pivotal role in maintaining the peak performance and safety of these expensive and highly sensitive computer connections. The processing demands of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology in the cloud requires advanced thermal management solutions for processors and memory modules.
 
Space Exploration and Communications Market. According to BIS Research, the Space Industry, is valued at $360 billion in 2018, is projected grow at a CAGR of 5.6%, to value $558 billion by 2026. Demand for nano-satellites and re-usable launch vehicle systems is anticipated to be driven by the massive investment made by governments and private enterprises. The overall trend in space investment is stable financially but explosive numerically, providing vastly more opportunity for space technology providers. Increasingly, investments in space exploration and commercialization are being led by well-funded private companies with most focused-on satellite development and deployment. KULR’s heritage in space thermal management technology positions us well in this market.
 
We believe KULR’s technology solution excels in a number of categories important in the world of thermal management. KULR’s proprietary carbon fiber-based solutions are generally more thermally conductive, lighter weight, require less contact pressure, and offer greater design flexibility and durability compared to traditional solutions. As a result, we believe KULR has real potential to offer a unique value proposition to customers in the multibillion-dollar thermal management industry. KULR aims to provide cost-effective, superior thermal management solutions for a group of electronic manufacturers.

Sales Strategy
 
The Company plans to market and sell KULR thermal management products (“component products”) and finished end-products (“OEM products”) that the Company develops with its partners into its sales and distribution channels. For the component products, the Company will market directly to its customers and utilize distributor partners and agents in Japan, China and EU countries. For its OEM products, the Company will sell into distributor channels primarily as a B2B business.
Advertising and Communications Strategy
 
We plan to utilize all forms of advertising and communications tools at our disposal. This includes commissioning unbiased white papers and technical papers, attending, sponsoring, and guest speaking at industry events, conferences, and symposiums. We have hired a public relations consultant who will oversee our press releases and media relations interface with newspapers, magazines, and blogs. We have also hired a SEO specialist for social media outreach activities and will also rely on the company’s pedigree within the thermal management community to spread high praise via word of mouth. To date, as a result of these efforts, we have been mentioned in Wall Street Journal (“WSJ”), Cheddar TV, CNBC, Forbes, EE Times, USA Today, Business Insider and others.
Acquisition Strategy
 
We believe we are well-positioned to provide a broad range of E-mobility solutions, and intend to expand our business through internal growth and acquisition. In the case of acquisitions, we seek to acquire businesses in related markets that are synergistic to our existing operations, technologies, and management experience. This focus will highlight markets in which we can: (1) integrate our existing technology into the acquiree’s product offerings or simultaneously offer our products and services through the acquiree’s customer base and channels; (2) gain a leading market position and provide vertically integrated services where we can secure economies of scale, premium market positioning, and operational synergies; and/or (3) establish a leading position in selected markets and channels of the acquiree through a joint broad-based, hi-tech, E-Mobility branding campaign. We have developed an acquisition discipline based on a set of financial, market and management criteria to evaluate opportunities. If we were to successfully close an acquisition, we would seek to integrate it while minimizing disruption to our existing operations and those of the acquired business, while exploiting the technical and managerial synergies from integration.
Intellectual Property and Patent Strategy
 
Our intellectual property strategy includes pursuing patent protection for new innovations in core carbon fiber architecture development, application development, acquisition of intellectual property, and licensing of third-party patents and intellectual property. As of March 29, 2019, we have seven pending nonprovisional and provisional patent applications and we have four patents granted and assigned to KULR. We also have an exclusive license to four third party patents. 
Product and Services
 
Our heat management products and services can be divided into the following categories, subcategories and functionalities:
 
Lithium Ion (“L-ion”) Battery Thermal Runaway Shield (“TRS”): KULR has developed a vaporizing heatsink aimed at passive resistance to thermal runaway propagation in L-ion batteries in partnership with National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center (“NASA JSC”). The heatsink shield designed for NASA JSC is a novel configuration, thin and lightweight, for use in conjunction with 18650 cells. The heatsink shield has proven to keep neighboring cells safe from thermal runaway propagation after a trigger cell was intentionally overheated. This lightweight solution can be used in energy storage and industrial and consumer electronics applications that require a lightweight and passive solution for battery safety.
Fiber Thermal Interface Material (“FTI”): KULR thermal interface materials (“TIMs”) consist of vertically oriented carbon fiber velvets attached to a film of polymer or metal. The fiber packing density and orientation are selected to serve a wide range of applications, including hostile thermal and chemical environments, sliding interfaces, and interfaces with widely varying gaps. They can be coated for electrical isolation. They require low contact pressure and provide high thermal conductivity. Their light weight and high compliance make them uniquely suited for aerospace, industrial and high-performance commercial devices.
Phase Change Material (“PCM”) Heat Sink: KULR PCM composite heat sinks consisting of a conductive carbon fiber velvet embedded with a suitable alkane (“paraffin”) having high latent heat at its melting point. Such heat sinks offer passive thermal control for instruments that would otherwise overheat or under-cool during periodic operations. A typical application involves lasers that dissipate heat but need tight thermal control where active cooling is unavailable.

Internal Short Circuit (“ISC”) Device: In March 2018, KULR reached an agreement with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”), a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, to be the exclusive manufacturing and distribution partner for the patented ISC device, which causes predictable battery cell failures in L-ion batteries, making them easier to study and, therefore, safer. L-ion batteries are the industry and consumer standard for portable power; billions of individual battery cells exist and billions more are planned for production. They provide power for everything from smart phones and laptops to electric cars and space crafts. But L-ion batteries fail, sometimes with catastrophic results. Due to the relative rarity of cell failures, scientists and researchers had been unable to reliably or accurately replicate latent defect cell failures in lab settings, impeding research into safer battery technology. In 2015, researchers at NREL and NASA developed and patented a device – the ISC – that creates these cell failures in predictable conditions. KULR will market both ISC devices to battery cell manufacturers and ISC embedded battery cells to OEM manufacturers.
Competition
 
Currently, the battery industry uses a number of solutions to mitigate thermal runaway propagation which solutions are offered by Unifrax, Lydall, Outlast, 3M, Engineered Syntactic Systems, Celono, AllCell and others. Each of their solutions offer unique features and benefits for a specific application. We do not believe, however, that there is a one size fits all solution across all applications. We believe our TRS solution offers competitive light-weight and effective solutions for high energy battery cells because it is more flexible and can fit into different design configurations. For applications that require passive, light-weight solutions for high energy density battery cells, TRS offers a competitive solution.
 
Thermal interface material is a large and fragmented market with many large suppliers including: Henkel Bergquist, Fujipoly, Laird, 3M, Honeywell and others. These solutions are typically based on silicone and thermal particles. KULR’s FTI offers high bulk thermal conductivity and low contact pressure requirements, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other thermal interface solutions.
 
Our licensed ISC device offers a reliable way to trigger battery cell thermal runaway compared to nail penetration, over-charging or over-heating the cell. ISC does not rely on mechanically damaging the battery exterior to activate the short, as do most of the other evaluation methodologies. Instead, the ISC devices trigger true internal shorts. This makes it possible to accurately pinpoint and fix problems leading to malfunctions, an ability that we believe will give us a competitive advantage over other testing solutions.
 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Compliance
 
Certain substances we use in our manufacturing process are subject to federal governmental regulations (such as Environmental Protect Agency regulations). We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable governmental regulations, and that the cost and effect of compliance with environmental laws is not material. As a small generator of hazardous substances, we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances, such as acetone that is used in very small quantities to manufacture our products. We are currently in compliance with these regulations. Most new materials sold in the U.S or in many other countries require regulation by government authorities. In most other countries, there are no specific regulations that require additional regulation, but some countries do have registration requirements with which we comply to the best our ability.
Employees
 
As of March 29, 2019, we had 12 employees and 5 consultants. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
Intellectual Property
 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets. We have, and will continue to, file applications for and/or obtain patents, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by implementing organizational nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. As of March 29, 2019, we held 4 U.S. patents and 7 non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2035. In addition, KULR has exclusive license on 4 patents from its partnerships. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine KUTG products; KULR has been granted trademarks for Class 9 and Class 17 applications.
