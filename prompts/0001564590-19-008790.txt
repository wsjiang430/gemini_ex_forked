ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 One Stop Systems (OSS) designs, manufactures and markets specialized high-performance computing modules and systems.  These specialized computers incorporate state-of-the art components and allow our customers to offer high-end computing capabilities (often embedding within their equipment) to their target markets. Our customer applications often require ultra-fast processing power and the ability to quickly access and store ever-growing data sets. We are uniquely positioned as a specialized provider for the high-end of this marketplace providing custom servers, compute accelerators, solid-state storage arrays and system expansion systems. We deliver this high-end technology to our customers through the sale of equipment and embedded software.
 The worldwide high-performance computing (HPC) market is expected to grow from $38.4 billion in 2018 to $43.9 billion by 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.0%. We are establishing a leading position as a provider of specialized servers, compute accelerators and flash storage arrays to the high-end of this growing marketplace. In addition, we are a leading provider of PCIe over cable adapters and expansion systems used worldwide. PCIe is the high performance communication protocol used within servers for Input/Output expansion.  This protocol can also be used between servers and external systems to enable additional expansion at very high performance levels.   OSS systems offer high performance in a physically dense packaging, enabling our customers to build end-user systems that occupy less space and require less power and cooling than conventional systems. 
 The more GPU compute acceleration and flash-based storage resources available to a server, the faster it can process, store, and retrieve data. In cases where the amount of these resources does not fit within the constraints of a conventional server, PCIe is used to disaggregate the resources into a multi-chassis solution. We have built leading edge expertise in PCIe expansion technology and leveraged it to design and build systems that offer a high quantity and density of GPU compute acceleration, flash storage and other I/O resources. 
 A key element of our product strategy is technological market leadership. We believe a first-to-market strategy is key to our ability to continue to win significant OEM design wins. As a result, we are continually developing new state-of-the-art products. Our ability to drive the leading edge of technology is enabled by our strong relationships with strategic component manufactures, including NVIDIA (for GPUs), Western Digital (for flash memory) and Broadcom (for PCIe switch components). In each of these cases, OSS has access to product roadmaps and other technical information relating to future technology. Access to this information allows us to begin our design process well before the future components we are designing for even exist. This accelerates our time-to-market and allows us to produce and release state-of-the-art designs well ahead of our competitors. 
 High-performance computing applications are moving beyond the traditional academic and scientific realms to broad application across the spectrum of vertical markets. These applications include computationally intense areas like artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, seismic exploration, media and entertainment, test and measurement, medical imaging, genomics, cyber security and defense. We are well positioned to leverage these market trends and capitalize on our unique core competencies in high speed system design. We have a proven track record of delivering first-to-market advanced technologies and have continued to do so recently with high-end GPU accelerators and high-performance flash arrays with light-weight removable high-capacity canisters. These products fit solidly into the emerging markets for specialized high-performance computing. 
 OSS sells its products worldwide to industry leading customers.  In total, we service over 1,500 customers per year, with major repeat customers including disguise, National Instruments, and Raytheon. We anticipate continued market growth in our target markets and sustaining the ability to increase market share through our leading technology, engineering expertise, supply chain management and go-to-market innovation. 
 We were originally organized as One Stop Systems, LLC, a California limited liability company in 1998 before converting into One Stop Systems, Inc., a California corporation in 1999. On July 6, 2016, we entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Mission Technology Group, Inc. (“Magma”) whereby Magma merged with and into OSS with OSS continuing as the surviving corporation. We reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 14, 2017 and began trading as a public company on the Nasdaq Capital Markets on February 1, 2018. On August 31, 2018, we acquired Concept Development Inc., a provider of specialty in-flight entertainment located in Irvine, California.  On October 31, 2018, we acquired Bressner Technology GmbH located near Munich, Germany.  Bressner is a valued-added reseller of high technology hardware.  Our principal executive offices are located at 2235 Enterprise Street, Suite 110, Escondido, California 92029 and our telephone number is (760) 745-9883.

 These industry sectors expect to deploy increasingly faster computing systems to meet industry and competitive goals. GPU computer acceleration and high-density flash storage are key subsets of the high-performance computing market. 
 GPU Compute Acceleration 
 The capabilities and speed of GPU accelerated computers are beginning to drive significant advances in AI and machine learning. Massive amounts of data are being collected, stored and analyzed by today’s sophisticated algorithms.   AI and machine learning are poised to transform worldwide business, as advances in computing speed and storage come together to enable businesses to solve complex problems. 
High Density Solid-State Storage 
 The market for flash memory based solid-state storage systems is large and growing. According to a study by MarketsandMarkets, the flash storage market is growing at 9.5% per year and is expected to reach $25.3 billion by 2022. The proliferation of larger and larger databases, virtualized servers, virtual desktop servers, analytic application servers and other server configurations are feeding the need for higher capacity and higher performance storage. 
 Traditionally, companies have used hard disk drives for their primary storage.  Hard drive based systems are being replaced by flash memory based systems which offer higher capacity, performance and ruggedness.  Flash-based storage systems also consume significantly less power. 
 Flash-based storage systems are especially useful for many high performance computing applications, which deal with large amounts of data and the need for complex calculations to be completed very rapidly. In these applications, speed and efficiency are paramount. Military systems, for example, generate vast amounts of data using sensor systems, radar systems, and a myriad of other applications. This data needs to be collected, stored, analyzed and acted upon in a real-time environment. 
 Key Components of Our Business 
 Product Development 
 Our systems are built using the latest GPU and flash storage technologies and draw upon years of expertise in designing and manufacturing semi-custom systems for OEMs. We have a history of being first to market with many solutions for emerging technologies. When PCIe was introduced in 2005, we were the first company to produce PCIe over cable adapters allowing system-to-system communication at same speed as internal I/O expansion. Today, we are one of the largest providers of PCIe adapters and expansion components used worldwide. 
 When GPU technology and solid-state flash were first introduced, we began designing systems that maximized the effectiveness of these technologies. We now produce compute systems with large numbers of GPUs and flash memory to allow faster processing and data storage and retrieval. The more GPUs and flash devices available to a server the faster that system can process and store data. 
 We use leading edge, state-of-the art components from major technology providers to design purpose-built systems that solve customer problems in an efficient, cost-effective manner. We do not design silicon chips, but instead apply the technology provided by Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital, Broadcom and others to deliver customer driven designs to provide true value to our customers.

Worldwide Sales 
 We provide our products on a worldwide basis and are supported through a network of reseller and distribution partners. Sales in North America and Europe are predominately driven by our direct sales force whereas Asian sales are driven through distributors. In June 2015, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary One Stop Systems, GmbH (“OSS GmbH”), located within the Bressner GmbH facility in Gröbenzell, Germany.
 On October 31, 2018, OSS GmbH acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bressner Technology GmbH, (Bressner) a Germany Limited Liability Company.  This acquisition provides a strong European corporate presence with sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support capabilities.
 Recent Business Initiatives 
 On April 6, 2017, OSS formed SkyScale, LLC (“SkyScale”) to provide high-performance computing through the cloud. SkyScale is a 50/50 joint venture between OSS and Jacoma Investments, LLC, an entity affiliated with a member of our board of directors, which allows customers to lease state-of-the-art high performance computing hardware. This business has contributed only a small amount of revenue to the Company, and the Company is in the process of exiting this business area. 
 On May 9, 2017, OSS entered into an agreement to acquire the source code license to the Ion flash array software from Western Digital. We plan to continue to develop and sell Ion software with our high-density storage arrays, as well as servicing existing Western Digital software users. OSS Ion software works with our all-flash storage systems, and provides a critical point of differentiation with respect to speed and throughput. The OSS Ion software leverages flash storage to accelerate applications and storage-area network performance.   Having the Ion software source code and engineering team on-board allows us to strategically grow our all-flash storage business in the many markets as well as increases our software content over time. 
 On August 31, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Concept Development Inc. (“CDI”) from CDI’s former stockholder (“CDI Stockholder”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”).  CDI specializes in the design and manufacturing of custom high-performance computing systems for airborne in-flight entertainment systems.  CDI is located in Irvine, California. The acquisition is expected to increase the Company’s access to the in-flight entertainment market and gain technical expertise in the design and manufacturing of airborne equipment.  
 The Company paid cash of $646,759 and issued 1,266,364 shares of the Company’s common stock to the CDI Stockholder for 100% of CDI outstanding common stock. The fair value assigned to the shares of common stock was $4,194,673 which was based upon the closing price of OSS’s stock on August 31, 2018 of $3.63 less a discount of 8.75% for lack of marketability for a one year period.
 On October 31, 2018, OSS GmbH, our wholly owned subsidiary, acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bressner Technology GmbH, a Germany limited liability company located near Munich, Germany, from its principal owners for cash consideration of €4,725,000 (US$5,374,582) and stock consideration of 106,463 newly-issued restricted shares of the Company’s common stock. The fair value assigned to the shares of common stock was $220,890 which was based upon the closing price of OSS’s stock on October 31, 2018 of $2.47 less a discount of 13.0% for lack of marketability for a two year period.

 6

 
• | We produce the software required to operate high-capacity, low-latency storage systems used by defense systems and commercial applications and expect this will expand into other products in the future.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our business model generally consists of developing specialized computing solutions that our OEM customers utilize as a major component of the equipment that they sell to end users.
 Our niche is to provide reliable purpose-built platforms with the latest high-performance computing technology.
 Business Strategy 
 We have traditionally followed a strategy of being first-to-market in leading edge technologies by designing and developing products that are delivered before our competitors. This market leader strategy is accomplished through what we term a “Catch the Wave” approach to the market. We currently have products spanning the spectrum of high-performance computing including servers, flash storage, GPU acceleration, networking and PCIe expansion. Within these product areas the OSS “Catch the Wave” approach implies that we: 

• | anticipate trends in these markets;
--+------------------------------------


• | consistently deploy resources in engineering and sales to bring innovative products to market before our competitors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seek to procure early design wins; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | continually monitoring the market for next generation technologies for which a new “Wave” may be forming.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 OSS intends to continue its rapid growth through three avenues: 
  
• | Ramp-up of existing OEM and military design-wins
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Many of our design wins are in the early stages, and we anticipate significant revenue growth as they move into full production. 
  
• | Winning new OEM and military program designs
--+---------------------------------------------

 Our technology leadership provides the “in” to many potential OEM relationships. As we continue to grow the Company, our capabilities and market recognition also grow rapidly, providing even more opportunities for OEM and military program design-ins. 
  
• | Acquisitions of strategic companies
--+------------------------------------

 OSS has an experienced team that has negotiated and managed numerous acquisitions of smaller companies. We have identified a number of firms that we believe have potential to be acquired and could provide significant, accretive value to OSS. Some of the proceeds from our initial public offering have been used in our acquisition activities. 
 7

OSS is using the following criteria for potential acquisition targets: 
  
• | Target has a presence in our served or desired markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Target’s products can be easily integrated into our product portfolio and/or product roadmap resulting in an accretive benefit to our existing position.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target should be profitable with positive cash flow at the outset or shortly following the acquisition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Will consider companies that can extend our markets geographically.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Our Opportunity 
 The worldwide high-performance computing market is expected to grow from $38.4 billion in 2018 to $43.9 billion by 2021. Within this market, OSS is positioned in the highest performance and fastest growing portions of the market including the server (custom and GPU accelerators), storage (flash arrays) and PCIe expansion sectors. Custom Built Servers 

• | GPU Compute Accelerators
--+-------------------------


• | All Flash Arrays
--+-----------------


• | PCIe Expansion and Adaptors
--+----------------------------

Custom Built Servers 
 Within the server sector, OSS has secured a niche position of building purpose-built specialty servers, which the major server suppliers choose not to supply as they require custom tuning and special features that major OEMs cannot easily provide. Such flexibility is difficult to maintain for major suppliers because their systems are not designed to reflect specific customer specifications. OSS on the other hand has continued to find efficient ways service this market profitably.  For example, OSS designs and builds a custom server with custom connectors and 16 high definition video media outputs that are used in the entertainment industry to provide multimedia at a live performance. 
 8

We believe the custom server segment is growing at a greater rate than the standard server segment. Intersect360 Research estimates that the market for high-performance servers is expected to be approximately $14.4 billion by 2021, with corporate market share as follows: 
 
 
Hewlett Packard | 33.0 | %
----------------+------+--
Dell | 26.4 | %
Lenovo | 6.9 | %
IBM | 6.8 | %
Cray | 4.5 | %
ATOS/Bull | 2.6 | %
Inspur | 2.0 | %
Fujitsu | 1.8 | %
Penguin | 1.5 | %
Huawei | 1.2 | %
Others | 13.5 | %

 
It is our experience that OSS is increasingly competitive in the “Others” category, where customers require their systems to meet specific operational specifications, power requirements, speed, latency, or other requirements not covered by traditional designs. We estimate that our addressable market for HPC computers is approximately 20% of the “Others” category in the above chart. This translates to an addressable market size of approximately $389 million with our current engineering capability and product set. Our strategy is to remain focused and be the best in this market segment. 
 GPU Compute Accelerators 
 GPU computing uses hardware components that are optimized to perform mathematical calculations in a rapid fashion. NVIDIA is the market leader in the design and manufacturing of these components. NVIDA has done extremely well in recent years as this part of the computing market is growing much faster compared to the traditional CPUs from companies like Intel.  OSS works closely with NVIDIA to design and build systems which use multiple GPUs to accelerate the applications being run by the computer. 
 The unique design of the GPU provides thousands of processing “cores” which act as individual coprocessors to speed up the calculations on large data sets. GPU acceleration is driving many of the newest and fastest growing technology opportunities in this new age of computing. Many of the applications that are gaining notoriety today have only become possible because of the ability of GPUs to optimize computational throughput, perform many tasks at once, and make sense of the massive amounts of data that is available to high performance algorithms. 
 Markets such as image rendering and processing, self-driving cars, deep learning, molecular modeling and genomics, advanced visualization, machine learning, and image processing, all benefit from the ability to use GPUs to accelerate the application. OSS builds specialized compute accelerators, using the latest GPU technology, to attach to traditional servers used in these emerging growth markets. Because of the relative newness of these markets, little market data exists to precisely define these markets, but we estimate these markets to be very large and growing. While we are beginning from a small base, we expect these markets to be valued in the billions of dollars in the near future. Because our strategy has been to be first-to-market with the fastest and densest compute accelerator appliances, we anticipate our addressable market here to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 
We also have a strong position in the government market which, according to Grandview Research and Intersect360, constitutes 26% of the market that is growing to $46.2 billion by 2021. OSS products can form a basis for companies who wish to participate in the hyper-scale market, which includes deep learning and AI. This is a major technology trend that OSS is addressing through its product roadmap. Intersect360 estimates the deep learning market was worth more than $3.2 billion in 2018 with 41.7% growth projected from 2018 to 2013 resulting in $18.2 billion in 2023 according to MarketsandMarkets.

All Flash Arrays 
 We build flash storage arrays to customer specifications utilizing our unique know-how in packaging, cooling, and PCIe-over-cable. We deliver dense, high-performance systems that provide customers with extreme value and utility in the most demanding, data-intensive operations. 
 Through a strategic agreement with Western Digital, we have acquired the software engineering team and the appropriate source code license for the Ion flash array software.  This provides OSS flash arrays with a high level of differentiation relating to storage management, latency and throughput. Although we maintain an offering of standard flash array products, our expertise and success has been in providing arrays with specialized packaging for demanding applications that are not suitable for standard offerings. 
 For example, we provide products to a large military contractor for integration into a military aircraft that required us to provide a completely new ruggedized mil-spec flash array. This new product provides extreme data density with low weight and a high degree of portability and security for the data. We believe our experience and capability in high speed, low-latency, digital signaling via PCIe gives us an edge in providing these custom designs to OEMs, military programs and other special purpose applications. 
 The overall market for flash arrays is growing rapidly. According to IDC the flash storage market totaled more than $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018, up 55% compared to the same year-ago quarter, and is expected to grow to reach $12 billion by 2022. According to Dell’Oro Group about 82% of the total in the first quarter was attributed to traditional large OEMs, like Dell EMC, NetApp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Pure Storage and IBM. The remaining 18% is addressed by many smaller flash storage providers, including OSS. We believe that because our products are positively differentiated by speed, density, and management features, our offerings compete favorably in this market and provide a substantial growth opportunity. 
 OSS participates in the broader market for dense, high-performance flash storage systems that may or may not be deployed into data center environments. Since we develop custom flash storage arrays, we work closely with both OEMs and end users to insure they receive the product they want in the specific configuration, size and weight required for their application. We believe this gives OSS an advantageous position in a market that is growing rapidly and allows us to favorably compete in the market. 
 PCIe Expansion and Adaptors 
 PCIe (PCI Express) is a high-speed computer expansion standard. This standard defines the signals and connectors (i.e. slots) that are used for computer add-in cards (such as Ethernet or graphics). PCIe signaling can also be routed over a cable, allowing expansion input/output slots to be physically located in a separate chassis. This provides for the highest performance and lowest latency which is essential in this market.
 Being able to route PCIe over a cable facilitates disaggregation of server functionality. That is, with PCIe, certain server functions no longer needed to be contained in the physical server chassis, but could instead be separated and continue to operate at full speed. From a practical perspective, servers could now be connected directly to larger storage arrays or other peripheral devices, with the resulting group of chassis operating as if they were all in the same physical chassis. 
 We began developing our first PCIe-over-cable adaptor in 2006, and were one of the early providers of PCIe adaptors. We recognized this as prime opportunity to utilize our core strengths, such as: 
 
 
• | High-speed board design and layout
--+-----------------------------------


• | Hardware tuning to improve signal integrity
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Design optimization for low cost
--+---------------------------------


• | Rapid design capability
--+------------------------


• | Manufacturing and supply chain management
--+------------------------------------------

 10

This technology has now become a standard within the computer industry, and OSS customers have used our adaptors to connect their custom input/output chassis and achieve performance equivalence as if the input/output was integrated into the server box. This gives designers and integrators a degree of flexibility and utility in architecting computer systems that is unprecedented. For example, one of our customers has utilized PCIe-over-cable to connect its high performance video editing systems to a host computer, providing a system that is optimized for an application using standard servers. We have expanded our PCIe adaptor market in breadth and depth, including making adaptors for many OEM customers. To date, we have shipped more than 100,000 PCIe adaptor cards to customers globally. 
 With our expertise developed in designing adaptor cards, the logical extension of our capability led us to develop a method for expanding the PCIe bus into an external chassis containing one or many expansion slots. This allowed a customer to install multiple standard PCIe boards into a chassis and expand their system without having to add additional servers. A user could now connect a multiplicity of PCIe devices to a single server, and achieve performance and throughput that was not possible prior to the introduction of PCIe. 
 We have been a leader in PCIe expansion backplanes and chassis through generations 1, 2 and 3. As PCIe evolves through generations 4 and 5, we are uniquely positioned to continue our leadership role in this market. We currently offer what we believe to be the largest PCIe expansion product line breadth, with chassis and backplanes that offer expansion from one to 64 slots. Due to its greater data throughput and flexibility of design, we believe this is a growing market, and we intend to maintain our leadership role. 
 Our Technology 
 We design and manufacture high performance computing systems that increase compute performance while reducing cost and impact to the infrastructure. Our high-density compute accelerators connect directly to a server’s PCIe bus, delivering substantial compute performance. Our flash storage arrays support hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage that can also be accessed by multiple servers. 
 Technology Drivers for OSS High-Performance Computing Business 
 OSS has developed expertise and core competencies in the three fundamental technology drivers of today’s high-performance computing market. Namely, high-speed serial interconnect technology, compute acceleration utilizing GPUs, and low latency flash storage. In combination, these technologies are changing the economics of computing, bringing high-performance computing within the grasp of a wide range of new industries and commercial applications. Simultaneously the emergence of massive data being generated in each of these industries is pushing the requirement for state-of-the-art technology. 
 The opportunity is not only to provide competitive advantage for corporations, but also address some of the most fundamental challenges in life science, energy and security. OSS is well situated to leverage these major industry forces. By exploiting its unique set of expertise in the underpinning technologies of high-performance computing, OSS will continue to deliver world leading solutions, with the opportunity to capture a growing market share of this rapidly expanding marketplace. 
 Switched Serial Interconnect 
 Switched serial interconnects are the data highways connecting many elements of today’s high-performance computing platforms. At ever increasing speeds, these pathways move data between system’s processing units, storage, networking, and peripheral elements. For high performance computing the primary processing, storage and peripheral interconnect is PCIe Gen 3. PCIe Gen 3 has an ability to run up to 16 lanes in parallel, which allows up to 16 gigabytes per second bandwidth between system elements. 
 Serial switches incorporated in system design allow many system elements to be connected together in a non-blocking interconnect fabric at PCIe Gen 3 speeds. This allows systems to scale internally avoiding bottlenecks. The serial interconnect can be embedded directly in the computer printed circuit boards, across connectors board-to-board, or traverse across copper or optical cables for chassis-to-chassis connection. Due to the extremely high speeds, the design considerations around signal integrity are rigorous and with unforgiving tolerances. PCIe Gen 4 will begin deployment in 2019, doubling the interconnect speed. 
 11

Serial interconnects are also used to interconnect nodes into larger scale networks and clusters. In this case, the primary interconnects are Infiniband and Ethernet. These technologies have the advantage of scaling to very high numbers of network elements over potentially large distances. The tradeoff over PCIe is higher latency (transit time across the interconnect) and protocol complexity requiring processing cycles to manage. Many high-performance computing deployments incorporate these interconnect technologies in order to deliver large scale solutions with optimized technology selections for each system aspect. In summary, PCIe is used at the local level for the ultimate performance/low latency and these other interconnects are used to expand the network.
 Compute Acceleration with GPUs. 
 Over the last several years, GPUs have evolved from graphics display acceleration to becoming general-purpose processing workhorses for high-performance computing systems. Today, the majority of the fastest supercomputers in the world utilize GPUs as their primary compute engines. GPUs are ideal for high-performance computing workloads because of their ability to do massively parallel processing. While traditional CPUs today may have dozens of processing cores, GPUs have thousands of cores that are all able to execute calculations simultaneously. 
 For many high-performance applications, fundamental pieces of the code can be optimized to run in parallel and therefore experience significant performance enhancements. NVIDIA, a key supplier of GPUs to the market, has done extensive benchmarking showing the ability of single GPU based machines to exceed the performance of dozens or even thousands of traditional CPU-only computers. NVIDIA has worked extensively with the software development community, and hundreds of applications have been tuned and developed to run on GPUs. 
 The current NVIDIA GPU Applications catalog lists more than 400 such applications across a broad set of market spaces including:

 Many of these applications also scale performance based on the number of GPU components utilized. OSS has designed multi-GPU systems including up to 16 GPUs in a single system. Current state-of-the art GPUs provide over 7 teraflops of performance, with future products set to dramatically increase overall processing capabilities in the years to come. 
 Although GPUs provide tremendous application performance advantages, they pose significant system design challenges due to their high power requirements. High-end GPUs can require as much as 350 watts of power, which generates a tremendous amount of heat. Sophisticated power distribution and cooling designs are required, especially for large scale systems with multiple GPUs per chassis.

PCI Express Flash Storage – NVMe protocol
 The use of flash memory technology for system storage has gained traction over the last several years, as the cost per gigabyte has continued to dropFlash memory is now becoming the ubiquitous storage technology in high-performance systems. 
 Combined with the move away from traditional rotating hard drive technology has been the trend toward eliminating traditional storage protocols in favor of low latency flash memory protocols. Newer flash memory modules utilize a protocol known as NVNe, which connects the flash memory directly to the system’s PCIe interconnect. This direct connection allows for very high bandwidth between the storage and the other system elements and eliminates the need for protocol translation as data is moved from storage subsystems to and from the compute complex. 
 Today, flash memory modules with capacities up to 8 terabytes and PCIe Gen 3 interfaces are available. OSS flash storage arrays with hundreds of terabytes of capacity are available, enabling the scaling of high-speed storage to meet the full range of high-performance application requirements. 
 Core Technical Capabilities 
 For 20 years, OSS has developed unique expertise and core competency across the fundamental technologies of today’s rapidly expanding specialized high-performance computing marketplace. These valuable assets are embedded in the leading-edge engineering capabilities of our engineers, the proprietary intellectual property residing in our vast library of designs, and our brand equity based on our reputation as a high-quality producer of state-of-the-art custom and standard solutions across a broad array of markets. 
High Speed System Interconnect Design 
 Our electrical engineers are experts in high speed digital signaling design. They have continually designed at the leading edge of the state-of-the-art signaling speeds, as semiconductor technology has driven up the clock rate of digital transmission. We have consistently been among a small handful of companies able to come to market first with the latest technology. In fact, we delivered the industry’s first PCIe over cable solutions for PCIe Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 and are currently on track to accomplish this again in Gen 4. The expertise required includes circuit design, PCB (printed circuit board) layout and routing optimizations all with a focus on achieving the highest levels of signal integrity. In our current systems, PCIe Gen 3 signals are propagated across multiple PCBs, connectors, and copper cabling while maintaining the ability to recognize digital signal transitions at 8 billion times per second. 
 In high-performance computing systems the trajectory of ever increasing signaling speeds is continuing.  Next generations of PCIe and nvlink will increase signaling rates to 16 and 20 gigahertz (billions of transitions per second).  An ever-shrinking set of companies have the capability to design robust, highly-reliable systems at these speeds. We believe our core competency in large-scale, high-speed design and layout will allow us to remain on the forefront of this growing industry. 
 Complex System Design 
 In addition to low-level signal integrity design expertise, we have amassed expertise and intellectual property in high-performance system architecture design. This expertise allows us to develop extremely sophisticated systems with massive scaling, while meeting customer demands for reliability, cost, and flexibility. 
 We have developed the deep knowledge for high-capacity input/output systems and operating system adjustments and configuration tuning required. Our engineers are often called upon to co-design with OEM designers to create the perfect fit solution for their customers. 
 For highly scalable systems, a deep understanding and experience with switching topologies and interconnect fabric design is required. We have worked with serial switching technology starting with the first generation of PCIe and have been an innovator in creating unique and flexible topologies to meet the specific needs of the customers. Creating custom solutions for unique customer solutions is a core competency and relies on this deep knowledge of switch capabilities and limitations.

For maximum system performance, design for optimizing data transfer speeds is also an important consideration. OSS has developed expertise in system design to leverage peer-to-peer data flows between GPUs and pioneering techniques for optimized data flows between flash storage and GPU compute engines. Our systems optimize switch and GPU configuration topologies to optimize GPU-to-GPU communication without requiring latency-inducing data transfer between host dual processors. Our platforms feature RDMA (remote direct memory access) across compute nodes, which support data transfer without burdening the host CPU. 
 OSS has pioneered the ability to extend the PCIe bus beyond the confines of a single enclosure, opening the possibility of flexible system expansion options. We believe we are one of the leading designers and suppliers of PCIe host bus adapters that extend PCIe signals from the host motherboard across copper or optical cables to expansion enclosures. OSS adapters provide both ends of the external cable connection. Our expertise in high-speed signal design in printed circuit boards, connectors and cables is essential to successful expansion designs. We also hold expertise in incorporating clustering and rack scale expansion into our system designs, including 100 gigabit Ethernet, 100 gigabit Infiniband, and emerging PCIe top-of-rack switch technology. 
 Expertise in power, cooling and mechanical design are required to address the requirements of the high-performance computing customers. We have developed leadership design capability in high-power design and distribution within large rack enclosures. High-end GPUs today require 350 watts or above, and in our high-end systems up to 16 of these can reside in a single chassis. Thousands of kilowatts of redundant power are required. Power stability and huge thermal loads are some of the critical design issues that must be addressed. 
 We have expertise in power distribution, redundant power and complex chassis cooling design, including materials selection, airflow simulation, fan technology and cable routing. We have also developed extensive intellectual property in regulatory compliance of complex high-performance computing system design across emission, shock, vibration, thermal, humidity and other environmental requirements that are required for highly reliable and highly available solutions. OSS engineers are experts in design for regulatory testing for FCC (Federal Communications Commission), CE (European Conformity), UL (Underwriters Laboratories), and Mil-Spec (Military Standard) standards. Additionally, we have expertise in rapid prototyping, design for manufacturability, and design for serviceability. 
 Storage Management Software 
 Given our hardware design and integration expertise, we see the next natural step is to add a robust software capability that will allow us to offer more optimized and customized systems. Our Ion software design team provides the expertise to deliver full server and storage solutions that produce the highest performance from today’s leading-edge flash storage devices. 
 The Ion software allows flash-based modules to be put into a variety of storage and network configurations which can then be accessed by multiple servers. The Ion software can do this cost-effectively, while preserving the low latency that is vital for many business and mission-critical enterprise applications, from database and transaction processing to massive data collection programs. Ion also has a full high-availability option to ensure complete data integrity.

Competition 
 In many cases, our primary competition is actually our potential customer. Our operational model lends itself to understanding technical and physical specifications, completing a rapid design based on our library of over 600 previous designs and prototypes, building a rapid prototype for customer approval, and an efficient design-to-manufacturing process. 
 Most of our OEM customers have sophisticated design capabilities in-house. They come to OSS for our particular expertise and experience, which allows us to work collaboratively with the customer to produce more advanced systems in a shorter timeframe. In most cases, the primary alternative to engaging OSS is for the customer to design the products themselves. We win when our customers realize that together we can produce better products faster and more cost-effectively than they can themselves. This has proven to be particularly evident when customers require state-of-the-art products that are constructed of parts available commercially. This has resulted in several design wins that demonstrate our flexibility and how we can work closely with large OEM and government customers. 
 We also compete with established competitors, third party competitive products and new entrants into the markets we serve. Established competitors include IBM, Lenovo, HP and Dell. Each offers a broad range of standard products and services for this market. In many cases, these companies are able to meet their customer needs thought their standard product offerings. In other cases, these companies work with us to help extend their product capabilities to meet customer-specific requirements. 
 Third party competitive products include cases where the manufacturers of the underlying chip or board-level products decide to also offer system-level products. This is the case with Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital and others. These offerings tend to be tactical, short-term products that are intended to demonstrate a new technology, rather than long-term forays into the systems business. In addition these “technology demonstration systems” tend to be priced at high levels, making them less competitive once the newness factor wears off. 
 New market entrants continue to move into the rapidly evolving high-performance computing space. Some, such as Pure Storage, raise significant amounts of capital and endure huge loses in an attempt to establish market share. 
 Manufacturing and Operations 
 OSS is certified under ISO 9001-20015 for “design, manufacture, and supply of industrial computers.” This means OSS has demonstrated its ability to consistently provide products that meet both customer requirements and applicable regulatory or statutory requirements. It also indicates that we have programs and processes in place to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, as well as a continuous improvement program that ensures OSS gets better over time. 
 We utilize lean principles to drive our manufacturing and assembly process. One of the key aspects of this is our application of just-in-time principles that ensure effective ordering and utilization of inventory, and this helps optimize cash flow throughout the manufacturing cycle. Within the manufacturing process, our operations encompass three categories of “builds:” 
  
• | Standard Builds – These are builds of standard products that are sold with little or no customization or non-standard features. These are products that are ready to be installed or integrated by the customer upon receipt.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Custom Builds – Custom builds involve a product built to a customer specification. Upon receipt, the customer has a unique product that performs all the functions and has the physical dimensions that match their specifications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineering Project Builds – OSS supports the product development process by building models and prototypes of products. Developed by the OSS engineering group, the prototypes can be of standard or custom products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OSS is dedicated to quality and customer satisfaction. Within the manufacturing operations function at OSS, our processes begin with the end goal in mind. This means we start with the customer. All our business processes begin with the idea that the customer is the essence of why we exist. Our continuous improvement efforts require us to review products, services, and processes with the idea that minor changes can lead to greater outcomes for our customers. 
 While we are cognizant of the additive nature of small improvements, we believe a disciplined approach to improvement sometime leads to extraordinary, large, and positive advances in our products and services. This is extremely important to OSS, as our goal is to bring the most advanced leading-edge technologies to our customers before our competitors can. Our operations strategy supports our overall mission of being first to market with customized, leading-edge products that are best-in-market in terms of speed and overall performance. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development at OSS is centered on the exploitation of key technologies as they evolve in the marketplace. Our product roadmap reflects new component technologies for CPUs, GPUs, flash storage, and advanced PCIe switches. We design first-to-market, custom implementations utilizing these component technologies. Accordingly, our focus lies not in the capital-intensive development of silicon implementations of technologies (i.e., chips, processors, GPUs, or storage devices), but rather in taking leading-edge technologies and building first-to-market products that fully exploit those technologies for solving customer problems. 
 The OSS research and development strategy can be summarized as follows: OSS drives design wins by utilizing key new technologies to develop products that are leading edge and first to market.
Some examples of OSS developments:

Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 114 employees or which 112 are full-time and 2 are part-time employees.  Our employees are comprised 90 which are domestic and 24 which are international. Our employees include highly skilled engineers, technicians, assemblers, and support staff. They are housed in multiple facilities, and are led by a management team that is supportive and helpful. We have experienced very little turnover of personnel in the past and endeavor to provide an environment that allows meaningful employee input to all functional areas of the Company. The management team provides transparency to its employees through regular communication meetings designed to update employees on current results and future expectations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. 
Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are in a leased space comprising approximately 24,032 square feet in Escondido, California under a lease that was renewed in August 2018 and now expires in August 2024.  Our headquarters were expanded to accommodate increased manufacturing capacity and to assimilate personnel from a facility on which the Company did not renew its lease. We also lease a 3,208 square foot facility in Salt Lake City, Utah that houses our Ion software development team. CDI is the lessee of approximately 12,000 square feet located in Irvine, California with the lease expiring in June 2021.  Bressner Technology, which was acquired in October 2018, leases space comprising 8,073 square feet which lease expires in December 2019.  
Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be a party to legal proceedings and subject to claims incident in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
