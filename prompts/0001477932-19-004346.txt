Item 1: Business

Background of the Company

MMEX Resources Corporation was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2005. The current management team lead an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed on September 23, 2010 and changed the Company’s name to MMEX Mining Corporation on February 11, 2011. As of April 12, 2016, the Company changed its name from MMEX Mining Corporation to MMEX Resources Corporation to reflect the change in its business plan to an energy focus in the Americas. 

We are a development stage company engaged in the exploration, extraction, refining and distribution of oil, gas, petroleum products and electric power. We plan to focus on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and electric power projects in the Americas using the expertise of our principals to identify, finance and acquire these projects. 

The most significant focus of our current business plan is to build crude oil distillation units and refining facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas (hereinafter referred to as the “Projects”, or the “Distillation Unit” or the “CDU” or the “Refinery”). We intend to implement our current business plan now in several phases, First, through our subsidiary, Pecos Refining, we intend to build and commence operation of one 10,000 bpd crude oil Distillation Unit, now permitted by the TCEQ, that will produce a non-transportation grade diesel primarily for sale in the local market for drilling mud and frac fluids, along with naphtha and residual fuel oil to be sold to other refiners. In additional phases as separate projects we are contemplating building a second and possibly a third CDU with capacity of 10,000 bpd each. A later fourth phase may include the building and operation of the Large Refinery with up to 100,000 bpd capacity in West Texas. We contemplate that these projects will be built on land owned or land being negotiated for purchase by the Company.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Background on Crude Distillation and Refining

Oil refining is the process of separating hydrocarbon molecules present in crude oil and converting them into marketable, finished petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, lubricants and petrochemicals. The crude distillation unit is the first phase of the refining process as shown below.

A crude oil refinery is a group of industrial facilities that turns crude oil and other inputs into finished petroleum products. A refinery's capacity refers to the maximum amount of crude oil designed to flow into the distillation unit of a refinery, also known as the crude unit. The diagram above presents a stylized version of the distillation process. Crude oil is made up of a mixture of hydrocarbons, and the distillation process aims to separate this crude oil into broad categories of its component hydrocarbons, or "fractions." Crude oil is first heated and then put into a distillation column, also known as a still, where different products boil off and are recovered at different temperatures. Lighter products, such as butane and other liquid petroleum gases (LPG), gasoline blending components, and naphtha, are recovered at the lowest temperatures. Mid-range products include jet fuel, kerosene, and distillates(such as home heating oil and diesel fuel). The heaviest products such as residual fuel oil are recovered at temperatures sometimes over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

The simplest refineries stop at this point. Although not shown in the simplified diagram above, most refineries in the United States reprocess the heavier fractions into lighter products to maximize the output of the most desirable products using more sophisticated refining equipment such as catalytic crackers, reformers, and cokers.

The Company CDU’s stop with the simple distillation components and will produce intermediate range products of Naphthas, Diesel and Residual Fuel Oil.

Industry Terminology

Crack Spreads 

Crack spreads are a proxy for refining margins and refer to the margin that would be derived from the simultaneous purchase of crude oil and the sale of refined petroleum products, in each case at the then-prevailing price. The 2-1-1 crack spread assumes two barrels of crude oil will be converted, or “cracked,” into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of heating oil or diesel fuel. Average 2-1-1 crack spreads vary from region to region throughout the United States, depending on the supply and demand balances of crude oils and refined products. 

Actual refinery margins vary from benchmark crack spreads due to the actual crude oils used and products produced, transportation costs, regional differences and the timing of the purchase of the feedstock and sale of light products.

The Company CDU’s will have a crack spread margin that will be based most likely on the differential between the purchase of the crude oil in the area of operations based on a West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) Midland posted price and sale price at the CDU plant site prior to sale. Transportation cost is then deducted depending on the contract term, but the crack spread for the Company CDU will be the margin between the purchase price and the sales price at the CDU plant shipping point. 

Benchmark Crude Oils 

Crude oil pricing is generally quoted in reference to the classification of the crude oil, which is based on certain physical characteristics, the source of its production and the major trading hub with which it is associated. Relevant classifications of crude oil include:

· | West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). WTI is a grade of crude oil that is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content. Cushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for WTI and has been the delivery point for crude oil contracts, and therefore the price settlement point, on the NYMEX for over three decades. The WTI posted price also has a “WTI Midland” posting which reflects pricing of crude oil in the Permian Basin. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Louisiana Light Sweet (“LLS”). LLS is a major benchmark for light, sweet crude oil that is sourced from the Gulf Coast region. It has a slightly higher density and slightly lower sulfur content than WTI. 
· | Brent Crude Oil (“Brent”). Brent is a major trading classification of light, sweet crude oil comprised of Brent, Forties and Oseberg and Ekofisk, which are types of crude oil blends sourced from the North Sea. The Intercontinental Exchange is a major trading hub for Brent. Petroleum suppliers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East often set prices for Brent crude oil according to its value on the Intercontinental Exchange if it is being sold in the Western Hemisphere.

Operating Costs 

Major operating costs for refineries include employee labor, maintenance and energy. Employee labor and maintenance are relatively fixed costs that generally increase in proportion to inflation. By far, the predominant variable cost is energy such as natural gas, electricity and refinery fuel gas. 

CDUs Location

The CDUs will be located in the Permian Basin of Texas. According to the EIA, between January 2016 and March 2017, oil production in the Permian Basin increased in all but three months, even as domestic crude oil prices fell. As production in other regions fell throughout most of 2015 and 2016, the Permian Basin provided a growing share of U.S. crude oil production. 

With rising oil prices over the past several years, the Permian Basin continues to be attractive to drillers, as reflected in rising rig counts. According to the EIA, as of April 21, 2017, the number of rigs in the Permian Basin reached 340, or 40% of the 857 total oil- and natural gas-directed rigs operating in the United States. The Permian Basin rig count reached as high as 568 in late 2014 before falling to a low of 134 in spring 2016 and increasing to 340 in April 2017. According to Baker Hughes, the Permian Basin Rig Count as of July 13, 2018 was 476 active rigs. According to the March 22, 2019 Houston Chronicle “West Texas' booming Permian Basin, which extends into New Mexico, counts 459 rigs all by itself. The Permian makes up 56 percent of all the oil-drilling rigs in the country.”

Recent geological surveys have further explored the resources contained in the Permian Basin. In November 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) estimated that technically recoverable tight oil and shale gas resources in the Midland Basin portion of Texas’ Permian Basin (specifically the Wolfcamp shale formation) could exceed 20 billion barrels of oil, 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 1.6 billion barrels of hydrocarbon gas liquids. The technically recoverable resource estimate for tight oil in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian Basin is higher than any previous USGS assessment of tight oil resources in any domestic resource basin.

Oil production growth in the Permian Basin from 2009-2019 increased by 3,200,000 BPD and is projected to increase by another 2,700,000 BPD by 2024.

The production from these US shale basins, including the Permian Basin, is predominantly light, sweet crude oil, with gravity in excess of 35 degrees API. As a result, coincident with the growth in crude oil from these shale basins, U.S. imports of light crude oil began declining in 2010. 
Outlook for Refining

Recent industry and financial research outline that refining industry fundamentals are more favorable than they have been in a number of years. Morgan Stanley in a recent research report states: 

“A tectonic shift is underway on how new capital investments in refining are being thought about, as even good margins in past three years have not been able to attract major investments on concerns of competition from alternative fuels. We believe this divergence from earlier cycles primes up the refinery industry for the golden age. An overlay of new environmental norms, rising global miles driven (cars, airlines) and improving EM growth just makes margin on refining look stronger than ever.”

Morgan Stanley further comments “20 mega-refiners needed to fulfill demand in the time it takes to build one refinery: The global refining sector represents aboveUS$2 trillion in invested capital and ~US$150bn in planned new investments until 2027, on our estimates. It takes an average of 8-10 years to get a new refinery up and running from the drawing board (See Exhibit below). To put the time frame in context, we estimate we need about 20 new mega-refineries to fulfill the world's demand growth in that timeframe, but, based on the current pipeline, only five will be built. This lag creates cycles, and we see ourselves midway through an upcycle, due to the lack of investments in the past five years. While every cycle has its dynamics, what makes the current upcycle different is the lack of new investment committed despite the last three years of strong margins, due to concerns over the long-term shift in global energy demand from renewables and EVs.”

To compare the Company CDU project, we project a 3.5-year time from idea to production with the CDU at a cost of approximately $100 Million per CDU. 

IMO 2020

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) will enforce a new 0.5% global sulphur cap on fuel content from 1 January 2020, lowering from the present 3.5% limit. The global fuel sulphur cap is part of the IMO's response to the heightening environmental concerns, contributed in part by harmful emissions from ships.

The impact of IMO 2020 will be enormous: industry reports suggest the new rule will require as much as 3 MMb/d of high-sulfur bunker fuel oil to be replaced by low-sulfur alternatives. According to the International Energy Agency's 2018 five-year oil market outlook, about 30% of the new demand for IMO 2020-compliant marine fuel will be met by marine gasoil, a middle distillate designed for ship engines, and another 30% will be met by new 0.5%-sulfur fuel oil blends created from existing 1%-or-less low-sulfur fuels and middle distillates such as ultra-low-sulfur diesel. The remaining 40% of the bunker market is expected to continue using existing high-sulfur fuel blends. Some vessels will use specially installed scrubbers that treat emissions to remove sulfur and other toxins from engine exhaust. A very small number of vessels will be fitted or built to use liquefied natural gas (LNG). Others will simply not comply with the new rule, at least initially, taking the risk that policing on the high seas will be difficult.

The IMO 2020 sulfur regulations are a significant consideration in the Company’s business plan, as we will be producing 28% of the input crude oil as residual fuel oil that is below the 5% sulfur standard. Residual fuel oil has become a highly sought-after product and is the primary mover behind the development of the 2nd CDU, principally at the recommendation of our proposed Off-taker for the residual. With the first and second unit combined we are planning to deliver by rail approximately 168,000 Bbls per month of IMO 2020 compliant residual fuel oil by 200 rail cars to the Texas Gulf Coast markets identified by our proposed Off-taker.
Current Business Operations and Strategy

The Company’s business plan has evolved into several additional potential components.


¨ | The addition of a 2nd CDU at our present site and potentially a 3rd CDU at another location 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
¨ | Adding a Crude by Rail transportation and export component 
¨ | Adding a Hydrotreater as separate component to produce transportation grade diesel 
¨ | Development of a Terminal and Storage facility on the Texas Gulf Coast 
¨ | Organization of a Trading Company for exporting physical petroleum products to Latin American markets
¨ | Associated gas and gas liquids treating 
¨ | Development of a Solar Project to power the Projects by solar energy 


The most significant focus of our current business plan is to build crude oil distillation and refining facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We intend to commence operations with a 10,000 bpd Distillation Unit that will produce a non-transportation grade diesel primarily for sale in the local market for drilling mud and frac fluids, along with naphtha and heavy fuel oil to be sold to other refiners.

Additional CDU Opportunities In additional phases as separate projects we are contemplating building a second and possibly a third CDU with capacity of 10,000 bpd each. A later fourth phase may include the building and operation of the Large Refinery with up to 100,000 bpd capacity in West Texas. We contemplate that these projects will be built on land owned or land being negotiated for purchase by the Company. The Company is focusing on the Distillation Unit first in an effort to build and commence operations, and ultimately generate cash flow, on an expedited basis. The permitting process is significantly shorter for construction of the Distillation Unit and the first one was received by the Company on August 30, 2017. We expect the permitting process to be similar for the additional Distillation Units. The permitting process for the Large Refinery, if pursued, is expected to be 12-18 months. 

The Company currently estimates that construction costs for the Distillation Unit, inclusive of the potential Crude by Rail (see below), will be approximately $105 million. The second and third unit, if built, is estimated to cost in the range of $75 million each. According to a report the Company received from KP Engineering, the cost of a 50,000- bpd refinery is estimated to be approximately $500 million and the cost of a 100,000-bpd refinery is estimated to be approximately $850 million. These estimates are only preliminary estimates and are subject to substantial change when additional detailed engineering is completed. 

These projects will be built on acreage located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad. If successfully developed, the CDUs would connect to existing railways and pipelines to market diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas and other refined products within the U.S., with the potential to market these products and crude oil to western Mexico and South America. If completed, the Large Refinery will be one of the first full scale oil refineries built in the United States in more than 40 years. 

Crude by Rail We are actively considering the inclusion in our Distillation Unit projects of a crude oil storage and dispatch facility (RSD). The RSD facilities will be constructed as part of the CDUs. We propose to charge a per barrel fee to receive, store and dispatch crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast markets. 
Hydrotreater We are also considering adding a distillate hydrotreater component to the two CDUs as a separate project. The distillate hydrotreater is a category of hydrotreaters that treats distillate streams from atmospheric distillation units to reduce their sulfur content and to improve their properties for blending into diesel. This would allow CDU’s to produce transportation grade diesel for the Permian Basin market. We have initiated a preliminary feasibility study. The separate Hydrotreater component, if built, is estimated to cost approximately $25 million

Constructing the CDUs and Hydrotreater will require a significant number of governmental permits and approvals. On August 30, 2017, we received approval from the TCEQ for the air quality permit for the 1st Distillation Unit. We plan to file for additional permits with TCEQ as may be required. According to VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering, and Saulsbury Industries, our two EPC contractors, the construction for the 1st Distillation Unit would take approximately 12 to 15 months from the date the Notice to Proceed is issued by the Company, which cannot be issued until the financing is completed. The 2nd and 3rd CDU’s will take approximately the same amount of time from the date of the Notice to Proceed, which will be dependent on receiving TCEQ permit approvals and the closing of financing. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Large Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of the air quality permit. 

Texas Gulf Coast Terminal and Storage Facilities Transportation and delivery of products by rail has opened up for the Company an opportunity to acquire potentially storage space in existing terminal facilities in the Texas Gulf Coast area with access to water for export of petroleum products including crude oil. We are in active negotiation with terminal owners and potential joint venture partners for the terminal site, the storage tanks and the financing. If built, the Company operated storage facilities on the Texas Gulf Coast will enhance the marketing activities of the Company. 
Trading Company The Company is considering a potential joint venture with international partners to begin a physical trading operation of petroleum products into Mexico, Panama and potentially other Central and Latin America locations. If we are successful in implementing the trading opportunities this will add to the Company’s marketing expansion plans. 

The cost of construction for all of these components is very significant and we intend to finance 100% of such costs through debt and equity offerings. See “Business—Proposed Organizational Structure.” 

Marketing We plan on marketing and distributing refined products in the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Western areas of the United States and Mexico, and we may export product to Latin America. We have signed three off-take agreements with significant balance sheet purchasers. The diesel produced by the Distillation Unit will be marketed and sold locally, primarily for use in drilling mud and frac fluids, and likely transported by truck or by existing railroad systems. If the Hydrotreater is built, the diesel purchaser has indicated that it will purchase all of the transportation grade diesel produced by the 2 CDUs and the Hydrotreater. The ATBs and Naphthas produced by the CDU’s will be marketed and sold to a Super Major International Petroleum and Trading company under two separate signed agreements providing for the right to purchase all additional production. We will deliver these products by rail to the destination points the buyer designates on the Texas Gulf Coast. Our location with rail access from the Texas Pacifico Railroad with interconnections to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe RR, the Union Pacific RR, the Fort Worth and Western RR and the Kansas City Southern RR is a key component to our transportation and market access. 

The Projects will be located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route 20 miles Northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. Once needed repairs are finished to the tracks and railway, the Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex RR in Ojinago, Mexico, giving us access to the western Mexico markets. 

The Texas Department of Transportation owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. The Texas Pacifico Railroad entails approximately 371 miles of track and interchanges or has trackage rights with BNSF Railway the Union Pacific Railroad and Fort Worth and Western Railroad, which in turn have interchanges or trackage rights with the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad is operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. Our planned Project is located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route approximately 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex Railroad at Ojinaga, Mexico.

Associated Gas and Liquids Treating Along with the crude oil production in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford, tremendous amounts of associated natural gas and natural gas liquids are being produced and without markets, is being flared into the atmosphere allowing producers to continue the crude oil production. It is estimated that 740 million cubic feet per day are being flared, which represents $1.8 million per day cost at current prices. That produces the equivalent green-house gas from 5 million cars driving per day according to the World Bank and the Environmental Protection Agency. The output of gas is projected to increase over 30% in the next five years according to the consultancy RBN Energy. Wall Street Journal July 18, 2019 (Rebecca Elliott) 


The Company wants to be able to offer crude oil producers in the Permian Basin, particularly those near our location, a way to process their liquid-rich “associated” gas produced in tandem with the crude oil and the Company has commissioned an engineering consulting firm to present what technologies exist for small-scale, modular natural gas treating close to the wellhead and what the expected capital and operating expenses. We have also asked the consultancy to develop a capital and operating expense estimate to turn the produced gas into diesel fuels via a Fischer-Tropsch facility. Should these processes be economically viable and the Company able to finance and develop them, this may be another very strong business plan addition.

Solar Project We have also commenced initial discussions regarding a solar power project to be located on leased acreage near the Refinery. If successfully financed and completed, we would expect to utilize a portion of the generated power for the Refinery, with the balance to be sold into the Texas grid. There is no assurance that the solar power project will be financed or constructed.
Financing The Company is currently negotiating the financing for the Projects. There is no assurance that the required debt and equity financing for the Projects will be obtained.
Management Expertise in Oil, Gas, Refining and Electric Power Project Development and Project Finance Development

As of 2016, the Board of Directors has decided to focus the Company’s efforts in the oil, gas, refining and electric power business in the U.S. and in Latin America. The principal reasons behind this focus is to capitalize on the experience and expertise of the MMEX management team, its directors and principal stockholders. MMEX management has over 30 years of experience in natural resource project development and project financing in North and South America and the U.K. In addition, MMEX directors and principal stockholders with oil, gas, refining and electric power experience will bring this expertise into the Company.

MMEX principals formed Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple Resources”) in 1986 to engage in the evaluation, acquisition and development of oil & gas, refining, power generation, natural gas transmission and processing energy projects in the western United States and Latin America. Maple Resources and its principals have engaged in a number of oil and gas acquisitions and dispositions and ultimately acquired assets that included 10 gas processing plants and approximately 770 miles of natural gas gathering lines and transmission infrastructure. In 1992, Maple Resources sold substantially all of its existing US-based assets and began to pursue energy projects in Latin America, particularly in Peru through its affiliate The Maple Gas Corporation del Peru Ltd (“Maple Peru”). In 1993, Maple Peru began developing the Aguaytía Project, an integrated natural gas and electric power generation and transmission project. This US$273 million project involved the first commercial development of a natural gas field in Peru, as well as the construction and operation of approximately 175 miles of hydrocarbon pipelines, a gas processing plant, a fractionation facility, a 153 MW power plant and the related 392 km of electricity transmission lines. The Aguaytía Project began commercial operation in 1998. Maple Peru also acquired a 4,000-bpd refinery in Pucallpa along with 3 producing oil fields.

Jack Hanks, our President and CEO, is no longer engaged in the active business operations of Maple Peru and is able to devote substantially all of his business time to his duties on behalf of the Company. Further, we do not anticipate that Maple Resources will present any conflicts of interest for the MMEX principals in carrying out their responsibilities on behalf of the Company. 

Proposed Organizational Structure

The Company expects to operate the Projects through its subsidiary, Pecos Refining, and to operate the Large Refinery through another subsidiary set up for such purpose. Currently, Pecos Refining is wholly-owned by the Company and the Company serves as its sole manager. However, the construction of the Distillation Units, Hydrotreater, Terminals, Trading and other components and the Large Refinery will require substantial equity and debt financing, far beyond the expected resources of the Company, and we anticipate that the Subsidiaries will obtain equity and debt financing to finance the cost of construction. To the extent these Subsidiaries raise money through the issuance of equity securities, our ownership in the Subsidiaries will be diluted and our economic ownership of such entities may be a minority interest. As such, we will be entitled to only a portion of any future distributions made by these Subsidiaries. In addition, while intend to retain managerial control of the Subsidiaries, it is possible that equity investors will require representation on the board of managers in connection with their equity investments.

We anticipate these Subsidiaries will be able to finance approximately 65 to 70% of the total costs of the Distillation Units and the Large Refinery through debt financing, and the remaining 35 to 30% of the total costs would be financed through equity investments. We intend to pursue the required debt financing from banks or other large institutional investors. Traditionally, such debt financing is in the form of project financing, which among other terms will require the Subsidiary borrow to restrict its activities to the operation of the project financed by the lender, to pledge all assets of the project to the lender and to be subject to restrictive financial covenants. Such lenders further typically require engineering, marketing and feasibility studies as a condition precedent to the financing. In order to attract the significant capital necessary to build the Refinery, the Company will have to fund the cost of these reports and studies, likely out of equity raises. We have estimated that such cost will aggregate approximately $500,000. 

Location and Logistics

The Refinery will be located in the Permian Basin, which holds some of the largest tapped and untapped oil and gas reserves in the world. The Permian Basis is located principally in West Texas. While production in the Permian Basin in the past had been in decline, the development of hydraulic fracturing in shale zones reversed the trend, and the cost of developing oil and gas reserves from shale formations (the driver of recent US increases in production) is lower in the Permian Basin than in other areas of the US. For this reason, the activity in the Permian Basin has recently been expanding and drawing the interest of major oil and gas companies. We believe that the Permian Basin will be the major domestic producing region in the country for decades to come. 

The Projects will be located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad and in the Permian Basin. The currently owned site consists of 126 acres and another 119 acres is under contract and the rail line runs through a corner of the owned property.

There are six refineries in the Permian Basin located at El Paso, Texas; McKee, Texas; Borger, Texas; Big Spring, Texas; and Artesia, New Mexico. The total capacity of these refineries is 640,500 bpd. These refineries are older refineries designed to process historic production from the Permian Basin. As such, these refineries do not take high-API production or discount it significantly, such as the production being produced from the hydraulically-fractured shale zones in which the current increase in production is occurring in the Permian Basin. Moreover, the increasing amount of shale oil production has outpaced these refineries’ ability to process the new crude oil production. For these reasons, much of the new shale production is currently being exported out of the Permian Basin. Significant infrastructure improvements have been developed and announced to move Permian Basin production to the Texas Gulf Coast. According to the EIA, these infrastructure improvements have and will decrease the discount to WTI pricing that has often plagued the sale of Permian Basin shale crude in the recent past. The Company believes that while the construction of crude oil pipelines from the Permian Basin to the significant refining infrastructure in the Texas Gulf Coast will and have decreased discounts, trucking and pipeline companies will charge fees to transport the new shale production out of the Permian Basin, resulting, in effect, in a continued discount for such production, compared to the delivered price to our Projects. 

The Projects will be located near the major producing shale areas of the Permian Basin in Reeves and Pecos counties. The estimates of crude production and potential production from “drilled uncompleted” wells in our area far exceed the 20,000 BPD capacity of the proposed two CDU’s (see below). The crude oil purchase offers are subject to substantial conditions and there is no assurance that the purchase arrangements can be successfully implemented. But the Company believes there are a number of alternative means of delivering the ever-increasing supply of oil shale production from the Permian Basin to the Refinery site, whether by truck, construction of gathering pipelines by another company or by rail. There are 4,002 Drilled Uncompleted ("DUCs") wells in the Permian Basin according to the EIA Drilling Productivity Report, DUC Wells by Region, July 15, 2019.

Transportation

We will likely be transporting refined products primarily by rail. Both the U.S. Department of Transportation and its agency, the Federal Railroad Administration, have issued regulations pertaining to the shipment of crude oil and refined products. In addition, TxDOT has its own set of regulations pertaining to these matters, and Mexico will have additional regulations governing the transport of refined products and crude oil. As part of the construction of the Refinery, we will develop procedures and policies in connection with our shipping partners and buyers to comply with all relevant regulations. 

We intend to transport the diesel production from our Distillation Unit by truck or by existing railroad systems within the Permian Basin for use in drilling fracking markets. We intend to transport other of our refined products, principally ATBs and naphtha, to other refineries, primarily in the Port Arthur, Beaumont, Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas areas, by pipeline and existing railroad systems for further processing. 

TxDOT owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. The Texas Pacifico Railroad entails approximately 371 miles of track and interchanges with BNSF Railway, the Union Pacific Railroad and Fort Worth and Western Railroad, which in turn connects into the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad is operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. Our planned Projects are located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route approximately 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex Railroad at Ojinaga, Mexico. 

We plan to transport refined product on the Texas Pacifico Railroad and significant investments are required to upgrade the railroad. TxDOT owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. There are two significant infrastructure improvement projects that TxDOT must be complete before we will be able to use the Texas Pacifico Railroad to transport our production to Mexico as we have planned. 

The international railroad bridge, located at the southwestern end of the rail line connecting Presidio, TX to Ojinaga, Mexico burned on two separate occasions, February 29, 2008 and March 1, 2009. TxDOT and Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, the company that operates the Texas Pacifico Railroad, has rebuilt the bridge allowing access to Mexico and increased business potential. On August 4, 2017, Tx DOT announced a $7 million federal grant from The U.S. Department of Transportation to strengthen existing rail infrastructure in Permian Basin. As announced on August 4, the funds were used to rebuild the Presidio-Ojinaga International Rail Bridge and 72 miles of track on the South Orient Rail Line that run from the Mexico border to near Coleman, Texas owned by the state of Texas but maintained and operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation, Ltd. under a lease with TxDOT. 

In addition, the railroad track between Alpine and Presidio may be upgraded as traffic requires through the area. The upgrade capital improvements required on the Texas Pacifico Railroad to transport significant volumes of traffic are estimated by TxDOT to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million. Our ultimate business plan to market refined products into Western Mexico and to export refined products to Latin America will depend upon the capital investment on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. There is no assurance that these capital improvements will be made. If these capital improvements are not made, our business prospects for Mexico exports on the TXPF could be materially negatively impacted. The funding by TxDOT and Texas Pacifico/Ferromex for the completion of the international bridge at Presidio/Ojinaga, which has now occurred, is a very positive sign that upgrades to the Texas Pacifico line from Fort Stockton to Presidio are to follow the freight traffic commitments to and from Mexico-otherwise it becomes a “bridge to nowhere”.

The Company business plan may also include marketing diesel, gasoline and other refined products in the western areas of Mexico and to transport those products along Grupo Mexico’s/Ferromex rail lines to the Mexican port of Topolobampo located on the Gulf of Mexico for export to Latin America. This business plan depends on the completion of the track upgrades and the completion of the bridge at Presidio/Ojinaga. The Company believes that the market exists in Western Mexico and in Latin America for the refined products that it plans to ship, but it has no arrangements currently in place to market and sell its products in those areas. 

With the proposed Company terminal and storage facilities and the trading company operations, the Company will have additional rail and ship/barge access to eastern Mexico areas and to other Latin America destinations from the Texas Gulf Coast. The Company believes that the market exists in Eastern Mexico and in Latin America for the refined products that it plans to ship, but it has no arrangements currently in place to market and sell its products in those areas.

Construction of the Projects

The Distillation Units would cover approximately 15 acres each of the 126 acres property which is owned. The Company is under contract to purchase an additional 119 acres. One or more of the CDU’s and the rail facilities are planned for both properties. The Large Refinery, if built, would cover approximately 250 acres which is not owned currently. Before construction of any of the Projects can commence, the Company must obtain all required permits. Constructing of the Projects will require a significant number of governmental permits and approvals. The principal permit for the construction of the Projects is the air quality permit issued by TCEQ and significant construction will not begin until we have received it. On August 30, 2017, we received approval from the TCEQ for the air quality permit for the 1st Distillation Unit. Trinity Consultants, the Company’s air quality permit advisor, estimates it will take approximately 15 to 18 months to obtain the air quality permit for the Large Refinery, once filed. The other principal permits for the Projects that will be required are the following:

We have not yet filed for any of the foregoing permits.

The Company has hired VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering and Saulsbury Industries (the “EPCs”) with respect to the construction of the 1st CDU. The total indicated cost estimate including continencies and owner costs plus or minus 10% is $105 Million for the 1st CDU. Once we close on the financing and issue the notice to proceed, the completion and start-up date guaranteed by the EPCs is 15 months. We expect the 2nd CDU to be less in cost than the 1st CDU and the Hydrotreater capex to be in the range of $25,000,000. The total indicated cost of the 1st CDU, the 2nd CDU and the Hydrotreater is in the range of $200 million.

The Company has hired KP Engineering to advise it with respect to the construction of the Refinery. KP Engineering has prepared a preliminary report regarding the estimated cost and time-line for construction of the Refinery. KP Engineering has estimated the cost of a 50,000-bpd refinery to be approximately $500 million and the cost of a 100,000 bpd refinery to be approximately $850 million. These estimates are only preliminary estimates and are subject to substantial change when additional engineering is completed. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Large Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of the air quality permit. 

Building a complex refinery is a costly and time-consuming process. The preliminary report from KP Engineering must be followed by other detailed engineering reports. But these reports are all essential to the financing of the construction and development of the Refinery.

Employees

As of April 30, 2019, we had no employees and our executive officer, and our two directors had not received any compensation. We contract for all professional services when needed.
Legal Proceedings

There are no legal proceedings against the Company.

Environmental Regulations Pertaining to Refinery Operations. 

The operations of the Refinery will be subject to complex and frequently-changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials. As with the industry generally, compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance, capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they affect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. Violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. We will adopt policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal, state and local levels, and the legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
Clean Air Act. 

The environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Refinery include permitting and monitoring activities relating to air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act, and its implementing regulations, as well as comparable state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with these rules can result in severe penalties and potential shut down of facilities. We will be required to develop policies and procedures to comply with all these laws and regulations. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 

Various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane emissions, are in different phases of implementation and discussion. At the federal legislative level, both houses of Congress have considered legislation to reduce GHG emissions, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap-and-trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable or “clean” energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency in energy supply and use. A number of states, both individually and on a regional basis, have adopted measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions, including statewide GHG inventories and regional GHG cap-and-trade initiatives. The EPA has also begun to regulate GHG emissions under the authority granted to it by the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including petroleum refineries. The implementation of EPA regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. Increased costs associated with compliance with any current or future legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for our business but also for our customers, thereby potentially decreasing demand for our products and services. Decreased demand for our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Release of Hazardous Substances. 

Environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations also relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the soil, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. There are risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 
CERCLA. 

The Refinery property and any wastes disposed therefrom may be subject to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and comparable Texas state laws. CERCLA and comparable state laws may impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons regarding the presence or release of a hazardous substance in (or into) the environment, which may include the disposal of wastes generated by the Refinery, even if the wastes are taken from the Refinery by others and disposed by them. We will develop procedures and policies to ensure compliance with these laws. 

Our operations may potentially result in the discharge of regulated substances, including crude oil, refined products, or natural gas liquids. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of regulated substances into waters of the United States or state waters. We will develop policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these rules. 

Renewable Identification Numbers. 

In 2007, the EPA promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”), which requires refiners to blend “renewable fuels” in with their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), in lieu of blending. Under the Clean Air Act the EPA is required to determine and publish the applicable annual renewable fuel percentage standards for each compliance year by November 30 of the prior year. However, the EPA has repeatedly missed that deadline. The percentage standards represent the ratio of renewable fuel volume to gasoline and diesel volume. For all domestically-sold gasoline and diesel fuels we produce at the Refinery, we will be required to blend renewable fuels into our gasoline and diesel fuel or purchase RINs in lieu of blending. The Refinery intends to purchase RINs on the open market or waiver credits from the EPA to comply with the RFS. While we cannot predict the future prices of RINs or waiver credits, the price of RINs can be extremely volatile. RINs will constitute a genuinely significant cost of operations for the Refinery relative to domestically-sold gasoline and diesel, which is why we intend to export gasoline and diesel to the fullest extent possible. 

If the Refinery’s gasoline or diesel is sold domestically, we and other similarly-situated refiners may become more reliant on the purchase of RINs and waiver credits on the open market to comply with the RFS in the future. The cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the volume mandates set by EPA, the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels and the mix of our petroleum products, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, numerous instances of fraudulent RINs being made available on the market have led EPA to impose penalties on RIN purchasers, even those with no knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the RINs. If we purchase invalid RINs, or fail to properly keep records in accordance with EPA’s rules and regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties.

Safety, Security and Insurance Concerns in Operating Refineries. 

The Refinery will be subject to the Department of Homeland Security’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities, and to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. We will have to have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements, and we will need to develop a Facility Security Plan as required under the relevant law. We will also have to have in place procedures to monitor compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of all our facilities.

The Refinery will also be subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We will also be subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We will take measures to ensure that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
