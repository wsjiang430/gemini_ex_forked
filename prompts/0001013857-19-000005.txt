ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We develop, market, license, and support enterprise software applications that help organizations transform the way they engage with their customers and process and complete work across their enterprise. We license our no-code Pega Platform™ for rapid application development to clients that wish to build and extend their own business applications. Our cloud-architected portfolio of customer engagement and digital process automation applications leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”), case management, and robotic automation technology, built on our unified no-code Pega Platform, empowering businesses to quickly design, extend, and scale their enterprise applications to meet strategic business needs.
To grow our business, we intend to: 

• | grow market share by developing and delivering market-leading applications for marketing, sales, service, and operations that can work together seamlessly with maximum differentiation and minimal customization;


• | execute new-market growth initiatives, further expanding sales coverage within the Global 3000; and


• | continue to scale our digital platform and invest in awareness marketing to support the way today’s clients want to buy products and services.

Whether we are successful depends, in part, on our ability to:

• | successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies;


• | appropriately manage our expenses as we grow our organization;


• | effectively develop new products and enhance our existing products; and


• | successfully incorporate acquired technologies into our applications and unified Pega Platform.

Our Products
Pega Infinity™, the latest version of our platform, helps connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, streamline business operations, and adapt to meet changing requirements. 
Our applications and platform intersect with and encompass several software markets, including: 

• | Customer Engagement, including Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”);


• | Digital Process Automation (“DPA”), including Business Process Management (“BPM”);

5


• | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”);


• | Business Rules Management Systems (“BRMS”);


• | Dynamic Case Management (“DCM”);


• | Decision Management, including predictive and adaptive analytics;


• | No-code and low-code application development platforms, including Mobile Application Development Platforms (“MADP”); and


• | Vertical-Specific Software (“VSS”) market of industry solutions and packaged applications.

Customer engagement
Our omni-channel customer engagement applications are designed to maximize the lifetime value of customers and help reduce the costs of serving customers while ensuring a consistent, unified, and personalized customer experience. At the center of our customer engagement applications is the Pega Customer Decision Hub™, our real-time AI engine, which can predict a customer’s behavior and recommend the “next-best-action” to take across channels in real-time.

• | Pega Marketing™ is designed to enable enterprises to improve customer acquisition and experiences across inbound, outbound, and paid media channels. It incorporates AI in the form of predictive and machine-learning analytics, as well as business rules, and executes these decisions in real-time to evaluate the context of each customer interaction and dynamically deliver the most relevant action, offer, content, and channel.


• | Pega Sales Automation™ automates and manages the entire sales process, from prospecting to product fulfillment. It allows enterprises to capture best practices, and leverages AI to guide sales teams through the sales and customer onboarding processes.


• | Pega Customer Service™ is designed to anticipate customer needs, connect customers to the right people and systems, and automate or intelligently guide customer interactions, to rapidly and continuously evolve the customer service experience and to allow enterprises to deliver consistent interactions across channels and improve employee productivity. The application consists of a contact center desktop, case management for customer service, chat, knowledge management, mobile field service, omni-channel self-service, AI-powered virtual assistants, and industry-specific processes and data models.

Digital process automation
We offer industry-specific software applications built on the Pega Platform. These applications provide businesses with robust capabilities to automate industry-specific business processes. As they are built on the Pega Platform, these applications deliver flexibility beyond traditional, “off-the-shelf” products. Our applications allow our clients to offer differentiated service and value to their customers. The Pega Platform empowers organizations to implement new processes quickly, refine customer experiences, bring new offerings to market, and provide customized or specialized automated processing.
Our Capabilities
We drive better business outcomes in two ways: 

• | Making decisions: delivering real-time customer engagement, powered by real-time, omni-channel AI


• | Getting work done: making customer and employee-facing processes more efficient through end-to-end automation and robotics

Real-time, omni-channel AI 
AI has been around for many years, in many forms, yet only in the past decade have businesses started using its practical applications, fueled by the new abundance of data to power decisions and ever-increasing customer expectations. Our customer engagement and other applications built on the Pega Platform leverage predictive and adaptive analytics to deliver more personalized customer experiences and maximize business objectives. The Pega Customer Decision Hub, a centralized, always-on “brain”, unleashes the power of predictive analytics, machine learning, and real-time decisioning across our clients’ data, systems, and touchpoints - orchestrating engagement across customer interaction channels.
End-to-end robotic automation 
We bring together both human-assisted robotic desktop automation and unattended robotic process automation with our unified DPA and case management capabilities. This gives our platform and applications the ability to automate both customer-facing and back-office operational processes from “end-to-end”, connecting across organizational and system silos to seamlessly connect customers and employees to successful customer experiences.
Journey-centric rapid delivery
Our customer engagement and DPA solutions are designed to improve targeted customer outcomes, quickly and with out-of-the-box functionality that connects enterprise data and systems to customer experience channels. From there, organizations can scale, one customer experience at a time, to realize greater value while delivering increasingly consistent and personalized customer experiences.

Software That Writes Your Software®
Our approach bypasses the error-prone and time-consuming process of manually translating requirements into code. Users design software in no-code visual models that reflect the needs of the business. The software application is created and optimized automatically and directly from the model, helping to close the costly gap between vision and execution. Changes to the code are made by altering the model, and application documentation is generated directly from the model. The Pega Platform is standards-based and can leverage a client’s existing technology to create new business applications that cross technology silos and bridge the front and back-office. 
Unified future-proof platform
We offer a unified DPA platform, combining robotics, process automation, and case management together in a unified architecture. We build in powerful decision analytics, designed to allow our clients to automate any process while working faster and smarter. Our no-code architecture is designed to empower organizations to scale across all dimensions of their business, including product lines, departments, and geographies, by reusing components and avoiding the traditional method of deploying multiple customer engagement and DPA instances that lead to even more silos and disjointed customer experiences.
Cloud choice
Pega Cloud® allows clients to develop, test, and deploy, on an accelerated basis, our applications and the Pega Platform using a secure, flexible internet-based infrastructure, minimizing cost while focusing on core revenue generating competencies.
The Pega Platform and applications are deployable on other cloud architectures, including client or partner-managed clouds. This cloud choice gives our clients the ability to select, and change as needed, the best cloud architecture for the security, data access, speed-to-market, and budget requirements of each application they deploy.

Competition
The markets for our offerings are intensely competitive, rapidly changing, and highly fragmented, as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report for additional information.
We encounter competition from: 

• | Customer engagement, including CRM application vendors;


• | DPA, including BPM vendors, no-code and low-code application development platforms, and service-oriented architecture middleware vendors;

• | Professional service organizations that develop their own products or create custom software in conjunction with rendering consulting services; and


• | Clients’ in-house information technology departments, which may seek to modify their existing systems or develop their own proprietary systems.

Competitors vary in size, scope, and breadth of the products and services they offer and include some of the largest companies in the world, such as Salesforce.com, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE, and International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”).
We have been most successful competing for clients whose businesses are characterized by a high degree of change, complexity, or regulation. We believe the principal competitive factors within our market include:

• | product adaptability, scalability, functionality, and performance;


• | proven success in delivering cost-savings and efficiency improvements;


• | proven success in enabling improved customer interactions;


• | ease-of-use for developers, business units, and end-users;


• | timely development and introduction of new products and product enhancements;


• | establishment of a significant base of reference clients;


• | ability to integrate with other products and technologies;


• | customer service and support;


• | product price;


• | vendor reputation; and


• | relationships with systems integrators.

We believe we are competitively differentiated as our unified Pega Platform is designed to allow client business and IT staff, using a single, intuitive user interface, to build and evolve enterprise applications in a fraction of the time it would take with disjointed architectures and tools offered by our competitors. In addition, our applications, built on the Pega Platform, provide the same level of flexibility and ability to adapt to our clients’ needs as our Pega Platform. We believe we compete favorably due to our expertise in our target industries and our long-standing client relationships. We believe we compete less favorably on some of the above factors against our larger competitors, many of which have greater sales, marketing, and financial resources, more extensive geographical presence, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage against our larger competitors with respect to our ability to provide expertise outside our target industries.
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secrets laws, as well as confidentiality and intellectual property agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have obtained patents relating to our system architecture and products in strategic global markets. We enter into confidentiality, intellectual property ownership, and license agreements with our employees, partners, clients, and other third parties. We also control access to and ownership of software, services, documentation, and other proprietary information to protect our proprietary rights. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell our software and services primarily through a direct sales force. In addition, strategic partnerships with management consulting firms and major systems integrators are important to our sales efforts, because they influence buying decisions, help us identify sales opportunities, and complement our software and services with their domain expertise and consulting capabilities. We also partner with technology providers and application developers.
To support our sales efforts, we conduct a broad range of marketing programs, including awareness advertising, client and industry-targeted solution campaigns, trade shows, including our PegaWorld® user conference, solution seminars and webinars, industry analyst and press relations, web and digital marketing, community development, social media presence, and other direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our consulting employees, business partners, and other third parties also conduct joint and separate marketing campaigns that generate sales leads for us.

assurance. Our product development priority is to continue expanding the capabilities of our technology. We intend to maintain and extend the support of our existing applications, and we may choose to invest in additional strategic applications which incorporate the latest business innovations. We also intend to maintain and extend the support of popular hardware platforms, operating systems, databases, and connectivity options to facilitate easy and rapid deployment in diverse IT infrastructures. Our goal with all products is to enhance product capabilities, ease of implementation, long-term flexibility, and the ability to provide improved client service.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had 4,650 employees worldwide, of which 1,919 were based in North America, 960 were based in Europe, and 1,771 were based in Asia-Pacific. 
Backlog
As of December 31, 2018, we expected to recognize $631 million in revenue in future periods from backlog on existing contracts.
