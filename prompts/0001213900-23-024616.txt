Item 1. Business
Overview



Movano Inc., dba Movano Health, a Delaware corporation, is developing a platform to deliver purpose-driven healthcare solutions to bring medical-grade, high-quality data to the forefront of consumer health devices.



The Company’s initial commercial product in development is the Evie Ring, which is a wearable designed specifically for women. The Evie Ring combines health and wellness metrics to give a full picture of one’s health, which we expect to include resting heart rate, heart rate variability (“HRV”), blood oxygen saturation (“SpO2”), respiration rate, skin temperature variability, period and ovulation tracking, menstrual symptom tracking, activity profile, including steps, active minutes and calories burned, sleep stages and duration, and mood tracking. The device will provide women and their network of caregivers with continuous health data distilled down to simple, yet meaningful, insights to help them make manageable lifestyle changes and take a more proactive approach that could mitigate the risks of chronic disease. 



Movano Health is planning to seek FDA clearance for the Evie Ring, which will make it one of the first consumer wearables that is also FDA cleared for medical use. We are on track to file our first FDA submission for the Evie Ring’s heart and SpO2 data in the second quarter of 2023 following a successful pivotal hypoxia trial during the fourth quarter of 2022. FDA clearance of these metrics would ensure confidence of the Evie Ring’s vital signs monitoring capabilities and could make the device attractive for doctors and in clinical trials for patient monitoring.


In addition to the Evie Ring, we are developing the smallest ever patented and proprietary System-on-a-Chip (“SoC”) designed specifically for blood pressure or continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) systems. We built the integrated sensor from the ground up with multiple antennas and a variety of frequencies to achieve an unprecedented level of precision in health monitoring. We are currently conducting clinical trials with the SoC and developing algorithms that, if successful, will enable us to develop wearables that can monitor glucose non-invasively and blood pressure without a cuff. Our end goal is to bring a Class II FDA-cleared device to the market that includes CGM and cuffless blood pressure monitoring capabilities. Over time, our technology could also enable the measurement and continuous monitoring of other health data.

Problem



The scale of the chronic disease health crisis is enormous, and we believe the need to address it is immediate. The United States spent over 18% of its GDP on healthcare in 2021, and according to the American Heart Association 133 million Americans are living with at least one chronic illness with 170 million expected to be by 2030.



Coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) has disproportionately affected the wellbeing of those with chronic conditions and the pandemic has created a heightened awareness about the importance of health and the high risk of complications. People have become more sensitive to the fact that managing health is not just about being physically fit but may also be a predictor of future quality of life and even lifespan. There is a need for optimized, accurate monitoring and maintenance of high-risk populations, such as those living with, or at heightened risk of, chronic conditions.



Wearable medical technology today, including CGMs and blood pressure monitors, have made it easier for those affected by chronic diseases, but many devices are still invasive, inconvenient and/or expensive.

COVID-19



COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) in 2020. The virus can spread easily from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. As of early January 2023, WHO reported that since the beginning of the pandemic there has been more than 669 million cases and nearly 6.74 million deaths caused by COVID-19 worldwide.



While some people infected with the virus experience mild respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment, others, especially those with chronic conditions, become seriously ill. Those with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, are more likely to experience severe illness, ICU admission and face a higher risk of mortality. When people with diabetes become sick, it can dramatically raise blood sugar levels. Having high blood sugar can make it more difficult to fight off illnesses like COVID-19. 



However, the risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 is likely to be lower if chronic conditions are well-managed.



The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent global healthcare crisis have highlighted the need for better monitoring of higher risk populations, such as those living with chronic conditions, to prevent continued deaths and long-term health issues.



Diabetes



Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is caused by the body’s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin, which prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. If glucose levels are not managed properly, it can lead to serious health conditions and complications, including heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function, blindness, seizures, coma and even death. According to the 2021 International Diabetes Federation Atlas, an estimated 537 million people worldwide had diabetes as of the date of the report. The number of people with diabetes (“PWDs”) worldwide is estimated to grow to 783 million by 2045, driven primarily by growth in type 2 diabetes and due to various reasons, including a change in dietary trends, an aging population and increased prevalence of the disease in younger people.



To maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range, many PWDs seek to actively monitor their blood glucose levels. The traditional method of self-monitoring of blood glucose requires lancing the fingertips, commonly referred to as finger sticks, multiple times per day to obtain a blood drop to be applied to a test strip inside a blood glucose meter. This method of monitoring glucose levels is inconvenient and can be painful. Additionally, because each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time, it provides limited information regarding trends in blood glucose levels over the course of the day, month, or year.



In contrast, CGMs are generally less painful and typically involve the insertion of a microneedle sensor into the body to measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid throughout the day and night, providing real-time data that shows trends in glucose measurements. As a result, CGMs improve glycemic control and quality of life, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple daily insulin injection therapy and help support avoidance of hypoglycemia.



However, most of today’s CGMs are still invasive, inconvenient, and expensive. Many require an implant that must be replaced after 10-14 days. This process can be uncomfortable, increases susceptibility to infections, and is expensive to manage. As a result, the vast majority of PWDs do not use a CGM. Moreover, the broader health-conscious population, including individuals with prediabetes, lacks the ability to easily monitor blood glucose levels, which can serve as a proxy for metabolic health and risk for chronic diseases. Notwithstanding the above, demand for CGMs, in general, continues to increase, with approximately three million worldwide users and industry sales estimated at more than $4.7 billion in 2021, according to published Wall Street analyst estimates.

Hypertension



Blood pressure is the pressure on the walls of arteries caused by the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system. When the force against blood vessel walls becomes too high, the heart works harder, which can cause damage to blood vessels, ultimately leading to a condition called hypertension, or high blood pressure.



According to the American Heart Association, high blood pressure affects nearly one third of the adult population worldwide. Called “the silent killer,” many people are not aware that they have high blood pressure until it is too late because there are typically no symptoms. However, hypertension can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attacks, strokes, kidney damage, amongst other problems. While there is no cure, using prescription medications, making dietary changes, increasing activity levels and maintaining awareness of blood pressure can significantly reduce the risks associated with hypertension.



Because hypertension usually has no symptoms, the only way to detect hypertension is through a blood pressure test. The test traditionally requires placement of a cuff with a pressure gauge around the upper arm that is inflated to squeeze the blood vessels. When the cuff is fully inflated, no blood flow occurs through the artery. As the cuff is deflated below the systolic pressure, the reducing pressure exerted on the artery allows blood to flow through it and sets up a detectable vibration in the arterial wall. When the cuff pressure falls below the patient’s diastolic pressure, blood flows smoothly through the artery in the usual pulses, without any vibration being set up in the wall.



In recent years, blood pressure monitoring devices have become available for personal, in-home use, so people can gain an understanding of their blood pressure in between their regular doctor visits. While there are medical device and consumer electronic companies selling blood pressure monitors today, they still have limitations and tend to be cumbersome. Some provide blood pressure estimates, rather than exact readings. Often times, blood pressure cuffs require a very specific fit based on arm size and can be very sensitive to placement on the arm, movement and body position. If not used properly, errors in measuring blood pressure can occur. Most blood pressure cuffs are not continuous, which require the user to remember to take readings at the same general time of day to avoid inconsistencies when looking at trends over time. Notwithstanding the above, demand for blood pressure monitoring devices, in general, continues to increase, with industry sales estimated at approximately $3.9 billion in 2022, according to Grand View Research.


If we can develop a device that can successfully integrate blood pressure measurements continuously and non-invasively, the device could potentially help individuals understand in real-time how food intake, sleep, activity levels, stress and more can directly impact their blood pressure and their heart health. With the ability to get actionable feedback, people should be able to be more engaged in making better decisions for their health.




Solution



As the healthcare market transitions from a practice of treating the sick to a consumer-driven market focused on preventative care and longevity, consumers’ appetite for digital health offerings is increasing and there is a significant and growing interest in digital health technology that allows users to address their unique needs and life circumstances. We believe women are particularly impacted by the state of healthcare today and are looking for tools that give them greater control over their health and confidence in their ability to self-manage and optimally prepare for potential health risks. To maximize their utility, we believe these tools should be intelligent, affordable, and fit seamlessly into every woman’s lifestyle.



Consequently, we are creating intelligent, sleek and comfortable solutions that sit at the intersection of the medical and consumer device market, providing medical-grade diagnostics in addition to lifestyle fitness monitoring. Our first product in development is a smart ring called the Evie Ring.



The Evie Ring combines health and wellness metrics to give a full picture of one’s health, which we expect will include resting heart rate, HRV, SpO2, respiration rate, skin temperature variability, period and ovulation tracking, menstrual symptom tracking, activity profile, including steps, active minutes and calories burned, sleep stages and duration, and mood tracking. This data is delivered through a mobile app which aims to simplify how data is presented, moving away from complex graphs and charts, and turning biometric data into actionable insights that will help women make manageable lifestyle changes and take a more proactive approach to mitigating the risks of chronic disease.


In future iterations of this product or another wearable device developed by Movano Health, we plan to measure glucose, blood pressure and heart rate without a needle or cuff. We will do this directly from the blood vessel by utilizing mmWave RF to probe the arteries to identify various RF properties, including RF connectivity, permittivity, and reflectivity. As these properties change, we can measure the changes in glucose and blood pressure concentrations in the blood vessels. Using our signal processing algorithms, we intend to separate the pulse pressure and glucose waveforms to jointly solve for blood pressure, pulse, and glucose. With additional sensors and an accelerometer, we expect we will also be able to estimate SpO2 measurements and measure steps and calories. We intend to provide the user real-time data, including trending, through our proprietary cloud-based network app, and enable data sharing with healthcare providers, caregivers, and family to optimize care and reinforce positive behaviors and behavioral change. By providing knowledge about glucose levels, blood pressure, heart rate, HRV, sleep, respiration, temperature, blood oxygen, steps and calories, we believe our end-to-end solution will be a valuable preventative care tool that will help users make smarter health decisions, ultimately increasing a person’s ability to self-manage chronic conditions and reducing the frequency of doctor and hospital visits.

Proprietary Technology



The Evie Ring uses a multitude of optical sensors to estimate a variety of analytics, including SpO2 and heart rate measurements, an accelerometer to measure steps and calories, as well as a battery, a charging integrated circuit, flash to store data, and Bluetooth to communicate with our mobile application.



In future products, we plan to incorporate our patented RF technology that leverages ultra-wideband multi-antenna RF with advanced signal processing and interference cancellation, machine learning and the cloud. Our RF technology is deeply rooted in military and telecom applications, and key members of our engineering team worked with the pioneers of this technology.



We intend to leverage the potential of this technology to design miniature, dynamic integrated circuits (“ICs”) and proprietary algorithms that, if small and low-powered enough, may be embeddable into a variety of devices including a wearable, standalone phone case, ring or skin patch. These devices could communicate on a minute-by-minute basis, using Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) to a smartphone or a mobile device. Our intention is to design the system to be capable of connecting to Movano Health’s cloud service, which is currently in development. Combined with our cloud analytics, we expect the technology will allow medical professionals, family members, caregivers and individuals to understand trends related to heart rate, HRV, glucose and blood pressure and make educated decisions about health, care and treatment based on that data. The goal of our development efforts is to combine machine learning with different statistical signal processing algorithms, which we believe will enable us to take advantage of multiple strains of continuous, real time Movano Health sensor data to generate advanced analytics like predictive alerts, risk profiles, and more, which are personalized for each wearer.



We believe that the main advantage of our technology under development, as compared to certain existing technologies like cameras and infrared (“IR”) sensors, will be the ability to achieve fine RF mapping in a cost-effective and small form factor. As it relates to CGM and blood pressure monitor applications, we believe that our competitive edge will be that our technology solution can be deployed on a non-invasive and cuffless basis, packaged in a wearable device, so wearers feel like people, not patients, and priced more affordably for users and payers compared to existing devices.



Our Planned Solution



Our first planned product is currently in the development stage, and we are testing the wearability and functionality of the device with employees and multiple beta partners, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies, integrated health networks and universities. For testing, we are using a device similar to the one that is depicted in the image above.




We are also testing a wrist-worn wearable prototype that contains our proprietary and patented SoC. In its current state, this prototype allows us to collect data, which we are using to generate glucose, blood pressure and heart rate estimates. The accuracy of the technology will be refined as our algorithms are improved and as we test larger cross sections of people in our external studies. We are currently preparing for clinical trials using the SoC and our smallest wrist-worn prototype to date.

We have conducted preliminary tests thus far to diversify the data we are collecting, enabling us to better optimize our system. Our preliminary blood pressure testing took place in 2020 over a three-month period during which we collected nearly a hundred hours of data on six internal subjects. Data collections with our prototype were compared to a traditional blood pressure monitor before each test. Our preliminary glucose testing took place in 2020 over a four to five month time period during which we collected several hundreds of hours of data on three internal test subjects. Data collections with our prototype were compared to fingerstick data every five minutes over the course of an hour.



In June 2021, we received approval from an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) to conduct blood pressure studies on up to 200 participants in our laboratory. In our first study, we used our non-invasive, iPhone-sized prototype device to collect pulse pressure waveform data from 45 external participants. This study marked a significant milestone, confirming our ability to quickly, seamlessly, and efficiently enroll and test subjects and collect meaningful data at the laboratory inside our corporate offices.



In December 2021, we completed our third and largest blood pressure clinical trial, which was conducted on 110 participants in our laboratory. During the study, participants wore our adjustable full finger ring prototype and our wrist-worn wearable prototype along with a hospital-grade FDA-cleared vital signs monitor as the control. Our devices collected pulse pressure waveform data, which will be compared to data from the control device in order to further our signal processing and algorithms.



In February 2022, we completed our second IRB-approved glucose pilot study, which was conducted on ten participants with type 1 diabetes of varying gender, age, ethnicity and weight in conjunction with an independent Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified clinical lab. During each four-hour session, participants wore our wrist-worn wearable prototype and either a FDA cleared finger stick glucose tester, a subject’s existing CGM device, and/or a vital sign monitoring device. We expect the data collected in the study will ultimately allow us to further refine the algorithms we use to calculate glucose values and vital sign measurements and will also help guide us as to what specific follow-on studies will be done in support of future FDA clearances.



In 2021, we completed the tapeout of our single-chip solution with our fabrication partner, Global Foundries. The tapeout of the SoC is a major milestone for us as we were able to shrink our proprietary multi-chip architecture into a singular integrated circuit. With one compact sensor, we have the flexibility to design innovative, small form factors that will be key to developing competitive commercial products in the future. In 2022, we successfully validated the SoC and are currently integrating the SoC into a new prototype system, which will be closer in size and shape to our final product, and enable the Company to conduct longer, more complex blood pressure and glucose studies, which are being planned for 2023.



To date, we have completed two clinical trials with the Evie Ring. Following a successful pilot hypoxia study in July 2022, which compared the accuracy of our heart rate and SpO2 data to reference devices, we completed a pivotal hypoxia study in October 2022 with the Evie Ring. During the pilot and pivotal studies, our solution achieved a margin of error well below the FDA’s 3.5% requirement for SpO2, and the ring also estimated heart rate with accuracy commensurate with the FDA’s standards. Based on the positive results of these studies, we plan to file for FDA clearance on these metrics by mid-2023. If clearance is received, the Evie Ring would be deemed a medical device. This unique competitive advantage is not only a key pillar in building brand trust and loyalty but will also redefine the expectations of wearable devices. 



Having our product cleared as a medical device would also open a host of incremental opportunities for us beyond what you see in the market today. Currently, many wearable devices sell-in to companies for employee benefits or partner with payors. As an FDA-cleared medical device, the Evie Ring may be used with pharmaceutical companies for post-market surveillance or with medical device companies looking to determine the efficacy of their offering. 



We expect the direct-to-consumer launch of the Evie Ring to take place in the summer of 2023 prior to any FDA decision regarding medical device clearance. We have hired a world class go-to-market leadership team and have been working with leading app development partners to build on the foundational elements already in place to create a unique and valuable user experience. Further, we have engaged leading marketing, branding, website development and consumer research partners, to ensure the brand is engaging and relevant to the target audience.


To prepare for the consumer launch of the Evie Ring, we are conducting initial beta test programs to evaluate the fit and functionality of the ring with four strategic partners, including Stanford University’s Applied Sports Science Department, Novant Health, a not-for-profit integrated system of medical centers with more than 1,800 physicians providing care through six million annual patient visits at nearly 800 locations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, a major global pharmaceutical company and a leading patient-focused medical device company.



We are also preparing for a second beta program to evaluate the end to end Evie Ring experience with a new slate of partners, among which are a global athletic apparel company and two additional leading global medical device companies. The beta programs are expected to continue through mid-2023.

Our current primary goals are to successfully conduct beta programs and optimize the ring based on feedback from the programs in order to prepare for the commercialization of our first product. We also plan to begin testing of our single chip solution in more extensive clinical trials and are working with an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) to prepare for product manufacturing of the Evie Ring.



We have not launched a first commercial product and do not have a history of revenue or earnings or of product development or manufacturing. As described further below under “Regulation” and “Strategy”, before we can commercialize our planned solution, we will need to determine our commercialization strategy.



Intellectual Property



We are committed to developing and protecting our intellectual property and, where appropriate, filing patent applications to protect our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and other agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. We require our officers, employees and consultants to enter into standard agreements containing provisions requiring confidentiality of proprietary information and assignment to us of all inventions made during the course of their employment or consulting relationship. We also enter into nondisclosure agreements with our commercial counterparties and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information.



As of December 31, 2022, we own, jointly own, or have exclusive rights to 16 issued and in-force patents (that cover one or more of our products or product candidates for method, system and device development) that expire at various times between November 12, 2039 and December 18, 2039. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2022, we own, jointly own, or have exclusive rights to 38 pending U.S. patent applications, 4 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) International patent application.



While we have not registered any of the copyrights in our software code, our software code, once written, would be protected by applicable U.S. copyright law.



Regulation



FDA Regulation



While the first iteration of the Evie Ring is expected to be a general wellness device and therefore not require FDA premarket clearance, over time we plan to execute accuracy studies to gain FDA clearances on its vital signs monitoring capabilities including heart rate, SpO2 and respiration rate. In addition, we are currently conducting clinical trials with our proprietary and noninvasive RF-enabled technology and developing algorithms to enable us to add non-invasive CGM and cuffless blood pressure monitoring to our technology platform. Our end goal is to bring a Class II FDA-cleared device to the market, which may include additional form factors, and that includes CGM and cuffless blood pressure monitoring capabilities.



Before and after approval or clearance in the U.S., these subsequent iterations of our planned solution will be subject to extensive regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products. There may be certain commercial applications for our technology that require less regulatory scrutiny than described below.



FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices



In the U.S., medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:




● | Class I: general controls, such as labeling, establishment registration, device listing, and, for some devices, adherence to quality system regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





7








● | Class II: the general controls plus certain special controls, FDA clearance via a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries and post-market surveillance and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III: general and special controls and approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our end goal for our planned solution in development is to bring to market a product that will be classified as a Class II medical device and thus require FDA clearance prior to marketing by means of a 510(k) clearance rather than a PMA application.



To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, a “predicate device,” has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as the predicate device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information and the results of performance testing. In this case, the 510(k) submission will likely also include data from human clinical studies demonstrating performance and other parameters. Marketing may commence only when FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. The typical duration to receive a 510(k) clearance is approximately six to twelve months from the date of the initial 510(k) submission, although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be longer.


In some instances, the 510(k) pathway for product marketing may be used with only proof of substantial equivalence in technology for a given indication with a predicate device. In other instances, FDA may require additional clinical work to prove efficacy in addition to technological equivalence and basic safety. Whether clinical data is provided or not, FDA may decide to reject the substantial equivalence argument we present. If that happens, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which may determine that the new device is of low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately regulated as a Class I or II device. If a de novo request is granted, the device may be legally marketed, and a new classification is established. If the device is classified as Class II, the device may serve as a predicate for future 510(k) submissions. If the device is not reclassified through de novo review, then it must go through the standard PMA process for Class III devices.




After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, a PMA.


A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data. Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing, and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with quality system regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation, and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing, testing, and storage of medical devices. If FDA determines the application or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians, may be convened to review the application and recommend to FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision. While FDA often follows the panel’s recommendation, there have been instances in which FDA has not. FDA must find the information to be satisfactory to approve the PMA. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies after approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling, or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. The typical duration to receive PMA approval is approximately two years from the date of submission of the initial PMA application, although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be longer.





8







Clinical Trials of Medical Devices



One or more clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes necessary to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an investigational device exemption application to FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. If an institutional review board determines that a device study does not present a significant risk, an investigational device exemption submission to FDA is not required. An investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Except for studies involving certain banned devices, the investigational device exemption will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by FDA unless FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board has approved the study.



During the study, the sponsor must comply with FDA’s investigational device exemption requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. The sponsor, FDA, or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.



Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices



After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:




● | FDA quality systems regulation, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Manufacturing Practices Requirements



Manufacturers of most medical devices are required to comply with the good manufacturing practices set forth in the quality system regulation promulgated under Section 520 of the FD&C Act. Current good manufacturing practices regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facility for an approved product must be registered with FDA and meet current good manufacturing practices requirements to the satisfaction of FDA pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before the facility can be used. Manufacturers, including third party contract manufacturers, are also subject to periodic inspections by FDA and other authorities to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.




9







Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) Regulations



Our RF-based technology involves the transmission of RF energy, and as such, will be subject to regulation by the FCC, including the FCC’s equipment authorization regulations and its regulations governing human exposure to RF energy. In particular, we expect the planned solution to be regulated under Part 18 of the FCC’s rules governing industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment, and to be classified as consumer ISM equipment under that rule part. Based on the expected frequency and power of operation, we expect that the product will comply with the Part 18 technical specifications for these type of devices, which we will be required to verify under FCC equipment authorization procedures. We also expect, based on the device’s frequency and power of operation, that the product will comply with the FCC’s requirements governing human exposure to RF energy.
Environmental.



The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the year ended December 31, 2022, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Strategy



We are a newly public emerging growth company without a history of operations or revenue, and therefore intend to explore alternative business strategies, including:




● | selling directly to consumers and enterprise customers through retail channels and through our website or other distribution channels;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | partnering with OEMs, and value-added resellers (“VARs”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | partnering with industry partners to incorporate our technology into new and existing devices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Selling our products directly to consumers would not depend on locating a suitable OEM or VAR but would require us to complete the development and manufacture of our planned solution and commercialize the product on our own without the assistance a suitable OEM or VAR could provide. We may use distributors to help distribute our product to consumers, and the costs of working with such distributors, including without limitation the compensation to such distributors and the administrative and other costs of working with such distributors, would reduce our profit margin.



We expect that partnering with OEMs and VARs may accelerate product acceptance into our target market and allow us to take advantage of the sales and marketing and distribution infrastructure of those OEMs or VARs. In particular, we believe that a maker of ICs or a manufacturer of wearables would be an ideal strategic partner for the Company.



One of the challenges of IC development is ensuring the ability to source quality ICs with enough volume and competitive pricing. In order to strengthen our supply chain and prepare for the future, we formed a strategic partnership with a leading specialty foundry, for manufacturing and supplying our ICs.



Competition



The technology industry, generally, and the general wellness, continuous glucose and blood pressure monitoring markets, in particular, are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities by industry participants. To compete successfully, we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well-established alternative solutions, products, and technologies, as well as newer ones, and convince consumers and enterprises of the advantages of our products and technologies.



With respect to a potential solution that is targeted at the general wellness market, we would face direct and indirect competition from a number of competitors who have developed and commercialized similar products. These competitors include Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, WHOOP and Oura Health. Many of such potential competitors enjoy significantly greater name recognition and have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing than we have.



With respect to our planned CGM solution, we will face direct and indirect competition from a number of competitors who have developed or are developing products for continuous monitoring of glucose levels. These competitors include DexCom, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc, Roche Diagnostics, LifeScan, Inc., Ascensia Diabetes Care Holdings AG, Senseonics Holdings, Inc., Integrity Applications, Inc., Nemaura Medical, Biolinq Inc., and Profusa, Inc. Our planned solution will also compete with traditional glucometers, which remain an inexpensive alternative. Many of the companies we will compete with enjoy significantly greater name recognition and have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and sales and marketing of approved products than we have.

We will also face direct and indirect competition from a number of competitors who have developed or are developing products that monitor blood pressure. These competitors include OMRON Corporation, Welch Allyn, A&D Medical, American Diagnostic Corporation, GE Healthcare, Masimo Corporation, Philips, SunTech Medical Inc., Aktiia, Biobeat and Blumio. Many of the companies we will compete with enjoy significantly greater name recognition and have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and sales and marketing of approved products than we have.


Mergers and acquisitions in the medical device, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Other small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. There are also several academic and other institutions involved in various phases of technology development regarding blood glucose monitoring devices.




We believe the ability to deploy our technology on a non-invasive basis, packaged in a wearable that is painless, cuffless, simple, smart and competitively priced, will provide us with a competitive advantage. We cannot however assure you that we will be able to compete successfully.



Employees and Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2022, we had 34 employees, all of whom are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.


Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
