Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an innovative oncology company focused on the discovery and development of selective cancer therapies to treat patients across a range of solid tumors with significant unmet medical needs. We are rethinking drug development by seeking innovative, selective cancer therapies that can be matched to a patient’s unique tumor characteristics.
Our lead product candidate, EO-3021 (also known as SYSA1801 or CPO102), is an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) designed to target Claudin 18.2, a clinically validated molecular target, which can selectively deliver a cytotoxic payload directly to cancer cells expressing Claudin 18.2. We currently retain worldwide development and commercialization rights for EO-3021 outside Greater China (the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). Our licensor and partner, CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited (collectively with its affiliates, “CSPC”), is actively recruiting patients in its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SYSA1801 (EO-3021) in China.
We are working to rapidly advance EO-3021 into the clinic in the United States and other territories outside Greater China across a range of solid tumor indications. We expect to present preclinical proof-of-concept data of EO-3021 at a major medical conference in the first half of 2023 and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of EO-3021 in the United States in the second half of 2023. An Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for EO-3021 has been cleared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). EO-3021 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of gastric cancer (including cancer of gastroesophageal junction) in November 2020 and for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in May 2021.
In January 2023, we announced that we have paused further investment in the clinical development of seribantumab, an anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody for solid tumors driven by neuregulin-1, or NRG1 fusions, a type of genomic alteration and oncogenic driver in solid tumors. As a result, further enrollment in the Phase 2 CRESTONE study of seribantumab has been paused. Long-term follow-up of all patients who have been treated with seribantumab to date remains ongoing. We intend to pursue further clinical development of seribantumab only in collaboration with a partner. We plan to present additional interim clinical data from our Phase 2 CRESTONE clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of seribantumab in advanced solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion in the first half of 2023.
We are exploring opportunities through new or existing partnerships and business development opportunities to expand our novel oncology pipeline. This includes leveraging our value-driving partnerships with Caris Life Sciences (“Caris”) and others.
We are managed by a team with significant experience and track records for clinical and commercial execution in the oncology space and backed by a group of renowned scientific advisors and partners that bring diagnostic, clinical and operational expertise to help optimize execution. 
Our strategy
Our goal is to deliver safe and effective selective cancer therapies for patient populations with significant unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Rapidly advance our lead product candidate, EO-3021, an ADC targeting Claudin 18.2, through clinical development. Claudin 18.2 is a clinically validated oncology target expressed in several solid tumor types, including many gastrointestinal cancers, which we believe represents a significant market opportunity. There are currently no approved therapies targeting Claudin 18.2. SYSA1801 (EO-3021) is currently being assessed in a Phase 1 clinical trial in China by CSPC. We expect to present preclinical proof-of-concept data of EO-3021 at a major medical conference in the first half of 2023 and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of EO-3021 in the United States in the second half of 2023.

● | Expand our pipeline of selective cancer drug candidates and targets. We intend to continue expanding our pipeline, including by leveraging our partnerships and our own internal expertise and capabilities, to potentially accelerate the identification of additional actionable selective cancer targets. We then expect to in-license, acquire or discover assets with therapeutic potential against those identified selective cancer targets. Through our collaboration with Caris, we continually assess oncogenic fusions and driver mutations identified in Caris’s molecular and clinical database to identify potential targets and then elect to initiate a novel drug discovery program for those targets or evaluate existing therapeutics for potential in-licensing or product acquisition.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evaluate strategic opportunities to potentially accelerate development timelines and enhance the commercial potential of our product candidates globally. We intend to build an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a broad portfolio of selective cancer therapies to treat patients across a range of solid tumors with significant unmet medical needs. We plan to commercialize our product candidates in key markets, either alone or with strategic partners, and maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs.

Our Lead Product Candidate: EO-3021
EO-3021 is an ADC designed to target Claudin 18.2, a clinically validated molecular target, which can selectively deliver a cytotoxic payload directly to cancer cells expressing Claudin 18.2. Claudin 18.2 is expressed across several solid tumor types, including many gastrointestinal cancers such as gastric, gastroesophageal junction and pancreatic cancer, which we believe represents a significant market opportunity. Claudin 18.2 is also expressed in ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and other solid tumors. There are currently no approved therapies targeting Claudin 18.2, and we believe EO-3021 could potentially address a high unmet medical need and play a transformative role across several solid tumor types.
In July 2022, we licensed the worldwide exclusive right, outside of Greater China, from CSPC to develop and commercialize products containing EO-3021 for the treatment of cancer. CSPC is actively recruiting patients in its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SYSA1801 (EO-3021) in China. An IND for EO-3021 has been cleared with the FDA. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of EO-3021 in the United States in the second half of 2023.
Mechanism of action
Claudin 18.2 is a unique and highly selective target that is part of a family of tight junction membrane proteins. Expression of Claudin 18.2 in normal tissues is restricted to the gastric mucosa and generally does not overlap with HER2 overexpression or PD-L1 expression. Claudin18.2 is expressed in several types of cancers, including gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, ovarian and lung cancer. EO-3021 is an anti-Claudin 18.2 ADC that binds to Claudin 18.2 on the cell surface and is internalized, upon which the linker is cleaved in the lysosome to release the monomethyl auristatin E (“MMAE”) payload, a potent anti-mitotic agent. This results in microtubule disruption, inhibiting cell division and promoting cancer cell death via apoptosis. MMAE has been clinically validated as an effective anti-tumor payload and is the cytotoxic component of several FDA-approved ADCs.
The structure of Claudin 18.2 is shown in Figure 1 below, and the mechanism of action of EO-3021 is shown in Figure 2 below:

Figure 1
Structure of Claudin 18.2. Claudin 18.2 is a tight junction membrane protein with four transmembrane structural domains (TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM4), two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ELC2) and the NH2 and COOH ends (N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively) located intracellularly.
Figure 2
Mechanism of Action of EO-3021. EO-3021 is an ADC consisting of a monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) directed against Claudin 18.2, a linker and an MMAE payload (left). The mAb binds to Claudin 18.2, and this initiates internalization of the ADC complex. Lysosomal cleavage of the linker releases MMAE into the tumor cell, which results in microtubule disruption, inhibiting cell division and promoting cancer cell death via apoptosis (right).

Global opportunity
There is significant global opportunity for the treatment of patients with tumors expressing Claudin 18.2. Claudin 18.2 is expressed in several cancers with significant unmet needs, including gastric, esophageal, pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer, among others, with expression being highest in gastric/gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) and pancreatic tumors. Our license to develop and commercialize EO-3021 is for all global territories outside Greater China.
Incidence information and Claudin 18.2 expression rates for certain cancers with significant unmet needs are shown below. The Claudin 18.2 expression rates are based on studies of incidence rates as published in 2008 by Sahin, et al. in Clinical Cancer Research, in 2011 by Tanaka, et al. in the Journal of Histochemistry & Cytochemistry and in 2014 by Micke, et al. in the International Journal of Cancer.

​
Clinical validation of the target and potential for broader target population
Based on clinical data reported for other therapeutic agents targeting Claudin 18.2 in various phases of clinical development, including mAb and CAR T-cell approaches, we believe this target has been clinically validated. Whereas both mAb and CAR T-cell anti-Claudin 18.2 approaches have required a substantial portion of tumor cells with moderate-to-high expression of Claudin 18.2 for anti-tumor activity, we believe an ADC approach could potentially target tumors with any expression of Claudin 18.2, including tumors with low levels of expression. Therefore, EO-3021 could potentially capture a broader patient population and greater commercial opportunity.
Clinical development plan
An IND for EO-3021 has been cleared with the FDA. We are planning a Phase I dose escalation and expansion trial with EO-3021 in patients with solid tumors likely to express Claudin 18.2. The trial is expected to begin enrolling patients in the United States in the second half of 2023.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
We expect to purchase any clinical or commercial supply of EO-3021 from CSPC. Until we have completed the first Phase 2 clinical trial for EO-3021 in the United States, CSPC will supply EO-3021 for clinical investigation purposes in the United States as we request, but only to the extent necessary to conduct such clinical trial, at no cost to us.

We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacturing of any companion or complementary diagnostics we may develop.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our team, and our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
We compete directly with companies that focus on oncology and companies dedicating their resources to cancer therapies. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology, we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available and new therapeutic candidates are clinically developed or approved therapies are explored for new indications. Any candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion or complementary diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, and are more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or could otherwise make our development more complicated. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and patient convenience. Even if our product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then.
There are a number of biological and biotechnology companies that currently are pursuing the development of therapies for patients with cancers with significant unmet needs. In particular, we expect that our current lead product candidate, EO-3021, will compete against other ADCs that are in development for targeting Claudin 18.2, including those of Antengene Corporation (ATG-022), Keymed Biosciences (CMG 901), KLUS Pharma Inc. (SKB315), RemeGen (RC118), SOTIO Biotech (SOT102), TORL Biotherapeutics, LLC (TORL-2-307-ADC) and Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (now owned by Bristol Myers Squibb) (LM-302). We may face further competition from companies pursuing the development of product candidates that target Claudin 18.2 through other modalities, including Astellas Pharma Inc., Beijing Mabworks Biotech Co., Ltd., CARsgen Therapeutics Holdings Limited, Flame Biosciences, Jiangsu Aosaikang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Legend Biotech Corporation, NovaRock Biotherapeutics Limited, Transcenta Holding Limited, Zai Lab Limited, and others. Development efforts and clinical results of these other product candidates may be unsuccessful, which could result in a negative perception of product candidates targeting Claudin 18.2 in general, and negatively impact the regulatory approval process of EO-3021.

Licensing, collaboration and asset purchase agreements
CSPC License Agreement
In July 2022, we entered into a license agreement (the “CSPC License Agreement”) with CSPC Megalith Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited, pursuant to which CSPC granted to us a worldwide exclusive right and license (outside of Greater China) under certain patents identified in the CSPC License Agreement (the “Licensed Patents”) and know-how to develop and commercialize products containing EO-3021 (“Licensed Products”) in the treatment of cancer.
Pursuant to the terms of the CSPC License Agreement, we paid to CSPC a one-time, upfront payment of $27.0 million. CSPC will also be eligible to receive up to $148.0 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $1.0 billion in potential commercial milestone payments plus royalties on net sales. During the term of the CSPC License Agreement, we are also required to pay to CSPC (i) royalties ranging from mid-single digits through low double digits on net sales of each Licensed Product and (ii) a percentage of non-royalty sublicense income received by us, up to an aggregate of $50.0 million.
We will purchase Licensed Products for any clinical or commercial supply from CSPC under the terms of a supply agreement. Until we have completed the first Phase 2 clinical trial for the first Licensed Product in the United States, CSPC shall supply EO-3021 for clinical purposes as we request, but only to the extent necessary to conduct such clinical trial, at no cost to us.
The CSPC License Agreement will expire automatically upon the expiration of the last royalty term of the last Licensed Product, with each royalty term expiring on a country-by-country basis upon the later of: (i) the expiration or abandonment of the last-to-expire Licensed Patent covering a Licensed Product; (ii) 10 years after the date of first commercial sale in the applicable country; and (iii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the Licensed Product in the applicable country.
​
The CSPC License Agreement may be terminated by us for any reason upon 180 days prior written notice to CSPC. CSPC may terminate the CSPC License Agreement if we or any sublicensee commences an action challenging the Licensed Patents or following the occurrence of certain change of control transactions. Either party may terminate the CSPC License Agreement (i) for an uncured material breach of the CSPC License Agreement by the other party or (ii) if, at any time, the other party undergoes certain bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution proceedings.
Caris Agreement
In June 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Caris (the “Caris Agreement”). Under the terms of the Caris Agreement, Caris will identify targets for the collaboration and provide those targets to us at regular intervals for review and approval. Once a target is selected by the collaboration’s joint steering committee, the collaboration will retain access to the selected targets.
The financial terms surrounding development and commercialization of each product candidate identified for the collaboration and included in the Caris Agreement vary based on the level of participation elected by each party in the development and commercialization efforts following identification of a target. There are no upfront or milestone payments or royalties due to either party under the collaboration. With respect to proceeds from any potential commercial transaction related to a product resulting from the collaboration, Caris will be entitled to a tiered initial percentage ranging from the mid-single digits to low teens based on the product candidate’s potential peak sales revenue with the remaining proceeds allocated based on each party’s pro-rata share of expenses incurred in development of the product. In the case of an out-licensing transaction of an asset instead of a sale, Caris and we will split all consideration received in the transaction in a similar manner. The Caris Agreement provides flexibility for we and Caris to jointly develop and commercialize, or for either we or Caris to incur development and commercialization expenses. The ultimate percentage of proceeds payable to us and Caris will depend on the level of development and commercialization participation elected by each party.

10



We will own the intellectual property rights to the therapeutics developed under the collaboration, and Caris will own the intellectual property rights to the diagnostics developed under the collaboration.
Either party may terminate the Caris Agreement for uncured material breach by the other party or in the case of the other party’s insolvency. The term of the Caris Agreement is three years, automatically renewing for one-year terms. Either party may terminate the agreement at the end of a term by written notice to the other, subject to the continuation of exclusivity with respect to any target selected by the joint steering committee, so long as commercially reasonable efforts are used to discover, identify, develop and/or commercialize a therapeutic related to such target.
Previous Sponsor Asset Purchase Agreement
In May 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “previous sponsor”), pursuant to which we acquired the previous sponsor’s anti-HER3 antibody programs (the “Acquired Product Candidates”), including seribantumab. Upon closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement in July 2019, we paid the previous sponsor an upfront cash payment of $3.5 million. In addition to the foregoing payment, we may become obligated to pay the previous sponsor up to $54.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory approval and commercial-based milestone payments, consisting of:

● | $3.0 million for achievement of the primary endpoint in the first registrational clinical trial of any Acquired Product Candidate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | up to $16.5 million in total payments for the achievement of various regulatory approval and reimbursement-based milestones in the United States, Europe and Japan; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | up to $35.0 million in total payments for achieving various cumulative worldwide net sales targets between $100.0 million and $300.0 million for the Acquired Product Candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dyax Collaboration Agreement
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with the previous sponsor, we (i) assumed all of the previous sponsor’s obligations and rights under the amended and restated collaboration agreement (the “Dyax Collaboration Agreement”), between the previous sponsor and Dyax Corp. (“Dyax”), which was entered into in January 2007, including an exclusive, worldwide product license to clinically develop or commercialize seribantumab and (ii) agreed to be bound to the terms of a sublicense agreement between the previous sponsor and Dyax entered into in June 2008. Under the Dyax Collaboration Agreement, Dyax used its proprietary phage display technology to identify antibodies that bind to targets of interest to us as therapeutics or diagnostics. Seribantumab was identified through the Dyax Collaboration Agreement. In January 2016, Dyax was acquired by Shire plc, which was subsequently acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited in January 2019.
We may be required to make additional maximum aggregate development and regulatory milestone payments of up to approximately $9.3 million for seribantumab. In addition, Dyax is entitled to tiered mid single digit royalties based on net sales of seribantumab. Our obligation to pay royalties to Dyax continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of seribantumab in such country and the expiration of the patent rights covering the product in such country. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the antibodies for which we obtain a commercial license.
The Dyax Collaboration Agreement will remain in effect, unless terminated earlier, for so long as we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees continue to develop or commercialize products that remain royalty-bearing under the Dyax Collaboration Agreement. Either party may terminate the Dyax Collaboration Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. We also may terminate the Dyax Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice.

11



Ligand Commercial License Agreement
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with the previous sponsor, we purchased from the previous sponsor all of the right, title and interest in and to the commercial license agreement between the previous sponsor and Selexis SA (“Selexis”), for non-exclusive rights to technology for use in the manufacture of certain biologic products. Under this agreement, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to €0.9 million, per licensed product, and pay royalties of less than one percent on net sales of product, which royalty payments expire in 2026. The obligation to pay royalties with respect to each product sold in a country continues until the expiration of the patent rights covering the product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. We also have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days’ prior written notice. In November of 2021, this agreement was assigned from Selexis to Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (“Ligand”).
Financing agreements
K2HV Loan and Security Agreement
In July 2022, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with K2 HealthVentures LLC (together with its affiliates, “K2HV”, and together with any other lender from time to time party thereto, the “Lenders”), as administrative agent for the Lenders, and Ankura Trust Company, LLC, as collateral agent for the Lenders. The Loan Agreement provides up to $50.0 million principal in term loans (the “Term Loan”) consisting of a first tranche of $30.0 million funded at closing and a subsequent second tranche of up to $20.0 million upon our request before March 1, 2025, subject to review by the Lenders of certain information from us and discretionary approval by the Lenders. In connection with entering into the Loan Agreement, we also issued to K2HV a warrant to purchase shares of common stock.
The Term Loan will mature on August 1, 2026, with interest only payments for 30 months, and thereafter interest and principal payments for the remaining 18 months. It bears a variable interest rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.95% and (ii) the sum of (A) the prime rate last quoted in The Wall Street Journal (or a comparable replacement rate, as determined by the Lenders, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate) and (B) 3.20%. Upon the final payment under the Loan Agreement, the Lenders are entitled to an end of term charge equal to 6.45% of the aggregate original principal amount of the term loans made pursuant to the Loan Agreement.
We may prepay, at its option, all, but not less than all, of the outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the principal balance being prepaid of the term loans, subject to a prepayment premium as follows: 3% of the Loan amounts prepaid if such prepayment occurs in the first year after funding; 2% if such prepayment occurs in the second year after funding; 1% if such prepayment occurs in the third year after funding; and 0% thereafter. 
The Lenders may elect at any time following the closing and prior to the full repayment of the term loans to convert any portion of the principal amount of the term loans then outstanding, up to an aggregate of $3.25 million in principal amount, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $2.6493, subject to customary 19.99% Nasdaq beneficial ownership limitations. We also granted registration rights to the Lenders with respect to shares received upon such conversion.
Further, the Lenders may elect to invest up to $5.0 million in our future equity financings, provided such investment is limited to no more than 10% of the total amount raised in such equity financing. 
The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, make changes to our business, management, ownership or business locations, merge or consolidate, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or other distributions or repurchase equity, make investments, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Loan Agreement also contains covenants requiring that we maintain cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of at least $25.0 million so long as our total market capitalization is less than $250.0 million.

12



As security for its obligations under the Loan Agreement, the Company granted the Lenders a first priority security interest on substantially all of the Company’s assets (other than intellectual property), subject to certain exceptions.
Cowen Sales Agreement
In July 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), under which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $50.0 million. We have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement.
Intellectual property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the compositions of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, and other inventions that are important to our business.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability and our licensors’ ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business, to defend and enforce our patents, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of selective cancer therapy.
Our wholly owned patent portfolio includes a patent family with claims directed to antibodies and related compositions covering seribantumab, as well as methods of treating cancer using such antibodies and compositions. The family contains three U.S. patents directed to seribantumab which expire in February 2028 and a fourth U.S. patent which expires in October 2029 (including 614 days of Patent Term Adjustment), subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The family also contains a pending U.S. application, which if issued, would expire in February 2028, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
In addition, the above-discussed patent family includes granted patents in China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, and Japan with claims directed to compositions of matter covering seribantumab and related methods of therapy. These patents expire in February 2028, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
Our patent portfolio further includes an additional early-stage, published patent family specifically covering the use of seribantumab to treat patients harboring an NRG1 fusion according to our CRESTONE clinical trial dosing regimen. Any patents issuing from this family would expire in March 2042, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted due to any failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for issuing a patent.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the original expiration of the patent. The protection provided by a patent varies from country to country, and is dependent on the type of patent granted, the scope of the patent claims, and the legal remedies available in a given country. 
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and 

13



development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, biological products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, with the exception that the section of the FDC Act that governs the approval of drugs via new drug applications (“NDAs”), does not apply to the approval of biologics. In contrast, biologics are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), via a biologics license application (“BLA”). However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Biological product development for a new product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Imposition of a clinical hold may be full or partial. The study protocol and 

14



informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into patients, the product is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with drug exposure, and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the biologic for a particular indication, determine optimal dose and regimen, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the biologic. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient when either (1) the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) the single trial is supported by other confirmatory evidence. Approval on the basis of a single trial may be subject to a requirement for additional post-approval studies.
These phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the anti-tumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s). Typically, during the development of oncology therapies, all subjects enrolled in Phase 1 clinical trials are disease-affected patients and, as a result, considerably more information on clinical activity may be collected during such trials than during Phase 1 clinical trials for non-oncology therapies.
In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational biologic in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug or biologic.
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Under an approved BLA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees typically increase annually. A BLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the BLA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the FDA’s determination that it is adequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. A BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the biologic has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the BLA submission.

15



The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, as well as biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the BLA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective, or the biologic is safe, pure, potent, and effective, in the respective claimed indication.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a product’s safe use (“ETASU”). An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA, or supplement to an approved BLA, before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing original BLAs.
Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologic products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.
Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of applications for approval of products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product 

16



candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
Accelerated Approval
Accelerated approval may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in most cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”) was recently enacted, which included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or termination of the study. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant orphan drug designation to products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a rare disease for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug 

17



exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the BLA application fee.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologic products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), BLAs, or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any biological product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the “BPCA”), provides a six-month extension of any non-patent exclusivity for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.

18



Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologics manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Biosimilars
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the “BPCIA”), creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a previously approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was approved in 2021. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose some hurdles to biosimilar product implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, or BLA approval, of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion and Complementary Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, before or at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that 

19



a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a new therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.
The FDA has also introduced the concept of a complementary diagnostic, which the FDA defines as a test that is not required but which provides significant information about the use of a drug. A complementary test can help guide treatment strategy and identify which patients are likely to derive the greatest benefit from therapy, and if approved by the FDA information regarding the IVD will be included in the therapeutic product labeling.
Approval or clearance of the companion or complementary diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion or complementary diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our products will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by CDER and the FDA’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. We may partner with a diagnostic provider to develop a companion or complementary diagnostic for certain of our product candidates. Review and approval of a companion or complementary diagnostic is typically done in parallel with development of the therapeutic product. However, it is possible that the FDA may permit approval of the companion or complementary diagnostic as a post-marketing commitment following a potential regulatory approval.
Under the FDC Act, in vitro diagnostics, including companion or complementary diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA approval”). The vast majority of companion and complementary diagnostics require PMA approval.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, additional testing and/or restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be 

20



withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and the processes of the specification developer and repackager/relabeler (if different from the manufacturer) and initial importer (if manufactured outside of the United States), are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. 
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency, privacy and cybersecurity laws and other healthcare laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “ACA”), amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

21



In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the collection, processing, storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of protected health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA or HITECH.
Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
Analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Further, certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, we may also be subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable state, federal, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way

healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. 
On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. These initiatives recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) in August 2022, which will, among other things, allow HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in January 2023 for Medicare Part B and October 2022 for Medicare Part D, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, market acceptance of our drug products is dependent on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities (including in connection with government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Coverage decisions may not favor new drug products when more established or lower-cost therapeutic alternatives are already available. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our drug products.
Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly which will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained. It is difficult to predict at this time what government authorities and third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for our drug products. Additionally, we may develop, either by ourselves or with collaborators, companion or complementary diagnostic tests for our product candidates for certain indications. We, or our collaborators, if any, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures. In particular, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular reference listed drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a reference listed drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Employees and human capital resources
As of March 3, 2023, we had 33 full-time employees. Of these employees, six held M.D. and/or Ph.D. degrees, and six were engaged in research, development and technical operations. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors and consultants to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our incentive share plan is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of incentive share-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
Facilities
We are a remote-first company, meaning that substantially all of our employees work remotely. As a result of this strategy, we do not maintain a corporate headquarters or lease any corporate facilities. We believe that our virtual arrangements are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that suitable space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, should it be needed.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.
