Business Strategy
Our stated mission is “Guiding people to a lifetime of financial success.” We have established an accompanying corporate vision, “To be a company where our associates are proud, our customers find easy to navigate, our investors value and our communities flourish.” These tenets are fundamental to our business strategies and operations.
 1

Our business strategy is to generate shareholder returns by providing comprehensive financial services primarily to privately-held businesses, their owner families, and other success-minded individuals. The Company has one segment for purposes of its financial reporting.
The Company offers a broad range of business and personal banking services, including wealth management services. Lending services include commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, real estate construction and development, residential real estate, and consumer loans. A wide variety of deposit products and a complete suite of treasury management and international trade services complement our lending capabilities. Tax credit brokerage activities consist of the acquisition of Federal and State tax credits and the sale of these tax credits to clients. Enterprise Trust, a division of the Bank (“Enterprise Trust” or “Trust”), provides financial planning, estate planning, investment management, and trust services to businesses, individuals, institutions, retirement plans, and non-profit organizations.
Key components of our strategy include a focused and relationship-oriented distribution and sales approach, with an emphasis on growing fee income and niche businesses, while maintaining prudent credit and interest rate risk management, appropriate supporting technology, and controlled expense growth. 
Building long-term client relationships - Our growth strategy is first and foremost client relationship driven. We continuously seek to add clients who fit our target market of businesses, business owners, professionals, and associated relationships. Those relationships are maintained, cultivated, and expanded over time by trained, experienced banking officers and other professionals. We fund loan growth primarily with core deposits from our business and professional clients in addition to consumers in our branch market areas. This is supplemented by borrowing or other deposit sources, including advances from Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the “FHLB”), and brokered certificates of deposits. 
Specialized lending and product niches - We have focused our lending activities in specialty markets where we believe our expertise and experience as a commercial lender provides advantages over other competitors. In addition, we have developed expertise in certain product niches. These specialty niche activities focus on the following areas: 

• | Enterprise Value Lending/Senior Debt Financing. We support mid-market company mergers and acquisitions in many domestic markets. We market directly to targeted private equity firms, principally Small Business Investment Companies (“SBICs”), and provide primarily senior debt financing to portfolio companies.


• | Life Insurance Premium Finance. We specialize in financing whole life insurance premiums utilized in high net worth estate planning, through relationships with boutique estate planners throughout the United States.


• | Tax Credit Related Lending. We are a secured lender on affordable housing projects funded through the use of federal and state low income housing tax credits. In addition, we provide leveraged and other loans on projects funded through the U.S. Department of the Treasury Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) New Markets Tax Credit Program. In prior years, we were selected to distribute New Markets Tax Credits, and we continue to participate in the application process, as well as serve as a secured lender to other allocatees.


• | Tax Credit Brokerage. We acquire 10-year streams of Missouri state tax credits from affordable housing development funds and sell the tax credits to clients and other individuals for tax planning purposes. We also have a minority ownership in a partnership that acquires, invests and sells, state low income housing tax credits. We lend the partnership money with 6 - 12 year terms and receive interest income and partnership income when projects close and when credits are sold.


• | Agriculture. We engage in lending to agricultural businesses, including farms, for both real estate loans and operational loans principally in Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas.


• | Enterprise Aircraft Finance. In 2016, we acquired a unit specializing in financing and leasing solutions for the acquisition of owner-operator fixed and rotor wing aircraft. We understand the unique complexities of financing private aircraft, allowing us to tailor a loan structure to meet even the most demanding aircraft leasing and lending requirements.

Fee income business - We offer a broad range of Treasury Management products and services that benefit businesses ranging from large national clients to local merchants. Customized solutions and special product bundles are available to clients of all sizes. In response to ever increasing needs for data/information security and functional efficiency, we 
 2

continue to offer robust cash management systems that employ mobile technology and fraud detection/mitigation services. Enterprise Trust offers a wide range of fiduciary, investment management, and financial advisory services. We employ attorneys, certified financial planners, estate planning professionals, and other investment professionals. Enterprise Trust representatives assist clients in defining lifetime goals and designing plans to achieve them, consistent with our long-term relationship strategy. Our card services include debit cards, credit cards, and merchant services. We also offer international banking, and tax credit businesses that generate fee income.
Capitalizing on technology - Our client technology product offerings include, but are not limited to, internet banking, mobile banking, cash management products, remote deposit capture, positive pay services, fraud detection and prevention, automated payables, check image, and statement and document imaging. Additional service offerings currently supported by the Bank include controlled disbursements, repurchase agreements, and sweep investment accounts. Our cash management suite of products blends technology and personal service, which we believe often creates a competitive advantage over our competition. Technology products are also extensively utilized within the organization by associates in all lines of business including operations and support, customer service, and financial reporting for internal management purposes and for external compliance.
Maintaining asset quality - We monitor asset quality through formal, ongoing, multiple-level reviews of loans in each market and specialized lending niche. These reviews are overseen by the Bank’s credit administration department. In addition, the loan portfolio is subject to ongoing monitoring by a loan review function that reports directly to the Credit Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors. 
Expense management - We manage expenses carefully through detailed budgeting and expense approval processes. We measure the “efficiency ratio” as a benchmark for improvement. The efficiency ratio is equal to noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income).
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On November 1, 2018, the Company and the Bank entered into a definitive agreement with Trinity Capital Corporation (“Trinity”) and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Los Alamos National Bank (“LANB”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire Trinity and LANB. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, upon consummation of the proposed transaction, Trinity shareholders will receive 0.1972 shares of the Company’s common stock and $1.84 in cash for each share of Trinity common stock they hold. Headquartered in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Trinity recorded approximately $1.2 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2018 and serves businesses and residents in Northern New Mexico and the Albuquerque metro area through its six full-service locations. The proposed transaction has been approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and the Missouri Division of Finance. The closing of the proposed transaction, which is anticipated to occur during the first quarter of 2019, remains subject to the approval of Trinity’s shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of all closing conditions.
On February 10, 2017, the Company closed its acquisition of Jefferson County Bancshares, Inc. (“JCB”). JCB merged with and into the Company, and Eagle Bank and Trust Company of Missouri, JCB’s wholly-owned subsidiary bank, merged with and into the Bank. As part of the acquisition, approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock were issued and approximately $29.3 million in cash was paid to JCB shareholders and holders of JCB stock options, for total transaction value of approximately $171 million. The conversion of JCB’s core systems was completed late in the second quarter of 2017.

Between December 2009 and August 2011, the Bank entered into four agreements with the FDIC to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of four failed banks: Valley Capital Bank, Home National Bank, Legacy Bank, and The First National Bank of Olathe. In conjunction with each of these transactions, the Bank entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC, all of which were terminated before or during 2015. Since the termination of these loss share agreements, the Bank has fully recognized recoveries, losses, and expenses related to the assets formerly covered by the agreements, and the FDIC no longer shares in those amounts.

Subordinated Notes
On November 1, 2016, the Company issued $50 million of 4.75% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes with a maturity date of November 1, 2026. The subordinated notes initially bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75%, with interest payable semiannually. Beginning November 1, 2021, the interest rate resets quarterly to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread of 338.7 basis points, payable quarterly. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance to pay the cash consideration at the closing of the acquisition of JCB. 
Market Areas and Approach to Geographic Expansion
We operate in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Phoenix metropolitan areas and expect to expand to northern New Mexico upon consummation of our pending acquisition of Trinity and LANB. The Company, as part of its expansion effort, plans to continue its strategy of operating branches with larger average deposits, and employing experienced staff who are compensated based on performance and customer service.
St. Louis - As of December 31, 2018, we operated 19 banking facilities and three limited service facilities in the St. Louis metropolitan area. We are ranked 4th in deposit market share in the St. Louis metropolitan statistical area. The St. Louis market enjoys a stable, diverse economic base, and is ranked the 21st largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States. It is an attractive market with nearly 132,000 privately held businesses and more than 68,000 households with investable assets of $1.0 million or more. 
Kansas City - We operated in seven banking facilities in the Kansas City market as of December 31, 2018. We are ranked 17th in deposit market share in the Kansas City metropolitan statistical area. Kansas City is an attractive private company market with over 104,000 privately held businesses and more than 49,000 households with investable assets of $1.0 million or more. It is the 30th largest metropolitan statistical area in the U.S.
Phoenix - We operated two banking facilities in the Phoenix metropolitan area as of December 31, 2018. We are ranked 29th in deposit market share in the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area. Phoenix is the nation’s 11th largest metropolitan statistical area, and has more than 232,000 privately held businesses and more than 96,000 households with investable assets over $1.0 million. We believe Phoenix is a dynamic growth market and offers attractive prospects for our business.
New Mexico - Upon consummation of our pending acquisition of Trinity and LANB, we will expand our operations to northern New Mexico. Headquartered in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Trinity serves businesses and residents in northern New Mexico and the Albuquerque metropolitan area through its six full-service locations.
Competition
The Company and its subsidiaries operate in highly competitive markets. Our geographic markets are served by multiple large financial and bank holding companies with substantial capital resources and lending capacity. 
The banking business is highly competitive with respect to virtually all products and services. The industry continues to consolidate, and unregulated competitors in the banking markets have focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments. Many largely unregulated competitors are able to compete across geographic boundaries, and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to nearly all significant banking services and products.
Many of the larger banks dominating the banking business have established specialized units, which target private businesses and high net worth individuals and have many offices operating over a wide geographic area. These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns, and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand. Many of the national or super-regional banks operating in our primary market areas offer certain services that we do not offer. By virtue of their greater total capitalization, national or super-regional banks also have substantially higher lending limits than us. Further, the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Phoenix markets have numerous small community banks with which we compete.
In addition to other financial holding companies and commercial banks, our competitors include credit unions, thrifts, investment managers, insurers, brokerage firms, technology companies, and other providers of financial services and products. Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products, as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
 4

We work to anticipate and adapt to competitive conditions, whether developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, or providing highly personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, no assurances can be given that our efforts to compete in our market areas will continue to be successful.
Supervision and Regulation
The following is a summary description of the relevant laws, rules, and regulations governing banks and financial holding companies. The description of, and references to, the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries and do not purport to be complete. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the related statutes and regulations.
The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of shareholders or creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
Various legislation is from time to time introduced in Congress and Missouri’s legislature. Such legislation may change applicable statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations would have upon our financial condition or upon our results of operations or the results of operations of any of our subsidiaries.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. Some of the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act have been modified by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), signed into law on May 24, 2018.
Notwithstanding the regulatory easing brought about by the Regulatory Relief Act, uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and the Bank’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented while other aspects remain subject to further rulemaking. These regulations will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial industry more generally. However, the Dodd-Frank Act has increased the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company.
Financial Holding Company
The Company is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). As a financial holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, and is required to file periodic reports of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. In order to remain a financial holding company, the Company must continue to be considered well managed and well capitalized by the Federal Reserve, and the Bank must continue to be considered well managed and well capitalized by the FDIC, and have at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the Management Discussion and Analysis for more information on our capital adequacy, and “Bank Subsidiary - Community Reinvestment Act” below for more information on the Community Reinvestment Act.

Stock Repurchase Plans: From time to time the Company may engage in stock repurchases. Formal guidance from the Federal Reserve Board requires that bank and financial holding companies, where certain conditions are triggered, provide prior notice to and consult with the Federal Reserve Board or reserve bank staff prior to implementing a stock repurchase plan. In addition to the formal guidance, the Federal Reserve Board appears to have adopted an informal policy of requiring bank and financial holding companies to seek a safety and soundness “non-objection” from the appropriate regulatory staff prior to implementing a stock repurchase plan, regardless of the financial or capital position of the holding company. In some cases, examiners following this informal policy have required the holding company to produce additional information and materials for review. 
Acquisitions: With certain limited exceptions, the BHCA requires every financial holding company or bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank, (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares), or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Additionally, the BHCA provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly, substantially lessen competition, or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, which is described below.
Change in Bank Control: Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank or financial holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company. Control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities of the Company. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging rebuttable presumptions of control.
Permitted Activities: The BHCA has generally prohibited a bank holding company from engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act have expanded the permissible activities of a bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company. Under the regulations implementing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial holding company may engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities. Those activities include, among other activities, certain insurance, advisory and securities activities.
Support of Bank Subsidiaries: Under Federal Reserve policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, this longstanding policy has been given the force of law, and additional regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve to further implement the statute are possible; however, the bank subsidiary support provisions of the statute are fully effective even absent implementing regulations. As in the past, such financial support from the Company may be required at times when, without this legal requirement, the Company may not be inclined to provide it.
Capital Adequacy: The Company is also subject to capital requirements applied on a consolidated basis, which are substantially similar to those required of the Bank (summarized below).

Dividend Restrictions: Under Federal Reserve policies, financial holding companies may pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition and if the organization is not in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital requirements. Federal Reserve policy also provides that financial holding companies 
 6

should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the financial holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. 
Bank Subsidiary
At December 31, 2018, Enterprise Bank & Trust was our only bank subsidiary. The Bank is a Missouri trust company with banking powers and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Missouri Division of Finance. In addition, as a Federal Reserve non-member bank, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines.
The Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulatory oversight. The various regulatory authorities regulate or monitor all areas of the banking operations, including security devices and procedures, adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves, loans, investments, borrowings, deposits, mergers, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, interest rates payable on deposits, interest rates or fees chargeable on loans, establishment of branches, corporate reorganizations, maintenance of books and records, and adequacy of staff training to carry on safe lending and deposit gathering practices. The Bank must maintain certain capital ratios and is subject to limitations on aggregate investments in real estate, bank premises, low income housing projects, and furniture and fixtures. In connection with their supervision and regulation responsibilities, the Bank is subject to periodic examination by the FDIC and Missouri Division of Finance.
Capital Adequacy: The Bank is required to comply with the FDIC’s capital adequacy standards for insured banks. The FDIC has issued risk-based capital and leverage capital guidelines for measuring capital adequacy, and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for the Bank to be considered in compliance with regulatory capital requirements.
On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all U.S. banking organizations. This regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, implements several changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
The Basel III final rule, effective January 1, 2015, established a new common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”) requirement and increased the tier 1 capital requirement to 6.0%. In addition, all banking organizations must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of CET1 capital in an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions and to pay certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In order to avoid these restrictions, the capital conservation buffer, which has been phased in over the four-year period that began January 1, 2016 with the final incremental increase occurring effective January 1, 2019, effectively increases the minimum CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital ratios for U.S. banking organizations to 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.
As required by the Basel III final rule, capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares have been phased out of tier 1 capital for banking organizations that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, and grandfathered as tier 1 capital such instruments issued by smaller entities prior to May 19, 2010 (provided they do not exceed 25% of tier 1 capital). The Company’s trust preferred securities currently are grandfathered under this provision.
Prompt Corrective Action: The Bank’s capital categories are determined for the purpose of applying the “prompt corrective action” rules described below and may be taken into consideration by banking regulators in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. They are not necessarily an accurate representation of a bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. A failure to meet the capital guidelines could subject the Bank to a variety of enforcement actions under those rules, including the issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits, and other restrictions on its business. As described below, the FDIC also can impose other substantial restrictions on banks that fail to meet applicable capital requirements.
Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized banks. Under this system, the FDIC has established five capital categories (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” 
 7

“undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized”) and is required to take various mandatory supervisory actions, and is authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to banks in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of any such actions taken will depend upon the capital category in which a bank is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, current federal law requires the FDIC to appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank that is critically undercapitalized.
Under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action rules, a bank that (1) has a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (the “Total Capital Ratio”) of 10.0% or greater, a tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (the “Tier 1 Capital Ratio”) of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (the “CET1 Capital Ratio”) of 6.5% or greater, and a tier 1 capital to average assets (the “Leverage Ratio”) of 5.0% or greater, and (2) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the FDIC, is considered to be “well capitalized.” A bank with a Total Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater, a CET1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% or greater, and a Leverage Ratio of 4.0% or greater, is considered to be “adequately capitalized.” A bank that has a Total Capital Ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 Capital Ratio of less than 4.5%, or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0%, is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A bank that has a Total Capital Ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of less than 3.0%, a CET1 Capital Ratio of less than 3.0%, or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0%, is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized,” and a bank that has a tangible equity capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” A bank may be considered to be in a capitalization category lower than indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating or is subject to a regulatory action that requires heightened levels of capital. 
A bank that becomes “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized” is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the FDIC. An “undercapitalized” bank also is generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing new branches, or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Also, the FDIC may treat an “undercapitalized” bank as being “significantly undercapitalized” if it determines that those actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of the law.
All of the Bank’s capital ratios were at levels that qualify it to be “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes as of December 31, 2018.
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection: The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection including implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the “BCFP”). Depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as our Bank, will be subject to rules promulgated by the BCFP, but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
The Bank is also subject to other laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with depository institutions, as well as other laws or regulations affecting customers of financial institutions generally. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations.
UDAP and UDAAP:  Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act - the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce (“UDAP” or “FTC Act”). “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Moreover, the UDAP provisions have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” (“UDAAP”), which has been delegated 
 8

to the BCFP for supervision. The BCFP has brought a variety of enforcement actions for violations of UDAAP provisions and BCFP guidance continues to evolve.
Mortgage Reform:  The BCFP has adopted final rules implementing minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including standards regarding a customer’s ability to repay, restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay variable-rate loans be determined by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions. While the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the BCFP, the Regulatory Relief Act provided certain presumptions of qualified mortgage status for banks with assets of less than $10 billion, subject to certain documentation and product issues.
Dividends by the Bank Subsidiary: Under Missouri law, the Bank may pay dividends to the Company only from a portion of its undivided profits and may not pay dividends if its capital is impaired. As an insured depository institution, federal law prohibits the Bank from making any capital distributions, including the payment of a cash dividend if it is “undercapitalized” or after making the distribution would become undercapitalized. If the FDIC believes the Bank is engaged in, or about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice, the FDIC may require, after notice and hearing, that the bank cease and desist from that practice. The FDIC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The FDIC has issued policy statements that provide that insured banks generally should pay dividends only from their current operating earnings. The Bank’s payment of dividends also could be affected or limited by other factors, such as events or circumstances which lead the FDIC to require that it maintain capital in excess of regulatory guidelines.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders:  The Bank is subject to the provisions of Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve, which encompasses Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Regulation W places limits and conditions on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to, investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. Regulation W also prohibits, among other things, an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Federal law also places restrictions on the Bank’s ability to extend credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties; and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
Community Reinvestment Act: The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC shall evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. The Bank has a satisfactory rating under CRA.
USA PATRIOT Act: The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) requires each financial institution to: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks; and (iii) implement certain due diligence policies, procedures and controls with regard to correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities.
Commercial Real Estate Lending: The Bank’s lending operations may be subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators based on its concentration of commercial real estate loans. On December 6, 2006, the federal banking regulators issued final guidance to remind financial institutions of the risk posed by commercial real estate

(“CRE”) lending concentrations. CRE loans generally include land development, construction loans, and loans secured by multifamily property, and non-farm, nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the following guidelines for its examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to significant CRE risk, including concentrations in certain types of CRE that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of the institutions total capital; or total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more.
Volcker Rule: On December 10, 2013, the federal regulators adopted final regulations to implement the proprietary trading and private fund prohibitions of the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final regulations, banking entities are generally prohibited, subject to significant exceptions from: (i) short-term proprietary trading as principal in securities and other financial instruments, and (ii) sponsoring or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in private equity and hedge funds. The Regulatory Relief Act provided an exemption from the above restrictions for banks with less than $10 billion in assets.
Governmental Policies
The operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) regulates monetary policy and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of all financial institutions in the past and may continue to do so in the future.
The current U.S. administration has put in place changes to the financial services industry, including changes to policies and regulations that implement current federal law, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as a focus on reviewing and revising regulations promulgated during the prior administration. These changes were furthered by the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act. At this point we are unable to determine what impact potential policy changes might have on the Company or its subsidiaries.

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 22, 2019, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Loan Agreement (the “Amendment”) with another bank. The Loan Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated February 24, 2016 was previously amended by the First Amendment to Loan Agreement dated February 23, 2017, and by the Second Amendment to Loan Agreement dated February 23, 2018. Pursuant to the Amendment, the lender committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amendment, to make a term loan in the original principal amount of up to $40.0 million (the “Term Loan”), and a revolving credit loan for which the aggregate principal amount shall not exceed $25.0 million (the “Loan”). The loans each have an annual interest rate of 1.25% plus the one-month LIBOR rate.  
The Term Loan has a five-year maturity. The effective date of the Term Loan will be prior to May 31, 2019. The proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used by the Company solely to fund the proposed acquisition of Trinity Capital Corporation. 
The Loan matures on February 23, 2020. The proceeds of the Loan will be used for general corporate purposes. The Loan also bears a non-usage fee calculated based on the average daily principal balance of the Loan outstanding during the prior fiscal quarter.
The Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including without limitation, financial covenants requiring that the Company, or its Bank subsidiary, as applicable, maintain: (1) a ratio of Loan Loss Reserves to Non-Performing Loans of not less than 80%; (2) a ratio of Non-Performing Assets to Tangible Primary Capital not to exceed 18%; (3) such capital as may be necessary to be classified as a “well capitalized” institution under regulatory guidelines; (4) a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio equal to or greater than 11.25% and 10.5% for the Company and its Bank subsidiary, respectively; and (5) a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of not less than 1.35 to 1.  At any time after the occurrence of an event of default under the Agreement, the lender may, among other options, terminate its commitment to make loans to the Company and declare any amounts outstanding under the Agreement immediately due and payable. The foregoing summary of the Agreement and Amendment is only a brief description of the terms and conditions therein, does not purport to be a complete description of the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and the complete text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
