Company Background
 
American Cannabis Company, Inc. and subsidiary is a publicly listed company quoted on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets Tier under the symbol “AMMJ”. We are based in Denver, Colorado and operate a fully-integrated business model that features end-to-end solutions for businesses operating in regulated cannabis industry in states and countries where cannabis is regulated and/or has been de-criminalized for medical use and/or legalized for recreational use. We provide advisory and consulting services specific to this industry, design industry-specific products and facilities, and manage a strategic group partnership that offers both exclusive and non-exclusive customer products commonly used in the industry.
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed on September 24, 2001 with the name Naturewell, Inc., which became Brazil Interactive Media, Inc. (“BIMI”) on March 13, 2013 pursuant to a merger transaction that resulted in the Company becoming the owner of a Brazilian interactive television technology and television production company, BIMI, Inc. We became American Cannabis Company, Inc. on September 29, 2014, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 15, 2014 (the “Merger Agreement”) between the Company, Cannamerica Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BIMI, and Hollister & Blacksmith, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of American Cannabis Consulting (“American Cannabis Consulting”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which was consummated and became effective on September 29, 2014, Merger Sub was merged with and into American Cannabis Consulting through a reverse triangular merger transaction (the “Reverse Merger”), we changed our name to “American Cannabis Company, Inc.”, and our officers and directors in office prior to the Merger Agreement resigned and American Cannabis Consulting appointed new officers and directors to serve our Company. In concert with the Merger Agreement, we consummated a complete divestiture of BIMI, Inc. pursuant to a Separation and Exchange Agreement dated May 16, 2014 (the “Separation Agreement”) between the Company, BIMI, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Brazil Investment Holding, LLC (“Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company. On October 10, 2014, we changed our stock symbol from BIMI to AMMJ.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement and Separation Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of such agreements, which are filed as exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on October 3, 2014.
 
Industry and Regulatory Overview
 
The Company is not engaged in the direct growth, cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis. However, we do offer consulting services to licensed operators and applicants for state offered cannabis licenses, who seek to engage in the medical and/or recreational cannabis business in those state jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized. We also sell ancillary products which are used in the legalized cannabis industry.
 
As of the date of this filing, thirty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws broadly legalizing cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis is a “Schedule 1” drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), and is illegal under federal law.

On August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The “Cole Memorandum” provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 “Cole Memorandum”.
 
In rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
 
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis.”
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so illegal under the federal CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under the CSA, and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 
The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.

Research and Development 
 
As a component of our equipment and supplies offerings, from time-to-time we design and develop our own proprietary products to meet demand in markets where current offerings are insufficient. These products include, but are not limited to: The Satchel™, Cultivation Cube™, So-Hum Living Soils™ and the HDCS™. Costs associated with the development of new products are expensed as occurred as research and development operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our research and development costs were $590, as compared to $2,403 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. 
Significant Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, three customers accounted for 47.50% or more, respectively of the Company’s total product sales revenues, and four customers accounted for 70.65% or more respectively of the Company’s total service based revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three customers accounted 48.95% or more, respectively of the Company’s total product sales revenues, and four customers accounted for 40.18% or more respectively of the Company’s total service based revenue.
Intellectual Property
 
On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued patent number 9,296,524 B2 for The Satchel™, our child-proof exit package solution for the regulated cannabis industry. We also have pending trademark applications pending to protect our branding and logos. These pending applications included trademarks for American Cannabis Company (stylized and/or with design logo), American Cannabis Consulting (stylized and/or with design logo), the design and colors used in our leaf logo, the Cultivation Cube (stylized and/or with design logo), our slogan (“Growing the Next Frontier”), and two-word marks and the logo associated with So-Hum Living Soil™. 
Competition
 
Our competitors include professional services firms dedicated to the regulated cannabis and hemp industries, as well as suppliers of equipment and supplies commonly utilized in the cultivation, processing, or retail sale of cannabis and hemp. We compete in markets where cannabis and hemp has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States, it’s territories and Indian Country therein and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the cannabis and hemp industries mature. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience and success to date, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our operations and results. 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have 6 full-time employees, all of whom are U.S based, primarily in Colorado at our Denver headquarters. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
