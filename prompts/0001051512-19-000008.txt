Item 1.  Business
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) is a diversified telecommunications company providing high-quality communications services to customers with 5.0 million wireless connections and 1.2 million wireline and cable connections at December 31, 2018. TDS conducts all of its wireless operations through its majority-owned subsidiary, United States Cellular Corporation (U.S. Cellular). As of December 31, 2018, TDS owned 82% of the combined total of the outstanding Common Shares and Series A Common Shares of U.S. Cellular and controlled 96% of the combined voting power of both classes of U.S. Cellular common stock. TDS provides broadband, video and voice services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TDS Telecommunications LLC (TDS Telecom). TDS was incorporated in 1968 and is incorporated in Delaware. TDS Common Shares trade under the ticker symbol “TDS” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). U.S. Cellular Common Shares trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “USM.”
Under listing standards of the NYSE, TDS is a “controlled company” as such term is defined by the NYSE. TDS is a controlled company because over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of TDS is held by the trustees of the TDS Voting Trust.
TDS has three business segments: U.S. Cellular and TDS Telecom’s Wireline and Cable. TDS operations also include the operations of its wholly-owned hosted and managed services (HMS) subsidiary, which operates under the OneNeck IT Solutions brand, and its wholly-owned printing subsidiary Suttle-Straus, Inc. (Suttle-Straus). HMS' and Suttle-Straus’ financial results were not significant to TDS’ operations. All of TDS’ segments operate only in the United States, except for HMS, which includes an insignificant foreign operation.
TDS re-evaluated internal reporting roles with regard to its HMS business unit and, as a result, changed its reportable segments. Effective January 1, 2018, HMS was considered a non-reportable segment and is no longer being reported under TDS Telecom. Additional information about TDS’ segments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 18 — Business Segment Information in TDS’ Annual Report to Shareholders, filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.
The map below highlights TDS’ consolidated areas of operations:

U.S. CELLULAR OPERATIONS
General
U.S. Cellular, incorporated under the state laws of Delaware in 1983, provides wireless telecommunications services to customers with 5.0 million connections in 22 states collectively representing a total population of 31 million.  U.S. Cellular operates in one reportable segment, and all of its wireless operating markets are in the United States.  U.S. Cellular’s strategy is to attract and retain wireless customers through a value proposition comprised of a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans, and pricing, all provided with a local focus.
Customers, Services and Products
Customers.  U.S. Cellular provides service to postpaid and prepaid customers from a variety of demographic segments.  U.S. Cellular focuses on retail consumers, government entities, and small-to-mid-size business customers in industries such as construction, retail, agriculture, professional services and real estate.  These customers are served primarily through U.S. Cellular’s retail and direct sales channels.  U.S. Cellular builds customer loyalty by offering high-quality network services, outstanding customer-focused support services, competitive pricing, and other benefits as discussed further in “Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels” below.
Services.  U.S. Cellular’s customers are able to choose from a variety of national plans with voice, messaging and data usage options and pricing that are designed to fit different customer needs, usage patterns and budgets. Helping a customer find the right plan is an important element of U.S. Cellular’s brand positioning. In 2018, U.S. Cellular introduced the Unlimited with Payback plan that provides a monthly bill credit to postpaid customers if they have used less than 3 gigabytes of data per line. U.S. Cellular’s national plans price all domestic calls as local calls, regardless of where they are made or received in the United States, with no long distance or roaming charges, made possible by roaming agreements with other wireless carriers. See “Network Technology, Roaming, and System Design” section below for further discussion related to roaming. 
U.S. Cellular’s portfolio of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices is a key part of its strategy to deliver wireless devices that allow customers to stay productive, entertained and connected on the go; these devices are backed by U.S. Cellular’s high-speed fourth generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network.  U.S. Cellular’s 4G LTE network features smartphone messaging, data and internet services that allow customers to access the internet; text, picture and video message; utilize GPS navigation; and browse and download thousands of applications to customize their wireless devices to fit their lifestyles.  U.S. Cellular’s Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) technology, which has been launched successfully in multiple markets, enables customers to utilize the 4G LTE network for both voice and data services, and offers enhanced services such as high definition voice and simultaneous voice and data sessions. U.S. Cellular also offers advanced wireless solutions to consumers and business and government customers, including a growing suite of connected machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions and software applications across the categories of monitor and control (e.g., sensors and cameras), business automation/operations (e.g., e-forms), communication (e.g., enterprise messaging, back-up router for business continuity services) and asset management (e.g., telematics, fleet management).  U.S. Cellular intends to continue to further enhance these offerings for customers in 2019 and beyond. 
Devices and Products.  U.S. Cellular offers a comprehensive range of wireless devices such as handsets, tablets, mobile hotspots, home phones and routers for use by its customers.  U.S. Cellular offers wireless devices that are compatible with its 4G LTE and third generation (3G) networks and are compliant with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enhanced wireless 911 requirements.  In addition, U.S. Cellular also offers a wide range of accessories, including wireless essentials such as cases, screen protectors, chargers, and memory cards as well as an assortment of consumer electronics such as headphones, smart speakers, wearables and home automation products (e.g., cameras, sensors, and thermostats).
Throughout 2018, new postpaid handset sales to retail consumers were made primarily under equipment installment plans (EIP); business and government customers may continue to purchase equipment under alternative plans subject to a service contract.  For certain installment plans, after a specified period of time or number of payments, the customer may have the right to upgrade to a new device prior to reaching the end of the installment term, thus enabling customers to access the latest smartphones and provide a better overall customer experience. 
U.S. Cellular also offers accessories for purchase on installment plans. These plans allow new and existing postpaid customers to purchase certain accessories payable over a specified time period. These accessory installment plans are available through U.S. Cellular company-owned retail stores, telesales channels, and agent channels using direct fulfillment with U.S. Cellular’s inventory.
U.S. Cellular continues to offer device service programs that provide customers a simple process to replace a defective device. U.S. Cellular also offers its Trade-In program where U.S. Cellular buys consumers’ used equipment, Device Protection+ program, which includes overnight delivery of a replacement device for damaged, lost and stolen devices, Device Protection+ Advanced program, which includes 100GB of data backup, TechSupport+, and AppleCare services for Apple iOS customers.
U.S. Cellular offers a full array of iconic smartphones with options for both Android and iOS customers.  U.S. Cellular continues to bolster its expanding smartphone portfolio with the Samsung Galaxy S® 9/9+ and Note 9, the iPhone® XS/XS Max and XR, the LG V40 ThinQ, and the Motorola Z3 Play.  Along with the iconic devices, U.S. Cellular supports the larger ecosystem of Samsung and Apple devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch, the Samsung Gear Sport and the Apple Watch Series 4.  For tablets, U.S. Cellular offers the full complement of iPads and the Samsung Galaxy Tab series.  U.S. Cellular’s smartphone offerings play a significant role in attracting customers and driving data service usage and revenues. U.S. Cellular also offers additional services and products that utilize U.S. Cellular's network, including feature phones, mobile hotspots, LTE wireless routers, LTE wireless cameras, and home phones.

U.S. Cellular purchases wireless devices and accessory products from a number of original equipment manufacturers and distributors, including Samsung, Apple, Motorola, LG, Kyocera, Inseego, Netgear, Tessco, Voicecomm and Superior.  U.S. Cellular manages relationships with its suppliers to ensure best possible pricing and identifies opportunities for promotional support. U.S. Cellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure; rather, it contracts with third party providers for the majority of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities.  U.S. Cellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device service programs.
U.S. Cellular continuously monitors the financial condition of its wireless device and accessory suppliers.  Since U.S. Cellular has a diversified portfolio of products from more than one supplier, U.S. Cellular does not expect the financial condition of any single supplier to affect its ability to offer a competitive portfolio of wireless devices and accessories for sale to customers.
Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels
Marketing and Advertising.  U.S. Cellular’s marketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality wireless network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of services and products built around customer needs at fair prices with a local focus.  U.S. Cellular believes that creating positive relationships with its customers enhances their wireless experience and builds customer loyalty.  U.S. Cellular currently offers several customer-centric programs and services to customers. 
To attract potential new customers and retain existing customers, and increase their usage of U.S. Cellular’s services, U.S. Cellular’s advertising is directed at increasing the public awareness of the U.S. Cellular brand, knowledge of the outstanding network that works in places where other carriers do not have coverage, and understanding of the wireless services it offers. U.S. Cellular supplements its advertising with a focused public relations program that improves overall brand sentiment and awareness, encourages engagement, supports sales of services and products, and builds preference and loyalty for the U.S. Cellular brand.  The approach combines national and local media relations in mainstream and social media channels with market-wide activities, events, and sponsorships.
U.S. Cellular focuses its charitable giving on initiatives relevant to consumers in its service areas.  These initiatives include programs that focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) activities for youth in the communities U.S. Cellular serves and often involve collaboration with organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
Customer Service.  U.S. Cellular manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through the development of processes that are customer-friendly, extensive training of frontline sales and support associates and the implementation of retention programs.
U.S. Cellular currently operates four regional customer care centers in its operating markets with personnel who are responsible for customer service activities, and a national financial services center with personnel who perform credit and other customer payment activities.  U.S. Cellular also contracts with third parties that provide additional customer care and financial services support.
Sales and Distribution Channels.  U.S. Cellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, third-party national retailers, and independent agents, plus a website and telesales.
Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless services and products to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. As of December 31, 2018, retail sales associates work in 259 U.S. Cellular-operated retail stores and kiosks.  Direct sales representatives sell traditional wireless services as well as Internet of Things (IoT) and M2M products and solutions to medium- and large-sized businesses and government entities.  Additionally, the U.S. Cellular website enables customers to purchase wireless devices online.
U.S. Cellular maintains an ongoing training program to improve the effectiveness of retail sales associates and direct sales representatives by focusing their efforts on obtaining customers by facilitating the sale of appropriate packages for the customer’s expected usage and value-added services that meet the individual needs of the customer.
U.S. Cellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents (collectively “agents”), which are independent businesses that obtain customers for U.S. Cellular on a commission basis.  At December 31, 2018, U.S. Cellular had contracts with these businesses aggregating 436 locations.  U.S. Cellular provides support and training to its agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience.  U.S. Cellular’s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service packages and other related products.  No single agent accounted for 10% or more of U.S. Cellular’s operating revenues during the past three years.
U.S. Cellular services and products also are offered through third-party national and on-line retailers.  Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club, Family Dollar and Dollar General offer U.S. Cellular services and products at select retail locations in U.S. Cellular’s service areas. U.S. Cellular continues to explore new relationships with additional third-party retailers as part of its strategy to expand distribution. 
Seasonality.  Seasonality in operating expenses may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter.  U.S. Cellular’s operating expenses tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season.

Competition
The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive.  U.S. Cellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets.  In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which U.S. Cellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).  In its footprint, U.S. Cellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility, Sprint, and T-Mobile USA, in addition to a few smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint.  All of the national competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than U.S. Cellular.  In addition, U.S. Cellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar services and products. 
Since each of these wireless competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of services and products, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service.  U.S. Cellular employs a customer satisfaction strategy that includes maintaining an outstanding wireless network throughout its markets.  U.S. Cellular owns and operates low-band spectrum (less than 1 GHz) that covers the majority of its footprint and enables more efficient coverage in rural areas (compared to spectrum above 1 GHz), which strengthens its network quality positioning.  To the extent existing competitors or new entrants hold or acquire such spectrum in U.S. Cellular markets, U.S. Cellular could face increased competition over time. In addition, industry deployment of fifth generation (5G) technology could introduce increased competition from industry participants on bases such as network speed and new product offerings.
The use of national advertising and promotional programs by the top four wireless service providers is a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures in all U.S. Cellular markets, even if those operators do not provide direct service in a particular market.  Over the past year, competition among top carriers has continued to be robust, with the top four carriers offering unlimited plans as well as device price reductions.  In addition, in the current wireless environment, U.S. Cellular’s ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to offer national voice and data plans. U.S. Cellular provides wireless services comparable to the national competitors, but the national wireless companies operate in a wider geographic area and are able to provide such services over a wider area on their own networks than U.S. Cellular can offer on its network.  Although U.S. Cellular offers similar coverage area as these competitors, U.S. Cellular incurs roaming charges for data sessions and calls made in portions of the coverage area which are not part of its network, thereby increasing its cost of operations.  U.S. Cellular depends on roaming agreements with other wireless carriers to provide voice and data roaming capabilities in areas not covered by U.S. Cellular’s network.  Similarly, U.S. Cellular provides roaming services on its network to other wireless carriers’ customers who travel within U.S. Cellular’s coverage areas and receives revenue from other carriers for the provision of these services.
Convergence of connectivity is taking place on many levels, including wireless devices that can act as wireless or wireline replacement devices and the incorporation of wireless “hot spot” technology in wireless devices making internet access seamless regardless of location.  Although less directly a substitute for other wireless services, wireless data services such as Wi-Fi may be adequate for those who do not need mobile wide-area roaming or full two-way voice services. If the trend toward convergence continues, U.S. Cellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers, traditional cable companies, MVNOs and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence.  Cable companies have begun to compete in the wireless market.  Most notably, Comcast and Charter currently offer wireless services.
U.S. Cellular’s approach in 2019 and in future years will be to focus on the unique needs and attitudes of its customers towards wireless service.  U.S. Cellular will deliver high-quality services and products at competitive prices and intends to continue to differentiate itself by seeking to provide an overall outstanding customer experience, founded on a high-quality network.  U.S. Cellular’s ability to compete successfully in the future will depend upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changes related to new service offerings, consumer preferences, competitors’ pricing strategies and new product offerings, technology, demographic trends, economic conditions and its access to adequate spectrum resources.
Network Technology, Roaming, and System Design
Technology.  Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice, data, graphics and video through the transmission of signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC.  Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections.  A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, will remain an important factor for U.S. Cellular to remain competitive.
VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services, and offers enhanced services such as high definition voice and simultaneous voice and data sessions. In addition, the deployment of VoLTE technology expands U.S. Cellular’s ability to offer roaming services to other wireless carriers. VoLTE technology has been launched successfully in California, Iowa, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin, and deployments in several additional operating markets will occur in 2019. 
5G technology is expected to help address customers’ growing demand for data services as well as create opportunities for new services requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. U.S. Cellular is committed to continuous technology innovation and continues to prepare for deployment of 5G technology beginning in 2019, including commencing a trial utilizing 5G standards and equipment on its core LTE network in the fourth quarter of 2018. U.S. Cellular is partnering with leading companies in the wireless infrastructure and handset ecosystem to provide rich 5G experiences for customers. In addition, in the markets where U.S. Cellular commercially deploys 5G technology, which will include communities of various sizes, customers using U.S. Cellular’s 4G LTE network will experience increased network speed due to U.S. Cellular's modernization efforts. The deployment of 5G technology will require substantial investments in spectrum and U.S. Cellular’s networks to remain competitive. 
4

Roaming.  A secondary source of revenue for U.S. Cellular is from customers of other wireless operators who roam on its network. Inter-carrier roaming agreements are negotiated between the wireless operators to enable customers who are in a wireless service area other than the customer’s home service area to place or receive a call or text message, or to use data services, in that service area.  U.S. Cellular has entered into reciprocal roaming agreements with operators of other wireless systems covering virtually all systems with Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in the United States.  In addition, U.S. Cellular has entered into reciprocal 4G LTE roaming agreements with national wireless companies and, as a result, a majority of U.S. Cellular customers currently have access to nationwide 4G LTE service. 
Another digital technology, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), has a larger installed base of customers worldwide.  U.S. Cellular customers now have the ability to roam on GSM carriers with voice, data and text messaging in Canada, Mexico and internationally.  Both CDMA and GSM technologies are being succeeded by 4G LTE, VoLTE and 5G technology. 
System Design and Construction.  U.S. Cellular designs and constructs its systems in a manner it believes will permit it to provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices.  Designs are based on engineering studies which relate to specific markets, in support of the larger network.  Network reliability is given careful consideration and extensive backup redundancy is employed in many aspects of U.S. Cellular’s network design.  Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topology and extensive use of emergency standby power also are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruption from any particular network element failure.
In accordance with its strategy of building and strengthening its operating market areas, U.S. Cellular has selected high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office.  Centralized equipment, used for network and data management, is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy.  U.S. Cellular’s systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network.  Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology for nearly all 4G LTE sites, over fiber or microwave links.
As a result of increasing demand for high–speed data and the deployment of 5G technology, U.S. Cellular expects to acquire additional spectrum licenses and to make significant investments in its network to provide sufficient capacity and throughput. 
Construction of wireless systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment for land and improvements, buildings, towers, mobile telephone switching offices, cell site equipment, transport equipment, engineering and installation.  U.S. Cellular primarily uses its own personnel to engineer each wireless system it owns and operates, and engages contractors to construct the facilities.
The costs (inclusive of the costs to acquire licenses) to develop the systems which U.S. Cellular operates have historically been financed primarily through proceeds from debt offerings, with cash generated by operations, and proceeds from the sales of wireless interests and other non-strategic assets.
Business Development Strategy
U.S. Cellular operates a regional wireless network. U.S. Cellular’s interests in wireless licenses include both direct interests whereby U.S. Cellular is the licensee and investment interests in entities which are licensees; together, these direct and investment interests involve operating and non-operating licenses covering 30 states and a total population of approximately 50 million at December 31, 2018.
U.S. Cellular’s business development strategy is to obtain interests in or access to wireless licenses in its current operating markets and in areas that are adjacent to or in close proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building larger geographic operating market areas.  U.S. Cellular believes that the acquisition of additional licenses within its current operating markets will enhance its network capacity and speed to meet its customers’ growing demand for data services.  From time to time, U.S. Cellular has divested outright or included in exchanges for other wireless interests certain consolidated and investment interests that were considered less essential to its current and expected future operations.  As part of its business development strategy, U.S. Cellular may periodically be engaged in negotiations relating to the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties, investment interests or wireless spectrum.
The FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services.  Historically, U.S. Cellular has participated in certain FCC auctions both directly and indirectly through its limited partnership interests. At its open meeting on August 2, 2018, the FCC adopted a public notice establishing procedures for two auctions of Millimeter Wave spectrum licenses in the 28 GHz and 24 GHz bands. The 28 GHz auction (Auction 101), which commenced on November 14, 2018 and closed on January 24, 2019, offered two 425 MHz licenses in the 28 GHz band over portions of the United States that do not have incumbent licensees. The 24 GHz auction (Auction 102) will offer up to seven 100 MHz licenses in the 24 GHz band in Partial Economic Areas covering most of the United States. Upfront payments for Auction 102 were due by February 19, 2019, and bidding in Auction 102 is scheduled to begin on March 14, 2019. U.S. Cellular filed applications to participate in both auctions on September 18, 2018, and was announced as a qualified bidder for Auction 101 on October 31, 2018. The FCC has not announced qualified bidders for Auction 102. Also, at the open meeting on August 2, 2018, the FCC adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in preparation for an additional Millimeter Wave auction offering licenses in the 37, 39 and 47 GHz bands. FCC statements indicate plans to hold this auction in the second half of 2019. The spectrum auctioned in each of these Millimeter Wave auctions is expected to be used primarily to deliver 5G technology.

Both Wireline and Cable share a common growth strategy to provide high-speed data services bundled with video entertainment and voice services. In Wireline, TDS Telecom is focused on investing in fiber to the home technologies to provide high-speed internet services of up to 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps) to new and existing markets. Increased fiber deployment provides the opportunity to deliver more robust residential and commercial products which drives future growth. Fiber builds in locations outside of its current markets allows TDS Telecom to target the most attractive markets to increase its total footprint. TDS Telecom has completed the construction of a fiber network in an initial out-of-territory market which has provided the basis for expanding this strategy. Therefore, several additional new locations are currently being built with fiber to expand its footprint into attractive markets that are underserved today. Similarly, in its Cable markets, TDS Telecom is also focused on providing high-speed data services, offering up to 600 Megabits per second (Mbps) data speeds over its DOCSIS 3.0 network, and investing in fiber-to-home construction in new housing developments in these fast growing markets.
TDS Telecom may also seek to grow its operations through the acquisition of businesses that support and complement its existing markets or create entirely new clusters of markets where TDS Telecom can succeed. TDS Telecom intends to avoid markets served by other fiber overbuilders or municipalities which have constructed their own networks with fiber to the home. 
Core Network
In order to provide IP-based services, TDS Telecom has developed and deployed an inter-regional data routing infrastructure using owned and leased fiber capacity which allows it to leverage its multi-terabit core network in both Wireline and Cable operations.  This configuration, along with the continued development of an IP network that interconnects substantially all the existing service territories, allows for next generation IP service offerings.
The TDS Telecom core network continues to standardize equipment and processes to increase efficiency in maintaining its network.  TDS Telecom utilizes centralized monitoring and management of its network to reduce costs and improve service reliability.

Wireline is focusing its investments on broadband as the core growth component of its service offerings.  Wireline believes that its residential and business customers have a strong preference to purchase complementary telecommunications services from a single provider.  The Wireline residential customer strategy is to provide broadband, video and voice services either individually or through value-added bundling of these services. Wireline has found that by delivering the best broadband speeds combined with a robust video experience, it can build customer loyalty and promote growth.  The commercial focus is to provide a suite of advanced IP-based data and voice services to customers primarily ranging in size from sole proprietors to small- and medium-sized businesses.
To attract and retain customers in the video business, TDS Telecom is developing a next generation video platform called TDS TV+ which will enhance the customer experience by adding interfaces to mobile devices, personalized content recommendations, and network-based DVR functionality.  TDS TV+ will be offered in its Wireline and Cable operations and will offer video content and features not available on existing TDS platforms.
Residential.  Wireline residential customer operations provide high-speed data, video and voice services. TDS Telecom features a wide range of reliable, affordable speeds to fit every lifestyle and every budget, including 1 Gbps internet. In selected residential markets, Wireline’s marketing and promotional strategies include a focus on its Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service offering under the brand TDS TV.  This IP based video offering is intended to counter intensifying competition for video services.  In markets where IPTV is not offered, TDS Telecom has partnered with a satellite TV provider to allow for triple or double play bundling.  Approximately 78% of ILEC customers have at least two services.
Commercial.  Wireline commercial customer operations provide broadband, IP-based services, and hosted voice and collaboration services to small- to medium-sized businesses.  Wireline operations provide commercial customers with secure and reliable internet access, data connections and advanced voice service with VoIP features.  TDS Telecom's commercial service focus is to lead with superior broadband bundled with a voice product from a suite of solutions.
Wholesale.  Wireline operations continue to provide a high level of service to traditional interexchange and wireless carriers.  Wireline’s wholesale market focus is on access revenues, which is the compensation received from the interexchange carriers for carrying data and voice traffic on TDS Telecom’s networks.  Federal Connect America Fund (CAF) and state Universal Service Fund (USF) revenues, which support the cost of providing telecommunication services in underserved high cost areas, are also included in wholesale service revenues. 
In 2017, TDS began receiving $75 million per year for 10 years (with incremental funding for transition in the early years for certain states) for operating and maintaining its network along with the obligation to provide broadband service at various speeds to about 160,000 locations.  In 2018, the FCC authorized and issued an order for TDS Telecom to receive an additional $3 million of support per year for ten years retroactive to January 2017. Continuing regulatory changes may affect the amounts of future Wireline wholesale revenues.  See additional information in Risk Factors and information incorporated by reference from Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section “Regulatory Matters”.
Access Technology and System Design
Wireline operates an integrated, highly-reliable network that consists of central office host and remote sites, primarily equipped with digital and IP switches.  Fiber optic and copper cable connect the host central offices with remote switches and ultimately with end customers.  Wireline continues to upgrade and expand its telecommunications network to respond to the needs of its customers for greater bandwidth and advanced technologies.  Broadband service is provided to 96% of Wireline’s ILEC service addresses.  The network is transitioning from its legacy circuit-switched network to a highly reliable IP-based broadband network to facilitate the integration of broadband, video and voice services. 
Wireline pursues a plan to deploy fiber-to-the-home technology, which enables significantly greater broadband speeds to selected residential subdivisions and to commercial customers, when the investment is economically justified.  Fiber technology is deployed to provide internet speeds of up to 1 Gbps.  In addition, in non-fiber markets, data speeds are increased through the use of fiber-to-the-node and copper bonding / vectoring technology.  Approximately 49% of Wireline service addresses were capable of 25 Mbps or greater broadband speeds at the end of 2018.
Competition
The competitive environment in the telecommunications industry has changed significantly as a result of technological advances, customer expectations, and changes to regulation.  Wireline continues to seek to develop and maintain an efficient cost structure to ensure that it can compete with price-based initiatives from competitors.  Wireline faces significant challenges, including competition from cable, low-cost voice providers, other wireline and wireless providers as well as decreases in compensation received for the use of TDS Telecom’s networks. 
Wireline has experienced customer connection and access minute declines due to competition from wireless carriers offering local and nationwide voice and data plans, from cable providers offering voice and data services via cable modems, from fiber overbuilders, and from other low cost voice providers.

Cable companies have developed technological improvements that have allowed them to extend their competitive operations beyond major markets and have enabled them to provide a broader range of data and voice services over their cable networks.  Cable companies have aggressively pursued the bundling of data, video and voice products at discounted prices to attract customers from traditional telephone companies.  In addition, cable companies continue to add value to their internet offerings by increasing speeds at little to no additional cost to the customer.  Wireline estimates that 80% of its ILEC service addresses face active competition from cable providers at December 31, 2018.  Cable companies are increasingly targeting commercial customers.
Wireless telephone service providers offering feature-rich wireless devices and improved network quality constitute a significant source of voice and broadband competition.  A growing segment of customers have chosen to completely forego the use of traditional wireline telephone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice communications services.  This trend is more pronounced among residential customers, which comprise approximately 66% of Wireline connections as of December 31, 2018.  Some small businesses have followed the residential path by choosing wireless service and disconnecting wireline voice service. 
While TDS Telecom positions itself as a high-quality telecommunications provider, it is also experiencing competition from Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in areas where TDS Telecom competes as a CLEC. Approximately 20% of TDS Telecom's customer connections are within CLEC operations.  The RBOCs are continuing to implement technological changes that could impede TDS Telecom’s access to facilities used to provide CLEC telecommunications services. In addition, the RBOCs have petitioned the FCC to stop enforcing requirements that allow CLECs to access that infrastructure at wholesale rates.  To mitigate these risks, TDS Telecom has refocused the business on serving customers who do not require leased facilities.
Cable
Operations
TDS Telecom entered the cable business with TDS' acquisition of Baja Broadband in 2013. Subsequently, in 2014, TDS acquired substantially all of the assets of a group of companies operating as BendBroadband, headquartered in Bend, Oregon.  TDS Telecom’s cable business leverages its Wireline core competencies in network management and customer focus, and operates under two brand names: TDS Cable in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah; and BendBroadband in Oregon.
Similar to Wireline, the Cable strategy is to expand its broadband services and leverage that growth by bundling with video and voice services.  Through investment in plant upgrades and improvements in programming and customer service levels, TDS Telecom intends to strengthen its markets and continue to grow its revenue base.
Customers, Services and Products
Residential.  Cable offers advanced broadband, video and voice services.  These services are actively bundled at competitive prices to encourage cross-selling within Cable’s customer base and to attract new customers.  Approximately 56% of residential customers subscribe to a bundle of services.

• | Broadband: DOCSIS 3.0 technology is deployed to nearly all of Cable’s service addresses which allows it to offer enhanced transmission speeds. TDS Telecom is offering 600 Mbps in almost all its markets with up to 1 Gbps service available in select markets. Access to 24/7 technical support and security features is also provided to broadband customers. The implementation of DOCSIS 3.1 technology is currently underway and will offer significantly higher speeds of up to 1 Gbps. 


• | Video: Customers have access to basic service, premium programming and high-definition television combined with DVR service. Cable introduced “CatchTV,” a branded whole-home DVR solution. 


• | To attract and retain customers in the video business, TDS Telecom is developing a next generation video platform called TDS TV+ which will enhance the customer experience by adding interfaces to mobile devices, personalized content recommendations and network-based DVR functionality. TDS TV+ will be offered in its Wireline and Cable operations and will offer video content and features not available on existing TDS platforms. 


• | Voice: Telephony service uses IP to transport digitized voice signals over the same private network that brings cable television and broadband services to customers. All residential voice service customers have access to direct international calling and can subscribe to various long distance plans. 

Commercial.  Business services are delivered over a robust network to provide broadband products, multi-line phone solutions and video.  Cable provides advanced business services, including data networking, Ethernet, broadband access and VoIP services, to small- and medium-sized businesses.
Access Technology and System Design
Cable’s telecommunication systems are designed to transmit broadband, video and voice services using a hybrid fiber-coaxial network that consists of optical fiber transport from a headend facility to nodes where coaxial cable is then used to reach residential and business customers.  In certain markets, Cable has an all-fiber network to the home or business.  These fiber-rich networks offer substantial bandwidth capacity and, through the use of DOCSIS 3.0 and next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology, enable Cable to offer robust broadband and voice services as well as traditional and two-way video services.  All Cable markets are connected to TDS Telecom’s core network. This allows Cable to leverage existing internet connectivity, voice services, and support systems, which enhances reliability and redundancy and builds greater dependability as a service provider.

Competition
The strategy of the Cable segment is focused on broadband to capitalize on the data needs of consumers. Cable seeks to be the leading provider of broadband and video services in its targeted markets.  From a broadband perspective, Cable competes against the incumbent local telephone providers which primarily offer DSL-based services.  Cable offers a superior, higher bandwidth data product using its DOCSIS technology.  Video competition is primarily from satellite providers, and on a limited basis, telephone companies that offer video services and compete for broadband and voice customers.  Other telecommunications providers, including internet-based VoIP providers and wireless providers may compete directly for both residential and commercial voice and broadband service customers.  Changes in consumer behavior or new technologies or both could cause consumers to reduce or cancel their cable video services and instead seek to obtain video on demand over the internet or through new technologies.  Cable systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises; therefore, competing cable systems may be built in the same area.
TDS — REGULATION
TDS’ operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation.  Key regulatory considerations are discussed below.
U.S. Cellular
TDS provides various wireless services, including voice and data services, pursuant to licenses granted by the FCC.  The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act).  The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications.  However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act.
Wireless licenses segmented by geographic areas are granted by the FCC.  The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system, requires prior FCC approval.  The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless licenses is in the public interest.  Wireless licenses are granted generally for a ten year term or, in some cases, for a twelve or fifteen year term.  The FCC establishes the standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications.  All of U.S. Cellular’s licenses for which it applied for renewal since 1995 have been renewed.  U.S. Cellular expects to continue to meet the criteria of the FCC’s license renewal process.
As part of its data services, U.S. Cellular provides internet access.  Such internet access services may be subject to different regulatory requirements than other wireless services.
Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, including billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning, land use, privacy, data security and consumer protection.  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae.
Wireline
The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over all facilities of, and services offered by, TDS Telecom’s ILECs as telecommunications common carriers, to the extent they provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications.  State public utility commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications facilities and services.  In addition, the Wireline business is subject to various other state and local laws, including laws relating to privacy, data security and consumer protection.
The Communications Act requires, among other things, that telecommunications common carriers offer interstate services when requested at just and reasonable rates at terms and conditions that are non-discriminatory.  Maximum rates for regulated interstate services are prescribed by the FCC.  In many states, local rates paid by end user customers and intrastate access charges paid by carriers continue to be subject to state commission approval.
TDS Telecom’s CLEC operations are subject to similar but reduced regulation compared to ILECs.
In addition to traditional circuit-switched voice service that is fully regulated as a telecommunications common carrier service, TDS Telecom also provides interconnected VoIP, which is currently subject to less regulation.
Cable
As a cable multiple systems operator (MSO), Cable is subject to regulation by the FCC, covering matters such as technical operations, administrative requirements, consumer protection, access by people with disabilities, customer privacy and content.  The operation of cable systems requires the MSO to obtain franchises from state or local governmental authorities to occupy public rights of way with network facilities.  These franchises typically are nonexclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations, and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a standard percentage of revenues.
TDS’ Cable operations also provide interconnected VoIP and broadband services, including internet access.  The interconnected VoIP and internet regulatory matters and issues described above under “Wireline” are substantially similar for cable providers.
