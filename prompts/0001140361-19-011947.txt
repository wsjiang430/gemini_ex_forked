--------+---------

General
 We are a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket non-discretionary replacement parts and diagnostic equipment. 
 Our strategic vision statement is to be The Global Leader for Parts and Solutions that Move Our World Today and Tomorrow.
 Consistent with our vision statement, we have implemented a multi-pronged platform for growth. We continue to focus on expanding our non-discretionary automotive aftermarket hard parts offerings. With an estimated market size of approximately $130 billion for hard parts in North America alone, and a scalable infrastructure, our growth opportunities remain abundant. Our recent heavy-duty rotating electrical acquisition offers additional growth opportunities for us within an estimated $698 million domestic market, complementing our leadership position with an expanding line of hard parts. This expansion includes the addition of turbochargers through an acquisition in July 2016 and brake power boosters introduced in August 2016, as well as wheel hubs in 2013 and an expanding line of brake-related products – including rotors and pads.
 Our premium non-discretionary replacement parts are primarily sold to automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout North America, and to major automobile manufacturers for both their aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs (OES). The current population of light duty vehicles in the U.S. is approximately 275 million, and the average age of these vehicles is approximately 11.7 years. The aged vehicle population remains favorable. Although miles driven fluctuate primarily based on fuel prices, they have been steadily increasing for several years. Demand for replacement parts generally increases with the age of vehicles and miles driven.
 The automotive and light truck parts aftermarket is divided into two markets. The first is the do-it-yourself (DIY) market, which is generally serviced by the large retail chain outlets. Consumers who purchase parts from the DIY channel generally install parts into their vehicles themselves. In most cases, this is a less expensive alternative than having the repair performed by a professional installer. The second is the professional installer market, commonly known as the do-it-for-me (DIFM) market. Traditional warehouse distributors, dealer networks, and commercial divisions of retail chains service this market. Generally, the consumer in this channel is a professional parts installer. Our products are distributed to both the DIY and DIFM markets. The distinction between these two markets has become less defined over the years, as retail outlets leverage their distribution strength and store locations to attract professional customers.
 We also supply aftermarket non-discretionary replacement parts to the heavy-duty truck, industrial, marine, and agricultural aftermarket, which has some overlap with the automotive aftermarket as discussed above, but also has specialty distribution channels through OES, fleet, and auto-electric outlets.
 Our position within the diagnostic testing market is particularly exciting. We have expanded our diagnostic equipment applications for combustion engine vehicles, including bench top testers for alternators and starters, and now offer diagnostic technology solutions for the pre- and post-production of electric vehicles, as well as software emulation of power systems applications for the electrification of all forms of transportation — including automobiles, trucks and the emerging electrification of systems with the aerospace industry. The global automotive component and powertrain testing market represents a multi-billion-dollar market, and solidly establishes our growth for today and the future, as electrification becomes increasingly important around the world.
 Growth Strategies and Key Initiatives
 As noted above, we have a multi-pronged growth strategy: first, we are focused on growing our aftermarket hard parts business in the North American marketplace; second, we are focused on growing our diagnostic business for internal combustion engines on a global basis including original equipment and aftermarket; and third, we are focused on growing our electric vehicle diagnostic business servicing original equipment manufacturers for automotive and aerospace applications on a global basis.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  (CODM), reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understand how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. We have determined through this review process that due to recent acquisitions, our business comprises three separate operating segments. Two of the operating segments meet all of the aggregation criteria, and will thus be aggregated. The remaining operating segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds for individual disclosure. Since this immaterial operating segment meets the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, we have combined our operating segments into a single reportable segment.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We sell our products to the largest automotive chains, including Advance (inclusive of Carquest, Autopart International, and Worldpac), AutoZone, Genuine Parts (NAPA), and OReilly with an aggregate of approximately 25,000 retail outlets. We sell diagnostic equipment via direct sales channels, technical conferences, and trade shows to some of the worlds best OE companies, including JFM Technology. We also sell diagnostic equipment through an online parts store. In addition, our products are sold to OES customers, professional installers, and a diverse group of automotive warehouse distributors. During fiscal 2019, we sold approximately 98% of our products in North America, with less than 2% of our products being sold in Asian and European countries.
 We publish printed and electronic catalogs with part numbers and applications for our products along with a detailed technical glossary and informational database. We believe that we maintain one of the most extensive catalog and product identification systems available to the market.
 We primarily ship our products from our facilities and various third party warehouse distribution centers in North America. We have leased a new 410,000 square foot distribution center in Tijuana, Mexico, to improve our distribution capabilities. 
 Customers: Customer Concentration. While we continually seek to diversify our customer base, we currently derive, and have historically derived, a substantial portion of our sales from a small number of large customers. Sales to our three largest customers in the aggregate represented 83%, 85%, and 84%, and sales to our largest customer, AutoZone, represented 38%, 41%, and 44% of our net sales during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Any meaningful reduction in the level of sales to any of these customers, deterioration of the financial condition of any of these customers or the loss of any of these customers could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Customer Arrangements; Impact on Working Capital. We have various length agreements with our customers. Under these agreements, which in most cases have initial terms of at least four years, we are designated as the exclusive or primary supplier for specified categories of our products. Because of the very competitive nature of the market and the limited number of customers for these products, our customers have sought and obtained price concessions, significant marketing allowances and more favorable delivery and payment terms in consideration for our designation as a customers exclusive or primary supplier. These incentives differ from contract to contract and can include (i) the issuance of a specified amount of credits against receivables in accordance with a schedule set forth in the relevant contract, (ii) support for a particular customers research or marketing efforts provided on a scheduled basis, (iii) discounts granted in connection with each individual shipment of product, and (iv) store expansion or product development support. These contracts typically require that we meet ongoing performance standards. Our contracts with our customers expire at various dates through December 2024.
 While these longer-term agreements strengthen our customer relationships, the increased demand for our products often requires that we increase our inventories and personnel. Customer demands that we purchase and maintain their Remanufactured Core inventory also requires the use of our working capital. The marketing and other allowances we typically grant our customers in connection with our new or expanded customer relationships adversely impact near-term revenues, profitability and associated cash flows from these arrangements. However, we believe the investment we make in these new or expanded customer relationships will improve our overall liquidity and cash flow from operations over time.
 Competition
 Our business is highly competitive. We compete with several large and medium sized companies, including BBB Industries, Cardone Industries for hard parts, AVL, Horiba, Siemens, FEV for diagnostic equipment and a

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  large number of smaller regional and specialty companies. We also compete with other overseas manufacturers, particularly those located in China, who are increasing their operations and could become a significant competitive force in the future. 
 We believe that the reputations for quality, reliability, and customer service that a supplier provides are significant factors in our customers purchase decisions. We continuously strive to increase our competitive and technical advantages as the industry and technologies rapidly evolve. Our advanced power emulators are protected by U.S. patents that provide us a strong competitive barrier for a large segment of the market and allow us to be lower cost and more efficient. 
 We believe our ability to educate also helps to distinguish us from many of our competitors. We have created an online library of video courses, aimed at arming our customers as they seek to train the next generation of technicians. We also offer live and web-based training courses via our recently created education facility within our Torrance headquarters. We believe our ability to provide quality replacement automotive parts, rapid and reliable delivery capabilities as well as promotional support also distinguishes us from many of our competitors. In addition, favorable pricing, our core exchange program, and extended payment terms are also very important competitive factors in customers purchase decisions.
 We seek to protect our proprietary processes and other information by relying on trade secret laws and non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees and other persons who have access to that information.
 Operations
 Production Process for Non-discretionary Replacement Parts. The majority of our products are remanufactured at our facilities in Mexico, Malaysia, Canada, and India. We continue to maintain production of certain remanufactured units that require specialized service and/or rapid turnaround in our U.S. facilities. Our remanufacturing process begins with the receipt of Used Cores from our customers or core brokers. The Used Cores are evaluated for inventory control purposes and then sorted by part number. Each Used Core is completely disassembled into its fundamental components. The components are cleaned in an environmentally sound process that employs customized equipment and cleaning materials in accordance with the required specifications of the particular component. All components known to be subject to major wear and those components determined not to be reusable or repairable are replaced by new components. Non-salvageable components of the Used Core are sold as scrap.
 After the cleaning process is complete, the salvageable components of the Used Core are inspected and tested as prescribed by our IATF 16949 and ISO 9001:2015 approved quality programs, which have been implemented throughout the production processes. IATF 16949 and ISO 9001:2015 are internationally recognized, world class, quality programs. Upon passage of all tests, which are monitored by designated quality control personnel, all the component parts are assembled in a work cell into a finished product. Inspection and testing are conducted at multiple stages of the remanufacturing process, and each finished product is inspected and tested on equipment designed to simulate performance under operating conditions. To maximize remanufacturing efficiency, we store component parts ready for assembly in our production facilities. 
 Our remanufacturing processes combine product families with similar configurations into dedicated factory work cells. This remanufacturing process, known as lean manufacturing, eliminated a large number of inventory moves and the need to track inventory movement through the remanufacturing process. This lean manufacturing process has been fully implemented at our existing production facilities and we expect to implement this process at our recently acquired facilities. This manufacturing enables us to significantly reduce the time it takes to produce a finished product. We continue to explore opportunities for improving efficiencies in our remanufacturing process.
 Production Process for Diagnostic Equipment. Our diagnostic systems are primarily engineered and manufactured in Canada. Our facility in Canada is certified under ISO 9001:2015 quality management system, which mandates that we foster continuous improvement to our manufacturing processes. Materials for custom systems are purchased in a just-in-time environment while materials for standard systems are purchased in economic quantities. All materials and components are inspected and tested when required. Certain components require certificates of compliance or test results from our vendors prior to shipping to us. Our manufacturing process combines skilled labor from certified and licensed technicians with raw materials, manufactured

  components, purchased components, and purchased capital components to complete a diagnostic system. All diagnostic systems are inspected and tested per our quality control program, which has been approved by the ISO 9001:2015 quality management system.
 Our facility in New York, U.S., manufactures test systems using purchased electronic and custom components that are primarily assembled at this facility. While some circuit card assemblies are handled by outside subcontractors, most of the assemblies are manufactured in-house along with the fabrication of electronic subassemblies. Quality control and testing is completed on these subassemblies prior to their final installation into the overall equipment rack that includes mechanical, electrical and plumbing operations. Final inspection and acceptance testing are performed to predefined procedures prior to the equipment being packaged in a crate for shipment.
 Used Cores. The majority of our Used Cores are obtained from customers through the core exchange program. To supplement Used Cores received from our customers we purchase Used Cores from core brokers. Although this is not a primary source of Used Cores, it is a critical source for meeting our raw material demands. Remanufacturing consumes, on average, more than one Used Core for each remanufactured unit produced since not all Used Cores are reusable. The yield rates depend upon both the product and customer specifications. 
 We recycle materials, including metal from the Used Cores and corrugated packaging, in keeping with our focus of positively impacting the environment. 
 Purchased Finished Goods. In addition to our remanufactured goods, we also purchase finished goods from various suppliers, including several located in Asia. We perform supplier qualification, product inspection and testing according to our IATF 16949 or ISO 9001:2015 certified quality systems to assure product quality levels. We also perform periodic site audits of our suppliers manufacturing facilities. 
Employees
 We employed 3,868 full-time global employees as of March 31, 2019. We use independent contractors and temporary employees to supplement our workforce as needed. A union represents 2,872 of the employees at our Mexico facilities. All other employees are non-union. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 
Governmental Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to various regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our businesses, operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Potentially significant expenditures, however, could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
Access to Public Information
 We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available free of charge to the public over the Internet at the SECs website at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available free of charge on our website www.motorcarparts.com. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing.
