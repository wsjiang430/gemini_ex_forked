ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K presents information for Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”).  The terms “Holdings,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “our company” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries, and “Sirius XM” refers to our wholly-owned subsidiary Sirius XM Radio Inc. 
Sirius XM Holdings Inc.
Holdings was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 21, 2013.  Holdings has no operations independent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sirius XM.
Relationship with Liberty Media
As of December 31, 2018, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 73% of the outstanding shares of Holdings’ common stock.  Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.
Sirius XM Radio Inc.
Sirius XM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.  We transmit music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through our two proprietary satellite radio systems. We also transmit a larger set of music and other channels and video programming through our streaming service. Our streaming service is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.  We also provide connected vehicle services. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 34.0 million subscribers.  Our subscribers include:

• | subscribers under our regular and discounted pricing plans;


• | subscribers that have prepaid, including payments made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle;


• | subscribers to our streaming services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and


• | certain subscribers to our weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions.

Our primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans.  We offer discounts for prepaid subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount.  We also derive revenue from certain fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services, such as our weather, traffic and data services. We provide traffic services to approximately 8.6 million vehicles.
Our satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers; our website; and retailers.  We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles, through which we acquire the majority of our subscribers.  We also acquire subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously-owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to our services. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies.
Programming
We offer a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, and news, including:

• | an extensive selection of music genres, ranging from rock, pop and hip-hop to country, dance, jazz, Latin and classical;


• | live play-by-play sports from major leagues and colleges;

2


• | a multitude of talk and entertainment channels for a variety of audiences;


• | a wide range of national, international and financial news; and


• | exclusive limited run channels.

Our diverse programming, including our lineup of exclusive content, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers.  We make changes to our programming lineup from time to time as we strive to attract new subscribers and offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to our existing subscribers.  The channel lineups for our services are available at siriusxm.com.
Streaming Service
We stream select music and non-music channels over the Internet.  Our streaming service includes channels that are not available on our satellite radio service.  Access to our streaming service is currently offered to subscribers for a fee.  We also offer applications to allow consumers to access our streaming service on smartphones, tablets, computers, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.
SiriusXM Internet Radio offers listeners enhanced programming discovery and the ability to connect with content currently playing across our commercial-free music, sports, comedy, news, talk and entertainment channels or available through SiriusXM On Demand. SiriusXM On Demand offers our streaming subscribers the ability to choose their favorite episodes from a catalog of content whenever they want. 
In 2018, we launched a new platform and redesigned our mobile app to deliver an enhanced streaming experience. That experience includes expanded programming, greater discovery, more intuitive recommendations, the introduction of video programming and other features designed to increase consumer engagement with our streaming product. Our internet-based video offering currently features Howard Stern, arranged and presented in an easy-to-view manner, with highlights from Howard Stern’s interviews with celebrity guests, musical performances in the Howard Stern studio, show clips, and show specials.  We expect to expand our video offering in 2019 with, among other items, live segments of Howard Stern's show and video generated by our other hosts and guests.
360L
In 2018, we introduced a user interface, which we call “360L,” that combines our satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience. Our 360L interface has been deployed in Dodge Ram trucks and is in the process of being introduced by several other automakers. 360L allows us to take advantage of advanced in-dash infotainment systems.  360L is intended to leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage of our satellite infrastructure and low delivery costs with the two-way communication capability of a wireless streaming service to provide consumers seamless access to our content, including our live channels, on demand service and even more personalized music services.  The wireless streaming connection included in 360L enables enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of our content in the vehicle easier.  360L also allows consumers to manage aspects of their subscriptions directly through their vehicles’ equipment and provides us important data to better enable us to understand how our subscribers use our service and how we can more effectively market our service to consumers.
Distribution of Radios
Automakers
We distribute satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles.  We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles.  Satellite radios are available as a factory or dealer-installed option in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States.
Most automakers include a subscription to our service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles.  In certain cases, we receive subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of our service.  We share with certain automakers a portion of the revenues we derive from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive our service.  We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses.
3

Previously Owned Vehicles
We acquire subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios.  We have entered into agreements with many automakers to market subscriptions to purchasers and lessees of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs.  We also work directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified used vehicles.
We have developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and have established marketing plans to promote our services to these potential subscribers.
Retail
We sell satellite radios directly to consumers through our website.  Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national, regional and internet retailers, such as amazon.com.
Our Satellite Radio Systems
Our satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas of the continental United States despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions.  We continually monitor our infrastructure and regularly evaluate improvements in technology.
Our satellite radio systems have three principal components:

• | satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities;


• | studios; and


• | radios.

Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities
Satellites.  We provide our service through a fleet of five orbiting geostationary satellites, two in the Sirius system, FM-5 and FM-6, and three in the XM system, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5.  Our XM-5 satellite serves as a spare for both the XM and Sirius systems.
We have entered into agreements for the design, construction and launch of two new satellites, SXM-7 and SXM-8, which we plan to launch into geostationary orbits in 2019 and 2020, respectively, as replacements for XM-3 and XM-4.
Satellite Insurance.  We have procured insurance for SXM-7 and SXM-8 to cover the risks associated with each satellite's launch and first year in orbit. We do not have insurance policies covering our in-orbit satellites, as we consider the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.
Terrestrial Repeaters.  In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from our satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected.  In other areas with a high density of next generation wireless systems our service may experience interference. In many of these areas, we have deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement and enhance our signal coverage and, in many other areas, we are planning to deploy additional repeaters to reduce interference.  We operate over 1,000 terrestrial repeaters across the United States as part of our systems.
Other Satellite Facilities.  We control and communicate with our satellites from facilities in North America. Our satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator.
Studios
Our programming originates from studios in New York City and Washington D.C. and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Los Angeles, Nashville and a variety of venues across the country.  Our corporate headquarters is based in New York City.
Radios
We do not manufacture radios.  We have authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and have licensed our technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain 
4

brands.  We do manage various aspects of the production of satellite radios.  To facilitate the sale of radios, we may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers.
Connected Vehicle Services
We provide connected vehicle services to several automakers and directly to consumers through aftermarket devices. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.  We offer a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicles diagnostics, and stolen or parked vehicle locator services.
In 2017, Sirius XM purchased Automatic Labs Inc. ("Automatic"), a connected vehicle device and mobile application company. Automatic offers a subscription service for consumers and auto dealers. By pairing Automatic's install-it-yourself adapter and mobile application, most vehicles model year 1996 or later can be transformed into connected vehicles. Using the Automatic service, drivers have access to important services, such as crash alerts, roadside assistance, vehicle location monitoring and sharing, vehicle health and performance monitoring, and recall notifications and service reminders. Auto dealers can also employ the Automatic service to, among other things, assist in managing vehicle inventory, monitoring the status of vehicles and delivering notifications and reminders to purchasers and lessees of vehicles. The Automatic adapter collects detailed information about each vehicle's geolocation, use, operation, performance and maintenance status in order to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Automatic service.
Subscribers to our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
Other Services
Commercial Accounts.  Our programming is available for commercial establishments.  Commercial subscription accounts are available through providers of in-store entertainment solutions and directly from us.
Satellite Television Service.  Certain of our music channels are offered as part of select programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service.
Travel Link.  We offer Travel Link, a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings.
Real-Time Traffic Services.  We offer services that provide graphic information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible in-vehicle navigation systems.
Real-Time Weather Services.  We offer several real-time weather services designed for improving situational awareness in vehicles, boats and planes.
Commercial subscribers are included in our subscriber count, and subscribers to the DISH Network satellite television service are not included in our subscriber count. Subscribers to our Travel Link, real-time traffic services and real-time weather services are not included in our subscriber count, unless the applicable service is purchased by the subscriber separately and not as part of a radio subscription to our service.
Sirius XM Canada
Sirius XM holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. (“Sirius XM Canada”), with the remainder of Sirius XM Canada's voting and equity interests held by two shareholders.
Sirius XM has entered into a Services Agreement and an Advisory Services Agreement with Sirius XM Canada. Each agreement has a thirty year term. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada pays Sirius XM 25% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis through December 31, 2021 and 30% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis thereafter. Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada pays Sirius XM 5% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis.
As of December 31, 2018, Sirius XM Canada had approximately 2.6 million subscribers. Sirius XM Canada's subscribers are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.

Pandora Media, Inc.
In 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire Pandora Media, Inc. ("Pandora"), in which Sirius XM had previously made an investment in 2017. Pandora operates an internet-based music discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for listeners. As of December 31, 2018, Sirius XM's investment in Pandora represented an approximately 18% interest in Pandora's outstanding common stock, and an approximately 15% interest on an as-converted basis. A description of Sirius XM's existing investment in Pandora and our agreement to acquire Pandora is set forth below.
About our Existing Pandora Investment
Pursuant to an Investment Agreement with Pandora, in 2017, Sirius XM purchased 480,000 shares of Pandora’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $480 million.
The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into Pandora common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Pandora Common Stock"), at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share of Pandora Common Stock and an initial conversion rate of 95.2381 shares of Pandora Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 6.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, if and when declared. Any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock may be settled by Pandora, at its option, in shares of Pandora Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof. However, unless and until Pandora’s stockholders have approved the issuance of greater than 19.99% of the outstanding Pandora Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock may not be converted into more than 19.99% of Pandora’s outstanding Pandora Common Stock as of June 9, 2017.
The investment includes a mandatory redemption feature on any date from and after September 22, 2022 whereby Sirius XM, at its option, may require Pandora to purchase the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends for, at the election of Pandora, cash, shares of Pandora Common Stock or a combination thereof.
We have appointed James E. Meyer, our Chief Executive Officer, David J. Frear, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Gregory B. Maffei, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, to Pandora's Board of Directors pursuant to our designation rights under the Investment Agreement. Mr. Maffei also serves as the Chairman of Pandora's Board of Directors.
Our right to designate directors will fall away once we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 50% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement. Following the earlier to occur of (i) September 22, 2019 and (ii) the date on which we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock that were issued upon conversion thereof equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 75% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement, we have the right to designate only two directors. 
We are entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of Pandora Common Stock on an as-converted basis (up to a maximum of 19.99% of the Pandora Common Stock outstanding on June 9, 2017, unless stockholder approval has been received). We are also entitled to a separate class vote with respect to certain amendments to Pandora’s organizational documents, issuances by Pandora of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock and the incurrence of certain indebtedness by Pandora. 
Upon certain change of control events involving Pandora, Pandora is required to repurchase all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the greater of (1) an amount in cash equal to 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends through June 9, 2022 (assuming such shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding through such date) and (2) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Pandora Common Stock immediately prior to the change of control event (disregarding the 19.99% cap). 
Beginning on September 22, 2020, if the volume weighted average price per share of Pandora Common Stock exceeds $18.375, as may be adjusted, for at least 20 trading days in any period of 30 consecutive trading days, Pandora may redeem all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends for, at the election of Pandora, cash, shares of Pandora Common Stock or a combination thereof, provided 
6

that, unless stockholder approval has been received, Pandora may not settle the redemption for shares of Pandora Common Stock to the extent the 19.99% cap would be exceeded.
 Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into with Pandora, we have certain customary registration rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof.
Agreement to Acquire Pandora
On September 23, 2018, Holdings entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Holdings, Pandora, Billboard Holding Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pandora, Billboard Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Billboard Holding Company, Inc., Sirius XM and White Oaks Acquisition Corp., pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Holdings agreed to acquire Pandora (such transaction, the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of Pandora Common Stock, will be converted into the right to receive 1.44 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Holdings common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Holdings Common Stock”). In connection with the Merger, the Series A Preferred Stock will be canceled for no consideration.
Further, pursuant to the Merger:


• | each option granted by Pandora under its stock incentive plans to purchase shares of Pandora Common Stock, whether vested or unvested will be assumed and converted into an option to purchase shares of Holdings Common Stock, with appropriate adjustments (based on the Exchange Ratio) to the exercise price and number of shares of Holdings Common Stock subject to such option, and will have the same vesting schedule and exercise conditions as in effect as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger;


• | each unvested restricted stock unit granted by Pandora under its stock incentive plans will be assumed and converted into an unvested restricted stock unit of Holdings, with appropriate adjustments (based on the Exchange Ratio) to the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock to be received, and will have the same vesting schedule and settlement date as in effect as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger; and


• | each unvested performance award granted by Pandora under its stock incentive plans shall be canceled and forfeited if the per share value of merger consideration at the closing of the transactions as determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement is less than $20.00, and otherwise each such award will be assumed and converted into a time vesting award to receive a number of shares of Holdings Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio, and will have the same vesting schedule as in effect as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both Holdings and Pandora, and each party has agreed to customary covenants, including covenants relating to the conduct of Holdings’ and Pandora’s businesses during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. In the case of Pandora, such obligations include its agreement to call a meeting of its stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement, and, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that its stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Pandora stockholders voted to adopt the Merger Agreement at a special stockholder meeting on January 29, 2019. 
The completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, among others, the absence of any law or order that prohibits or makes illegal the Merger and, subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party and compliance by the parties with their respective covenants.
It is intended that the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for Federal income tax purposes. However, if either Pandora or Holdings are unable to receive an opinion of counsel to that effect, the parties have agreed to restructure the Merger so that the Merger will be treated as a taxable stock sale.
Competition
Satellite Radio
We face significant competition for both listeners and advertisers in our satellite radio business, including from providers of radio and other audio services.
7

Traditional AM/FM Radio.  Our services compete with traditional AM/FM radio.  Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees.  Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports.  The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio may reduce the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for our subscription services and, by offering free broadcasts, it may impose limits on what we can charge for our services. Several traditional radio companies own large numbers of radio stations or other media properties.
Internet-Based Competitors.  Internet radio services often have no geographic limitations and provide listeners with radio programming from across the country and around the world.  Major online providers make high fidelity digital streams available through the Internet for free or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription.  Certain of these services include advanced functionality, such as personalization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content.  For some consumers, these services may compete with our services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. 
Advanced In-Dash Infotainment Systems.  Nearly all automakers have deployed integrated multimedia systems in their vehicles, including in many cases Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, Internet radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications.  Internet radio and other data are typically connected to the system through an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition.  These systems may enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in vehicles.
Direct Broadcast Satellite and Cable Audio.  A number of providers offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems.  These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home.  The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service.
Other Digital Media Services.  The audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with our services now or that could compete with those services in the future.
Traffic Services
A number of providers compete with our traffic services.  In-dash navigation is threatened by smartphones that provide data services through a direct vehicle interface.  Most of these smartphones offer GPS mapping with sophisticated data-based turn-by-turn navigation.
Connected Vehicle Services
Our connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers, including Verizon Telematics as well as products being developed by automakers for their vehicles.  OnStar, a division of General Motors, also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles.  We also compete with wireless devices such as mobile phones.  We compete against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the basis of innovation, service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and systems customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.
Government Regulation
As operators of a privately-owned satellite system, we are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:

• | the licensing of our satellite systems;


• | preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and


• | compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services.

Any assignment or transfer of control of our FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC.  The FCC's order approving the merger of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, with and into XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 requires us to comply with certain voluntary commitments we made as part of the FCC merger proceeding.  We believe we comply with those commitments.
8

In 1997, we were the winning bidders for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services.  Our FCC licenses for our Sirius satellites expire in 2022 and 2025.  Our FCC licenses for our XM satellites expire in 2021, 2022 and 2026.  The FCC has also granted us licenses to construct, deploy and operate SXM-7 and SXM-8 as replacement satellites. We anticipate that, absent significant misconduct on our part, the FCC will renew our licenses to permit operation of our satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites.
In some areas, we have installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement our satellite signal coverage.  The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted us a license through 2027 to operate our repeater network.
In certain cases, we obtain FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators.  We believe our radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules.
We are required to obtain export licenses or other approvals from the United States government to export certain equipment, services and technical data related to our satellites and their operations.  The transfer of such equipment, services and technical data outside the United States or to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China).
Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting our services could adversely affect our ability to retain our FCC licenses or the manner in which we operate.
Copyrights to Programming
In connection with our music programming, we must negotiate and enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders:  holders of copyrights in musical works (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of copyrights in sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work).
Musical Works
Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”) and SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”).  The market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”), have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders.  We have arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and GMR, and are in negotiations with BMI for a new agreement. If we are unable to reach an agreement with BMI, a court will determine the royalty we will be required to pay BMI.  The changing market for musical works may have an adverse effect on us, including increasing our costs or limiting the musical works available to us.
Sound Recordings
Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, Inc., an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists.  We may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings, or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the Copyright Royalty Board (the “CRB”) of the Library of Congress.
In December 2017, the CRB issued its determination regarding the royalty rate payable by us under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over our satellite radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period starting January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2022. Under the terms of the CRB’s decision, we are required to pay a royalty of 15.5% of gross revenues, subject to exclusions and adjustments.
The rates and terms contained in the CRB’s December 2017 determination permit us to reduce the payment due each month by the percentage of our transmissions of recordings that are directly licensed from copyright owners and the percentage of transmissions that comprise recordings fixed before February 15, 1972 that we have licensed. The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from our U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers, and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings. Exclusions from revenue subject to the statutory license fee include, among other things: 
9


• | monies or other consideration attributable to the sale and/or license of equipment and/or other technology, including but not limited to bandwidth, sales of devices that receive our satellite radio services and any shipping and handling fees therefor;


• | royalties paid to us for intellectual property rights;


• | sales and use taxes;


• | credit card, invoice, activation, swap and early termination fees charged to subscribers and reasonably related to the expenses to which they pertain;


• | bad debt expense; and


• | revenues attributable to our current and future: data services offered for a separate charge (such as weather, traffic, destination information, messaging, sports scores, stock ticker information, extended program associated data, video and photographic images, and such other telematics and/or data services as may exist from time to time); channels, programming, products and/or other services offered for a separate charge where such channels use only incidental performances of sound recordings; channels, programming, products and/or other services provided outside of the United States; and channels, programming, products and/or other services for which the performance of the recordings is exempt from any license requirement or is separately licensed, including by a statutory license.

In 2018, the Copyright Act was amended by The Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (the “Music Modernization Act”). Under the Music Modernization Act, the use of sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972 is now subject to a royalty at the existing rate set by the CRB; the existing sound recording royalty rate was extended for five years, through December 31, 2027; and the law foreclosed our ability to appeal the December 2017 determination of the CRB. Sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 were previously governed by state law. During 2015 and 2016, we settled suits with copyright owners for almost all of the pre-1972 sound recordings we use and entered into direct licenses for their use.
The licensing of sound recordings for use on the Internet is also subject to the United States Copyright Act on terms established by the CRB.  In 2018, we paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings on the Internet of $0.0023.  In accordance with the CRB’s decision, this royalty rate may increase through 2020 based on changes in the consumer price index.
Trademarks
We have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” and “SXM” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services we offer. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use the “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” or “SXM” trademarks in the United States.  We also have registered, and intend to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of our channels.  We have also registered the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM” and “SiriusXM” in Canada. We have granted a license to use certain of our trademarks in Canada to Sirius XM Canada.
Personnel
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,699 full-time employees.  In addition, we rely upon a number of part-time employees, consultants, other advisors and outsourced relationships. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
