Trends
Many organizations are facing complex, dated, and mostly disparate environments in their legacy customer engagement operations that make it challenging to deliver on the promise of an exceptional customer experience. Faced with higher customer expectations and the need for market differentiation, organizations view customer engagement and elevating the customer experience as essential to their future success. To elevate customer experience, many organizations are faced with the need to grow their workforce and find the resulting increase in operating cost unsustainable. As a result, they are looking to invest in new customer engagement technologies that can elevate the customer experience, while reducing operating cost. We believe the following trends are driving growth in our market as organizations seek to:

• | Reduce Complexity and Become More Agile to Adapt Faster. Many organizations have complex environments that were assembled over many years with multiple legacy systems from many different vendors deployed in silos across the enterprise. To reduce complexity and simplify operations, these organizations are looking for new solutions that are open and flexible and make it easier to address evolving requirements, while protecting their legacy investments. Organizations are also seeking open platforms that address their customer engagement needs across many enterprise functions, including the contact center, back-office and branch operations, self-service, ecommerce, customer experience, marketing, IT, and compliance.


• | Modernize Customer Engagement IT Architectures. Many organizations are looking to modernize their legacy customer engagement operations by transitioning to the cloud, adopting modern architectures that facilitate the orchestration of disparate systems and the sharing of data across enterprise functions. Organizations which are at different stages of migrating to the cloud and other modernization initiatives are also looking for vendors that can help them evolve customer engagement at their own pace with minimal disruption to their operations.


• | Automate Customer Engagement Operations. Many organizations are seeking solutions that incorporate artificial intelligence and analytics to reduce manual work and increase workforce efficiency through automation. They also seek to empower their customers with self-service backed by AI-powered bots, and human/bot collaboration, to elevate the customer experience in a fast, personalized way.

We believe that security organizations face new kinds of sophisticated threats that are increasingly complex, and they seek to deploy data mining solutions that are powered by predictive intelligence and incorporate a higher level of automation using artificial intelligence and other advanced analytic technologies. Our significant experience serving leading security agencies around the world provides us with a unique perspective on our customers’ evolving needs and allows us to respond quickly to new market trends. 
Verint’s growth strategy is to expand our portfolio to address market trends and to offer our solutions directly and through partners to our growing installed base and to new customers globally. 
Trends
We believe that the following trends are driving demand for security and intelligence data mining software:

• | Security Threats Becoming Increasingly Pervasive and Complex. Governments, critical infrastructure providers, and enterprises face many types of security threats from criminal and terrorist organizations and foreign governments. Some of these security threats come from well-organized and well-funded organizations that utilize new and increasingly sophisticated methods. As a result, security and intelligence organizations find it more difficult and complicated to detect, investigate and neutralize threats. Many of these organizations are seeking to deploy more advanced data mining solutions that can help them capture and analyze data from multiple sources to effectively and efficiently address the challenge of increased sophistication and complexity.


• | Shortage of Security Analysts Increasing the Need for Automation. Security organizations are using data mining solutions to help conduct investigations and generate actionable insights. Typically, data mining solutions require security organizations to employ intelligence analysts and data scientists to operate them. However, there is a shortage of such qualified personnel globally leading to elongated investigations and increased risk that security threats go undetected or are not addressed. To overcome this challenge, many security organizations are seeking advanced data mining solutions that automate functions historically performed manually to improve the quality and speed of investigations and intelligence production. These organizations are also increasingly seeking artificial intelligence and other advanced data analysis tools to gain intelligence faster with fewer analysts and data scientists.


• | Need for Predictive Intelligence as a Force Multiplier. Predictive intelligence is generated by correlating massive amounts of data from a wide range of disparate sources to uncover previously unknown connections, identify suspicious behaviors using advanced analytics, and predict future events. Predictive intelligence is a force multiplier, enabling security organizations to allocate resources more effectively to prioritize various operational tasks based on actionable intelligence. Security organizations are seeking advanced data mining solutions that can generate accurate and actionable predictive intelligence to shorten investigation times and empower their teams with greater insights.

Our Strategy

We believe we are well positioned to address these market trends. The key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Addressing the Increased Complexity of Security Threats with Advanced Data Mining Software, Proven Intelligence Methodologies and Deep Domain Expertise. Verint has a long history of working closely with leading security organizations around the world and has designed its data mining software portfolio based on a thorough understanding of our customers’ needs, proven intelligence methodologies and deep domain expertise. We believe this experience positions us well to expand existing customer relationships, win new customers, and continue to grow our data mining software portfolio to address evolving and more complex security needs.


• | Leveraging Automation Technologies to Reduce Dependency on Security Analysts and Data Scientists. Security analysts and data scientists are critical to conducting security investigations in an environment of growing complexity. However, given a shortage of these skilled resources, it is important to reduce the dependency on them by automating tedious and repetitive functions that previously required manual operation. Our strategy is to increase the use of automation and artificial intelligence technologies across our portfolio and introduce advanced data mining software that can further automate the intelligence and investigative processes for our customers, while reducing dependency on large numbers of intelligence analysts and data scientists.


• | Improving the Effectiveness of Security Organizations with Predictive Intelligence Capabilities. Our data mining software portfolio provides our customers the capability to capture and analyze data and to generate predictive intelligence. Our strategy is to further enhance our software to empower security organizations with more accurate

In the year ended January 31, 2019, we derived approximately 65% and 35% of our revenue from the sale of our Customer Engagement and Cyber Intelligence solutions, respectively. We are party to contracts with customers in both of our segments, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the segment.
In the year ended January 31, 2019, we derived approximately 54%, 26%, and 20% of our revenue from sales to end users in the Americas, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, respectively. See also Note 16, “Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information” to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report for additional information and financial data about each of our operating segments and geographic regions.
For the year ended January 31, 2019, approximately one third of our business was generated from contracts with various governments around the world, including local, regional, and national government agencies. Due to the unique nature of the terms and conditions associated with government contracts generally, our government contracts may be subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the government customer. Some of our customer engagements require us to have security credentials or to participate in projects through an approved legal entity.
Seasonality and Cyclicality 
As is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, potentially by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, also have an impact on our business and financial results. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of factors which may affect our business and financial results.
Research and Development 
We continue to enhance the features and performance of our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions through extensive R&D activities. In addition to the development of new solutions and the addition of capabilities to existing solutions, our R&D activities include quality assurance and advanced technical support for our customer services organization. In certain instances, primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment, we may tailor our products to meet the particular requirements of our 
11

customers. R&D is performed primarily in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Indonesia for our Customer Engagement segment; and in Israel, Germany, Brazil, Cyprus, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Romania, and Bulgaria for our Cyber Intelligence segment.
To support our research and development efforts, we make significant investments in R&D every year. We allocate our R&D resources in response to market research and customer demand for additional features and solutions. Our development strategy involves rolling out initial releases of our products and adding features over time. We incorporate product feedback received from our customers into our product development process. While the majority of our products are developed internally, in some cases, we also acquire or license technologies, products, and applications from third parties based on timing and cost considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—For certain products, components, or services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, and if these relationships are disrupted, lost, or must be terminated, we may not be able to obtain substitutes or may face other difficulties” under Item 1A of this report.
As noted above, a significant portion of our R&D operations is located outside the United States. We have derived benefits from participation in certain government-sponsored programs, including those of the Israel Innovation Authority (“IIA”), formerly the Office of the Chief Scientist (“OCS”), and in other jurisdictions for the support of R&D activities conducted in those locations. In the case of Israel, the Israeli law under which our IIA grants are made limits our ability to manufacture products, or transfer technologies, developed using these grants outside of Israel without permission from the IIA. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—Because we have significant foreign operations and business, we are subject to geopolitical and other risks that could materially adversely affect our results” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—Conditions in and our relationship to Israel may materially adversely affect our operations and personnel and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or engage in certain transactions” under Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risks associated with our foreign operations.
Manufacturing, Suppliers, and Service Providers 
While our primary focus is on developing and producing software, to accommodate customers’ desire for turnkey solutions, we also deliver solutions that incorporate third-party hardware components. This applies mainly to our Cyber Intelligence segment, as the majority of the solutions from our Customer Engagement segment are comprised of software and do not incorporate hardware components. We utilize both unaffiliated manufacturing subcontractors, as well as our internal operations, to produce, assemble, and deliver solutions incorporating hardware components. These internal operations consist primarily of installing our software on externally purchased hardware components, final assembly, repair, and testing, which involves the application of extensive quality control procedures to materials, components, subassemblies, and systems. We also perform system integration functions prior to shipping turnkey solutions to our customers. Our internal operations are performed primarily in our German, Israeli, U.S. and Cypriot facilities for solutions in our Cyber Intelligence segment, and in our U.S. facility for certain solutions in our Customer Engagement segment. Although we have occasionally experienced delays and shortages in the supply of proprietary components in the past, we have typically been able to obtain adequate supplies of all material components in a timely manner from alternative sources, when necessary. We also rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers. We deploy our cloud solutions on third-party cloud computing and hosting platforms. We provide our customers with service level commitments with respect to uptime and accessibility for these hosted offerings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—For certain products, components, or services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, and if these relationships are disrupted, lost, or must be terminated, we may not be able to obtain substitutes or may face other difficulties” under Item 1A of this report for a discussion of risks associated with our manufacturing operations and suppliers. 
Employees 
As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 6,100 professionals, including certain contractors, with approximately 41%, 25%, 23%, and 11% of our employees and contractors located in the Americas, Israel, EMEA (excluding Israel), and APAC, respectively.
We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. Our employees in the United States are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. In some cases, our employees outside the United States are automatically subject to certain protections negotiated by organized labor in those countries directly with the government or trade unions, or are automatically entitled to severance or other benefits mandated under local laws. For example, while we are not a party to any collective bargaining or other agreement with any labor organization in Israel, certain provisions of the 
12

collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Laborers in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel) are applicable to our Israeli employees by virtue of expansion orders of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor.
Intellectual Property Rights 
General
Our success depends to a significant degree on the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Patents
As of January 31, 2019, we had nearly 1,000 patents and patent applications worldwide, including more than 120 patent issuances or allowances during the past year. We regularly review new areas of technology related to our businesses to determine whether they can and should be patented.
Licenses
Our customer and partner license agreements prohibit the unauthorized use, copying, and disclosure of our software technology and contain customer restrictions and confidentiality terms. These agreements generally warrant that the software and proprietary hardware will materially comply with written documentation and assert that we own or have sufficient rights in the software we distribute and have not violated the intellectual property rights of others.
We license our products in a format that does not permit users to change the software code. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—For certain products, components, or services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, and if these relationships are disrupted, lost, or must be terminated, we may not be able to obtain substitutes or may face other difficulties” under Item 1A of this report.
While we employ many of our innovations exclusively in our own products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based on industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We use various trademarks and service marks to protect the marks used in our business. We also claim common law protections for other marks we use in our business. Competitors and other companies could adopt similar marks or try to prevent us from using our marks, consequently impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Information/Product Security and Intellectual Property—Our intellectual property may not be adequately protected” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion regarding the risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property.
Competition 
We face strong competition in all of our markets, and we expect that competition will persist and intensify.
In our Customer Engagement segment, our competitors include Aspect Software, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications, Medallia Inc., NICE Systems Ltd., Nuance Communications, Inc., Pegasystems Inc., divisions of larger companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP, and Salesforce.com, Inc., as well as many smaller companies, which can vary across regions. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, our competitors include BAE Systems plc, Elbit Systems Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Genetec Inc., IBM Corporation, JSI Telecom, Palantir Technologies, Inc., and Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co., KG, as well as a number of smaller companies and divisions of larger companies that compete with us in certain regions or only with respect to portions of our product portfolio. 
In each of our operating segments, we believe that we compete principally on the basis of:
13


• | Product performance and functionality;


• | Product quality and reliability;


• | Breadth of product portfolio and pre-defined integrations;


• | Global presence, reputation, and high-quality customer service and support;


• | Specific domain expertise, industry knowledge, vision, and experience; and


• | Price.

We believe that our competitive success depends primarily on our ability to provide technologically advanced and cost-effective solutions and services. Some of our competitors have superior brand recognition and significantly greater financial or other resources than we do. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets or we enter theirs, and as new products, services, technologies, and delivery methods are introduced. In addition, consolidation is common in our markets and has in the past and may in the future improve the position of our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—Intense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the competitive risks we face.
Export Regulations 
We and our subsidiaries are subject to applicable export control regulations in countries from which we export goods and services. These controls may apply by virtue of the country in which the products are located or by virtue of the origin of the content contained in the products. If the controls of a particular country apply, the level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, our Cyber Intelligence solutions tend to be more highly controlled than our Customer Engagement solutions. Where controls apply, the export of our products generally requires an export license or authorization or that the transaction qualify for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements.
