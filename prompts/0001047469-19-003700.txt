      ITEM 1.    BUSINESS. 
Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker started Floral City Furniture in 1927, and in 1928 the newly formed company introduced its first recliner. In 1941, we were incorporated in the state of Michigan as La-Z-Boy Chair Company, and in 1996 we changed our name to La-Z-Boy Incorporated. Today, our La-Z-Boy brand is one of the most recognized brands in the furniture industry. 
 We are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States. The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States. We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products under the La-Z-Boy®, England, Kincaid®, and Joybird® tradenames. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products under the Kincaid®, American Drew®, Hammary®, and Joybird® tradenames. We have seven major manufacturing locations and six regional distribution centers in the United States and two facilities in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy. We operate a wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We also participate in two joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses: one that operates a manufacturing facility and another that operates a wholesale sales office. We operate a global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities. We also have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure-import model for casegoods. 
 We sell our products to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 60 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, directly to consumers through stores that we own and operate and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 353 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores and 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be "proprietary." We own 156 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores. The remainder of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, as well as all 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, are independently owned and operated. La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. In total, we have approximately 7.8 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in North America. We also have approximately 2.7 million square feet of floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with approximately half of Hammary's sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network. Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 590 outlets and approximately 1.9 million square feet of floor space. In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.4 million square feet worldwide. Joybird, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, sells product almost exclusively online and has a limited amount of proprietary retail floor space used as a showroom to develop its brand. 
 Principal Products and Industry Segments 
 Our reportable operating segments are the Upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment and the Retail segment. 
 4

    Upholstery Segment.    Our Upholstery reportable segment is our largest business segment and consists primarily of two operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, and the operating segment for our England subsidiary. The Upholstery segment also includes our international wholesale businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and because they meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Upholstery segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Upholstery segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. 
  Casegoods Segment.    Our Casegoods segment consists of one operating segment that sells furniture under three brands: American Drew®, Hammary®, and Kincaid®. The Casegoods segment is an importer, marketer, and distributor of casegoods (wood) furniture such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces, and also manufactures some custom upholstered furniture. The Casegoods segment sells directly to major dealers, as well as La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. 
  Retail Segment.    Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment comprised of our 156 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores. The Retail segment primarily sells upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to the end consumer through these stores. 
  Corporate & Other.    Corporate & Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy® brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures and sells upholstered furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports and sells casegoods (wood) furniture such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to end consumers almost exclusively online through its website, www.joybird.com. None of the operating segments included in Corporate & Other meets the requirements of reportable segments at this time. 
 We have provided additional detailed information regarding our segments and their products in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements and our "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section, both of which are included in this report. 
   Raw Materials and Parts 
 The principal raw materials and parts used for manufacturing are purchased cover (primarily fabrics and leather), polyester batting and polyurethane foam for cushioning and padding, lumber and plywood for frames, steel for motion mechanisms, electrical components for power units and various other metal components for fabrication of product. We purchase about 50% of our polyurethane foam from one supplier, which has several facilities across the United States that deliver to our plants. We purchase cover from a variety of sources, but we rely on a limited number of major suppliers. We purchase approximately half of our cover in a raw state (fabric rolls or leather hides) and cut and sew it into cover, and purchase the remainder in covers that have already been cut and sewn to our specifications by third-party offshore suppliers. We buy cut-and-sewn leather and fabric products from five primary suppliers. Of the products that we import, three suppliers that operate in China manufacture over 95% of the leather cut-and-sewn sets, and three suppliers that also operate in China manufacture approximately 90% of the fabric products. One of the five primary suppliers manufactures both leather cut-and-sewn sets and fabric products. We use these suppliers primarily for their product design capabilities, to leverage our buying power, and to control quality and product flow, in addition to their 
 5

   ability to handle the volume of product we require to operate our business. If any of these suppliers experience financial or other difficulties, we could experience temporary disruptions in our manufacturing process until we obtain alternate suppliers. 
 We manage our Asian supply chain through our global trading company in Hong Kong, which works to identify efficiencies, savings opportunities, and manage the relationship with our Asian suppliers. During fiscal 2019, the prices of materials we use in our upholstery manufacturing process increased during the first half of the year, but then retracted in the back half of the year. For the full fiscal year 2019, changes in raw material prices were flat compared with the prior year. We expect to experience an increase in raw material costs in fiscal 2020 as well as increases in transportation costs. Additionally, we expect that certain raw materials and parts may be subject to higher duties and tariffs in fiscal 2020, including raw materials and parts we import from China. In response to these increases, we may increase our selling prices to our customers or assess a material or duty surcharge during periods when these increased prices or duties are in effect. 
   Finished Goods Imports 
 We import all of the casegoods (wood) furniture that we sell. In fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 55% of this imported product from three suppliers. We use these suppliers primarily to leverage our buying power, to control quality and product flow, and because their capabilities align with our product design needs. In addition, these suppliers have the ability to handle the volume of product we require. If any of these suppliers experience financial or other difficulties, we could experience disruptions in our product flow until we obtain alternate suppliers, which could be lengthy due to the longer lead time required for sourced wood furniture from Asian manufacturers. 
 We use an all-import model for our casegoods furniture primarily to remain competitive for these products. The prices we paid for these imported products, including associated transportation costs, increased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, partially due to an increase in tariffs on certain product imported from China. We import approximately 25% of our casegoods product from China, and currently expect these product costs to increase more in fiscal 2020 than fiscal 2019 if the recent tariff increase to 25% remains in effect throughout fiscal 2020. We are actively working on moving sourcing of products out of China to reduce the tariff impact. Additionally, we are expecting higher ocean freight costs in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. We may increase our selling prices to help offset the expected rise in transportation costs and may assess a material or duty surcharge on products imported from China when these increased prices or duties are in effect. Looking across our business, imported finished goods represented 8% of our consolidated sales in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. 
   Seasonal Business 
 We believe that the demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, housing market conditions and unemployment rates. For our wholesale businesses, the fourth quarter is historically the seasonally highest-volume sales quarter, closely followed by our third quarter. For our retail and e-commerce businesses, which includes our company-owned retail stores and Joybird, the third quarter is typically the seasonally highest-volume sales quarter. 
 During fiscal 2019, however, we experienced our largest sales volume quarter for our wholesale businesses during the third quarter. We believe this experience was reflective of the overall trends in the furniture industry and was not an indicator that our seasonal trends are changing for our wholesale businesses, because in the first calendar quarter of 2019, which roughly aligns to our fiscal fourth quarter, the furniture industry experienced negative growth for the first time since the 2008 recession. 
 We schedule production to maintain consistent manufacturing activity throughout the year whenever possible. During the summer months, the furniture industry typically experiences weaker demand, and as such we typically shut down our domestic plants for one week each fiscal year to perform routine 
 6

   maintenance on our equipment. Accordingly, for our wholesale business, the first quarter is usually the company's weakest in terms of sales and earnings. Also driven by the seasonal slowdown in the summer, our retail business typically experiences its lowest sales in the first quarter. 
   Economic Cycle and Purchasing Cycle 
 Our sales are impacted by the overall growth of the furniture industry, which is primarily influenced by consumer discretionary spending and existing and new housing activity. In addition, consumer confidence, employment rates, international trade policies, and other factors could affect demand. Upholstered furniture has a shorter life cycle than casegoods furniture because upholstered furniture is typically more fashion and design-oriented, and is often purchased one or two pieces at a time. Purchases and demand for consumer goods, including upholstered furniture, fluctuate based on consumer confidence. Casegoods products, in contrast, are longer-lived and frequently purchased in groupings or "suites," resulting in a much larger cost to the consumer. As a result, casegoods sales are more sensitive to economic conditions, including growth or a slowdown in the housing market, whereas upholstered furniture normally exhibits a less-volatile sales pattern over an economic cycle. 
 Practices Regarding Working Capital Items 
 The following describes our significant practices regarding working capital items. 
  Inventory:    For our Upholstery segment, we maintain raw materials and work-in-process inventory at our manufacturing locations. Finished goods inventory is maintained at our six regional distribution centers as well as our manufacturing locations. Our regional distribution centers allow us to streamline the warehousing and distribution processes for our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network, including both company-owned stores and independently-owned stores. Our regional distribution centers also allow us to reduce the number of individual warehouses needed to supply our retail outlets and help us reduce inventory levels at our manufacturing and retail locations. 
 For our Casegoods segment, we import wood furniture from Asian vendors, resulting in long lead times on these products. To address these long lead times and meet our customers' delivery requirements, we maintain higher levels of finished goods inventory in our domestic warehouses, as a percentage of sales, of our casegoods products than our upholstery products. 
 Our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores have finished goods inventory at the stores for display purposes. 
 Our Joybird business maintains raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods inventory at their manufacturing location. Additional finished goods inventory for Joybird is stored in a warehouse or in-transit to the end consumer. 
 Our inventory increased $12.1 million during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2019. We will continue to manage our inventory levels to ensure they are appropriate relative to our sales volume, while maintaining our focus on service to our customers. 
  Accounts Receivable:    Our accounts receivable decreased $10.8 million as of year end fiscal 2019 compared with year end fiscal 2018. The decrease in accounts receivable was partially due to fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2019 being lower than those in the fourth quarter of the prior year for our Upholstery and Casegoods segments. We monitor our customers' accounts and limit our credit exposure to certain independent dealers and strive to decrease our days' sales outstanding where possible. Our days' sales outstanding is a measure of the time needed to collect outstanding accounts receivable once we have completed a sale. Our days' sales outstanding decreased by approximately three days during fiscal 2019. 
 7

    Accounts Payable:    Our accounts payable increased $3.0 million as of year end fiscal 2019 compared with year end fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2019. 
  Customer Deposits:    We collect a deposit from our customers at the time a customer order is placed in one of our company-owned retail stores or through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. Customer deposits increased $11.5 million as of fiscal year end 2019 compared with year end fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily a result of the fiscal 2019 acquisitions. 
   Customers 
 Our wholesale customers are furniture retailers. While primarily located throughout the United States and Canada, we also have customers located in various other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand. Sales in our Upholstery and Casegoods segments are almost entirely to furniture retailers, but we also sell directly to end consumers through our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores that make up our Retail segment and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. 
 We have formal agreements with many furniture retailers for them to display and merchandise products from one or more of our operating units and sell them to consumers in dedicated retail space, either in stand-alone stores or dedicated proprietary galleries or studios within their stores. We consider this dedicated space to be "proprietary." For our Upholstery and Casegoods segments, our fiscal 2019 customer mix based on sales was approximately 60% proprietary, 15% major dealers such as Art Van Furniture, Nebraska Furniture Mart and Slumberland Furniture, and 25% other independent retailers. 
 The success of our product distribution model relies heavily on having retail floor space that is dedicated to displaying and marketing our products. The 353-store La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® network is central to this approach. In addition, we sell product through proprietary space within other retail furniture stores, primarily La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, Kincaid Shoppes, and other international locations. Additionally, our Joybird business, which sells product almost exclusively online to end consumers through its website, www.joybird.com, also has a limited amount of proprietary retail floor space that it uses as a showroom to develop its brand. 
 Maintaining, updating, and, when appropriate, expanding our proprietary distribution network is a key part of our overall sales and marketing strategy. We intend to not only increase the number of stores in the network but also to continue to improve their quality, including upgrading old-format stores to our new concept design through remodels and relocations. At the end of fiscal 2019, less than five percent of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores in the network have not been transitioned to our new format. As we continue to maintain and update our current stores to improve the quality of the network, the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network plans to open, relocate or remodel 20 to 25 stores during fiscal 2020, all of which will feature our new concept store designs. 
 We select independent dealers for our proprietary La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network based on factors such as their management and financial qualifications and the potential for distribution in specific geographical areas. This proprietary distribution benefits La-Z-Boy, our dealers and our consumers. It enables La-Z-Boy to concentrate our marketing with sales personnel dedicated to our entire product line, and only that line and approved accessories. It also allows dealers that join this proprietary group to take advantage of best practices, with which other proprietary dealers have succeeded, and we facilitate forums for these dealers to share them. These La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores provide our consumers a full-service shopping experience with a large variety of products, knowledgeable sales associates, and design service consultants.

     Orders and Backlog 
 We typically build upholstery units based on specific dealer orders, either for dealer stock or to fill consumers' custom orders. We import casegoods product primarily to fill our internal orders, rather than customer or consumer orders, resulting in higher finished goods inventory on hand as a percentage of sales. Because the size of our backlog at a given time may not be indicative of our future sales, we do not rely entirely on backlogs to predict future sales. 
 Our Upholstery segment backlogs as of April 27, 2019, and April 28, 2018, were approximately $66.9 million and $69.7 million, respectively, which was driven by a decrease in orders during the last few weeks of the current fiscal year as compared with the prior fiscal year. Our Casegoods segment backlogs were $7.4 million and $7.3 million, or essentially flat, as of April 27, 2019, and April 28, 2018, respectively. Our Corporate and Other backlog as of April 27, 2019, was $3.7 million which relates to the addition of the Joybird business that we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
   Competitive Conditions 
 We are the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential (living and family room, bedroom, and dining room) furniture in the United States, as measured by annual sales volume. 
 Alternative distribution channels have increasingly affected our retail markets. Direct-to-consumer brands, such as Article and Burrow, bypass brick and mortar retailers entirely or in some cases have developed a product that can be shipped more easily than traditional upholstered furniture, thus increasing competition for our products. The increased ability of consumers to purchase furniture through various furniture manufacturers' and digital-only retailers' internet websites, including companies such as Amazon, Hayneedle, QVC, and Wayfair, which operate with lower overhead costs than a brick-and-mortar retailer, has also increased competition in the industry. Companies such as Costco, Home Depot, IKEA, Sam's Club, Target, Wal-Mart, and others, also offer products that compete with some of our product lines. 
 The home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, customer service (product availability and delivery), price, and location. We compete primarily by emphasizing our brand and the value, comfort, quality, and styling of our products. In addition, we remain committed to innovation while striving to provide outstanding customer service, exceptional dealer support, and efficient on-time delivery. Maintaining, updating, and expanding our proprietary distribution system, including identifying desirable retail locations, is a key strategic initiative for us in striving to remain competitive. We compete in the mid- to upper-mid price point, and a shift in consumer taste and trends to lower-priced products could negatively affect our competitive position. 
 In the Upholstery segment, our largest competitors are Ashley, Bassett, Best Chair, Flexsteel, Klaussner, Kuka, Man Wah, Natuzzi, and Southern Motion. 
 In the Casegoods segment, our main competitors are Bassett, Bernhardt, Hooker Furniture, and Lacquer Craft. The Casegoods segment faces additional market pressures from foreign manufacturers entering the United States market and increased direct purchases from foreign suppliers by large United States retailers. 
 The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores operate in the retail furniture industry in the United States and Canada, and different stores have different competitors based on their geographic locations. Competitors include: Arhaus, Ashley, Bassett Furniture Direct, Bob's Discount Furniture, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Restoration Hardware, Havertys, Williams-Sonoma, several other regional competitors (for example Art Van Furniture, Raymour & Flanigan Furniture, and Slumberland Furniture), and family-owned independent furniture stores. 
 9

   In our Corporate & Other segment, our Joybird business sells almost exclusively online and competes primarily with Amazon, Article, CB2, Love Sac, Maiden Home, Wayfair and West Elm. 
 In addition to the larger competitors listed above, a substantial number of small and medium-sized companies operate within our business segments, all of which are highly competitive. 
   Trademarks, Licenses and Patents 
 We own the La-Z-Boy trademark, which is essential to the Upholstery and Retail segments of our business, and the Joybird trademark, which is essential to our e-commerce business. We also own a number of other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We consider our La-Z-Boy trademark to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered that trademark and others in the United States and various other countries where our products are sold. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal. We license the use of the La-Z-Boy trademark to our major international partners and dealers outside of North America. We also license the use of the La-Z-Boy trademark on contract office furniture, outdoor furniture, and non-furniture products, as these arrangements enhance our brand awareness, broaden the perceptions of La-Z-Boy, and create visibility of the La-Z-Boy brand in channels outside of the residential furniture industry. In addition, we license to our branded dealers the right to use our La-Z-Boy trademark in connection with the sale of our products and related services, on their signs, and in other ways, which we consider to be a key part of our marketing strategies. We provide more information about those dealers, under "Customers." 
 We hold a number of United States and foreign patents that we actively enforce. We have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable, but these patents do expire at various times. 
 While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property right (other than the La-Z-Boy trademark) is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole. We vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement. 
   Compliance with Environmental Regulations 
 Our manufacturing operations involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws, and we are involved in a small number of remediation actions and site investigations concerning these substances. Based on a review of all currently known facts and our experience with previous environmental matters, we currently do not believe it is probable that we will have any additional loss for environmental matters that would be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Employees 
 We employed approximately 9,700 full-time equivalent employees as of April 27, 2019, compared with 9,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2018. We employed approximately 7,400 employees in our Upholstery segment, 200 in our Casegoods segment, 1,400 in our Retail segment, 400 in our Joybird business, and the remaining employees are corporate personnel. We employ the majority of our employees on a full-time basis.
