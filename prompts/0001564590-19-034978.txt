--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a global multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company. We are market leaders in the breeding, production and sale of alfalfa seed and sorghum seed. We also have a growing commercial market presence in sunflower and maintain an active stevia development program.
 Our seed platform develops and supplies high quality germplasm designed to produce higher yields for farmers worldwide. We produce approximately 250 seed products in the Western United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and South Africa for sale in more than 30 countries. We maintain an active product pipeline and expect to introduce more than 20 new products during the 2020-2022 fiscal years.
 Founded in 1980, we began our operations as a limited producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties bred for warm climates and high-yields, including varieties that can thrive in poor, saline soils. Over the years we have built a diversified, global agricultural platform through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, including:
 
 
• | Our 2012 acquisition of Imperial Valley Seeds, Inc., which enabled us to expand production of non-GMO alfalfa seed into California's Imperial Valley, thereby ensuring a non-GMO uncontaminated source of alfalfa seed due to the prohibition on growing GMO crops in the Imperial Valley, as well as enabling us to diversify our production areas and distribution channels;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2012 acquisition of a portfolio of dormant alfalfa germplasm, which launched our entry into the dormant alfalfa market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2013 acquisition of Seed Genetics International Pty Ltd (now S&W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd), the leading producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed in South Australia, which made us the largest non-dormant alfalfa seed company in the world, with production capabilities in both hemispheres;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2014 acquisition of alfalfa production and research facility assets and conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa germplasm from Pioneer (“Pioneer”), which substantially broadened and improved our dormant alfalfa germplasm portfolio and deepened our production, research and product development capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2016 acquisition of the business and assets of SV Genetics Pty Ltd, a developer of proprietary hybrid sorghum and sunflower seed germplasm, which expanded our crop focus into two areas which we believe have high global growth potential;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2018 acquisition of the assets of Chromatin, Inc. and related companies, which positioned us to become a global leader in the hybrid sorghum seed market and enhanced our distribution channels both internationally and within a U.S.-based farmer-dealer network; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2018 joint venture with AGT Foods Africa Proprietary Limited (AGT) based in South Africa named SeedVision Proprietary Limited (SeedVision). SeedVision will leverage AGT's African-based production and processing facilities to produce S&W's hybrid sunflower, grain sorghum, and forage sorghum to be sold by SeedVision in the African continent, Middle East countries, and Europe.

Our Strategy
 
The global agriculture market is experiencing rapid change driven by population growth, environmental challenges, limited availability of arable land, diverse regulatory requirements and evolving consumer demands. As a result, farmers and other industry participants face ongoing pressure to cost-effectively increase productivity and output. These factors and others have led to strategic realignments and significant consolidation in the seed industry, leaving a small number of large players.
 
We believe this environment presents an opportunity to build a global agricultural company focused on crop and market opportunities that large seed companies may overlook, underserve or ineffectively address.

We believe our core strengths listed below position us to capitalize on this market opportunity:
 
 
• | Strong Germplasm Asset Base and Development Capabilities. We believe we have the largest and most diversified alfalfa and sorghum germplasm pool in the world. Our germplasm pool offers traits sought by farmers who grow forage hay, forage sorghum and grain sorghum, including high yield, drought tolerance and disease tolerance. We continue to invest in research and development programs in the United States, Australia, Europe and South America with an emphasis on driving trait improvement across all of our crop categories. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost-Efficient Global Supply Chain. We produce seed in the Western United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and South Africa under contract with select third-party growers. We currently maintain more than 140 grower relationships, many of which are longstanding. Our global, but localized, production capabilities allow us to produce seed close to the customer to ensure the seed product is developed specifically for the conditions and requirements of that customer’s region and produced at low cost. We condition and package seed primarily in our own facilities located in California, Idaho, Texas and Australia. We believe that direct ownership of our production facility assets gives us more flexibility to react to demand changes unique to each geography, greater control over product quality and a lower cost structure. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global Distribution Capabilities and Relationships. We sell our seed through one of the industry’s largest networks of distributors and dealers, reaching more than 30 countries. Our recent acquisition of the Chromatin farmer-dealer network added a new element to our United States distribution capabilities that we believe can support sales growth across crop categories. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep Industry Expertise. We believe that our management team has deep industry experience and a demonstrated record of success that is unmatched for a seed industry company of our size. Our leadership team includes both proven industry executives recruited to our company and top talent retained through our various acquisitions. Mark Wong, our Chief Executive Officer, has over 40 years senior executive experience in the agriculture industry and has successfully built, operated, and sold multiple seed companies to industry leaders across multiple crops, including sorghum, corn, soybeans, and vegetables. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our goal is to be a leading multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company; delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders.  To reach our goal, we have prioritized the following strategic initiatives:
 
 
• | Develop and Launch New Products that Address Unmet Market Needs. We expect to introduce more than 20 new products during the 2020-2022 fiscal years across our current crop offerings. We also plan to continue development activities aimed to generate high-value, improved traits in our crops. These activities include our collaboration with Calyxt, Inc. to apply next generation gene-editing technology to our elite alfalfa seed genetics and our own efforts to bring to market sorghum seed that incorporates our proprietary, patent-pending herbicide tolerant trait. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build Our Multi-Channel Distribution Network and Execute on International Cross-Selling Opportunities. We recently realigned our organization across geographic lines (as opposed to product lines), which has renewed our sales focus. We expect this approach will help us make the best use of recently acquired distribution assets like the United States farmer-dealer network acquired from Chromatin and unlock potential sales synergies through international cross-selling of products (particularly in Europe and Australia). We believe that a more robust, diverse distribution network will allow us to continue to evolve beyond our historical dependence on certain geographical markets which carry higher political, regulatory and economic risks. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exploit International Production Capability for Best-In Class Cost Structure. Our streamlined international supply chain provides us with flexibility in sourcing product to meet customer needs. We are focused on exploiting this ability to shift production to low-cost areas to both support our competitive position and improve our margins. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4


 
• | Commercialize Stevia. We believe that an opportunity exists to bring to market new stevia varieties that can both meet taste requirements of consumers and have yield quality that would enable farmers to profitably grow stevia in North and South America. We plan to leverage our proprietary stevia germplasm to form collaborations and commercial agreements with supply chain partners to create a U.S.-based stevia production industry for high-quality stevia sweetener with superior taste profiles to supply major customers in the U.S. market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Crop Offerings and Market Share of Existing Offerings Through Strategic Acquisitions. We expect that ongoing consolidation and realignment in the seed industry will present opportunities for us to acquire assets that no longer are a strategic fit in the product portfolios of larger industry players or that smaller industry players are unable to effectively exploit. We believe that our production and distribution platforms position us to more fully realize the potential of these types of assets. Moreover, we have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating diverse operations into our seed platform and rebalancing our product portfolio. We intend to emphasize disciplined capital and resource allocation, with a strong focus on return on invested capital and evaluating opportunities to expand our crop offerings or increase our share of existing crop markets.

Our Current Crops
 
Alfalfa
 
The Alfalfa Market
 Alfalfa seed is primarily used for growing alfalfa hay, which is grown throughout the world as “forage” for livestock, including dairy and beef cattle, horses and sheep. It is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed or fed as green-chop to ruminant livestock. The alfalfa industry (and therefore the alfalfa seed industry) is highly dependent on the dairy industry, which is the largest consumer of alfalfa hay. As markets around the world continue to expand to a more westernized diet with high-protein consumption, the demands for alfalfa production around the world should continue to increase.
 Alfalfa is indigenous to the Middle East where it is considered a “non-dormant” plant, meaning it grows year-round. “Dormant” varieties of alfalfa have adapted to cold climates by going dormant during periods when frost or snow conditions would otherwise kill them. Dormancy is rated using a numerical system under which “dormant” varieties are rated toward the lower end of a 1 through 11 scale, such as 2 through 4, while “non-dormant” varieties are rated toward the upper end of the scale, such as 8 through 11. The number typically identifies the number of cuttings that a farmer might be able to obtain each year. 
 While exact production estimates worldwide are difficult to obtain, we estimate that approximately 150 million pounds of alfalfa seed are produced worldwide each year, roughly divided evenly between non-dormant and dormant production. 
 
S&W’s Alfalfa Seed Portfolio
 
Our current portfolio of over 200 commercialized alfalfa seed products spans both non-dormant and dormant categories. Our specialty is high-yield alfalfa varieties with a wide range of adaptation across many growing environments.   Our alfalfa seed products include varieties that, depending upon the particular variety, exhibit the traits that forage hay farmers most value, such as high yield, root rot resistance, lodging resistance, salt tolerance, drought tolerance, leafhopper resistance and stem nematode resistance.
 Our non-dormant breeding program is focused on maximizing yield regardless of soil and water salinity. 
 Although we recently licensed certain of our commercial dormant alfalfa varieties to Corteva Agriscience, Inc. (“Corteva”) on an exclusive basis, we maintained our highest performing dormant alfalfa varieties as well as our dormant alfalfa breeding program and are continuing the development of the next-generation varieties from that germplasm. Our dormant alfalfa breeding emphasizes high yield and forage quality, developing hardy alfalfa varieties that are resistant to disease and stress.
 5


Europe, the Middle East, Australia and certain other parts of the world currently prohibit the sale of genetically modified organism (GMO) alfalfa. Historically, we have not employed genetic engineering in the breeding of our current commercial alfalfa seed varieties, so that we have products that can be sold throughout the world. More recently, we have expanded our research and development efforts beyond our classically-bred proprietary alfalfa seed breeding program. One result of these efforts was our recent commercial release of a Roundup Ready® alfalfa variety incorporating a herbicide resistance trait (under license from Forage Genetics International) into our proprietary germplasm. We also are collaborating with Calyxt, Inc. to research, develop, produce and commercialize alfalfa seed products involving next generation gene-editing technology. The goal of this collaboration is to create novel traits that are currently classified as non-GMO, which ultimately can be incorporated into our seed varieties. While we believe this relationship is beginning to deliver meaningful product developments, we do not anticipate a meaningful contribution to our revenue before fiscal year 2022, if at all. 
 Sorghum Seed
 The Sorghum Market
 Sorghum comes in two types, forage and grain, and is considered one of the indispensable crops in the world. It has traditionally been used for livestock feed, as well as ethanol, but is gaining increasingly in popularity in food products in the U.S. due to its gluten-free characteristics, as well as its antioxidant, high protein, lower fat, high fiber and non-GMO properties. Consequently, grain sorghum is becoming a desired substitute for wheat, rye and barley. Additionally, the pet food industry increasingly utilizes grain sorghum for its nutritional benefits and enhanced digestibility.
 Similar to alfalfa, sorghum grows well in poor soil and drought conditions, thanks to its hardiness, market versatility and high-quality seed. Sorghum requires less water to grow than many other crops and is generally used as a replacement for corn and other grains in areas where water is scarce. In Africa, sorghum can be a food staple for human consumption. The majority of the world’s sorghum is grown in developing countries, primarily in Africa and Asia
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) projects that world grain sorghum production for 2019/2020 will be approximately 59 million metric tons based on 41.5 million hectares of production. The USDA further projects the 2019/2020 U.S. sorghum crop to encompass 6 million acres (2.4 million hectares) with total production of 375 million bushels of grain sorghum (9.5 million metric tons). 
 S&W’s Sorghum Portfolio
 Our current portfolio of approximately 50 commercialized sorghum seed products includes both forage and grain sorghum. We believe that our sorghum hybrids are unmatched and consistently out-yield competitor products in select markets.
 
Our sorghum portfolio and development platform was created through the acquisition of assets from Chromatin, SV Genetics and NexSteppe, Inc. and represents the cumulative, long-term development investments made in each of those programs. We are continuing those development and commercialization efforts.
 
We plan to commercially launch approximately seven new sorghum products during the fiscal years 2020-2022, including new Sugarcane Aphid tolerant hybrids to address a significant market need. We also are moving forward to validate and produce launch seed of sorghum hybrids, incorporating our patent-pending herbicide tolerant trait that was developed in cooperation with the United Sorghum Checkoff Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Sunflower
 The Sunflower Market
 Sunflowers have multiple specialty uses including oil, birdseed and human consumption. Our current sunflower seed focus is on the oil market. Sunflower oil is light in taste and appearance and supplies more Vitamin E than any other vegetable oil. It is a combination of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats with low saturated fat levels. The versatility of this healthy oil is recognized by cooks internationally, valued for its frying performance and health benefits. With multiple types of sunflower oils available, it meets the needs of consumer and food manufacturers alike for a healthy and high performance non-transgenic vegetable oil. Additionally, sunflower is being sought after as a source of non-GMO oils. USDA projects global sunflower seed production for 2019/2020 at 49.9 million tons, up 5 percent from 2018/2019. The sunflower seed oil trade is forecasted to rise, supported by demand in India, the EU, North Africa, and the Middle East.
S&W’s Sunflower Portfolio
 We currently have three high-yield sunflower hybrids in the market. We have research and development programs in Australia and Europe to expand our market presence. Our sunflower program is focused on developing elite disease resistance sunflower seed hybrids. We partner with leading companies around world to develop herbicide resistant characteristics, specific oil profiles, both polyunsaturated and linoleic, and maximize yield potential for different growing conditions around the world
Stevia
 Stevia and the Sweetener Industry
 Stevia is a relative newcomer in the estimated over $100 billion global sweetener market. Stevia is a part of the high-intensity sweetener (HIS) market, also known as the non-caloric sweetener market, which is a $2.4 billion segment of the overall market.  Although the overall market is still dominated by sugar, sugar substitutes continue to increase in market share as consumer concern over sugar intake increases. The global obesity and diabetes epidemic is expected to drive growth of products like stevia, supported by sugar taxes, which have become prevalent in developed economies.  Stevia leaf and its refined products constitute a natural, non-caloric high intensity sweetener, estimated to be 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. Its taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar. It has the advantage of not breaking down with heat, making it more stable for cooking than other sugar alternatives. In the U.S., approximately 70% of all new products formulated with stevia are beverages, with the remainder split between diverse categories, including dairy products and baked goods.
 The stevia plant is indigenous to the rain forests of Paraguay and has been used as a sweetener in its raw, unprocessed form for hundreds of years. In recent years, it has been grown commercially in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, parts of Central America, Thailand, China and the U.S. Currently, the majority of global commercial stevia production occurs in China.
 The incorporation of stevia-derived extracts into foods and beverages in the U.S. has seen a rapid increase since the beginning of 2009, when stevia was first introduced as a sweetener alternative to sugar and approved by the FDA as generally regarded as safe. Within the high impact sweetener category, stevia represented a $423 million market in 2014.  Beverages account for 50% of the stevia extract market in 2016, and major soft drink producers have active programs to further develop the use of stevia in soda. Based on IHS Market projections, from 2016-2021, stevia is expected to grow at 8.1% year-year, with higher growth rates predicted for Europe. While sales of artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, acesulfame K and sucralose still dominate the high-intensity sweetener market, consumer demand for artificial sweeteners has seen a decline since the introduction of stevia. 
 S&W’s Stevia Program
 
The majority of the global stevia supply is produced in Asia, as current varieties lack adaptive characteristics that would permit farmers to profitably grow them in other global agricultural regions. We believe that there will be significant future demand for U.S.-produced stevia. Since 2009, we have dedicated significant research and development assets toward developing stevia into a U.S.-grown crop. We have employed advanced plant breeding and chemical analysis techniques to identify and select varieties that can address this potential market. In early 2019, 
 7


we opened a dedicated stevia field breeding station in Tifton, GA to further support the breeding effort and select new varieties adapted to the Southeast growing regions targeted for initial cultivation of stevia in the United States.
 
Since its inception, our stevia breeding program has generated four patented varieties, and we are working closely with potential supply chain collaborators and customers to develop more advanced varieties that can both meet taste requirements of consumers and have field performance that would enable farmers to profitably grow stevia in the United States.   
 
We plan to leverage our proprietary stevia germplasm to form collaborations and commercial agreements with supply chain partners to create a U.S.-based stevia production industry for high-quality stevia sweetener with superior taste profiles to supply major customers in the U.S. market.
 Product Development
 We conduct our breeding and development programs in the United States, Australia, Europe and South America.   
 
Our breeding programs are designed to make steady genetic improvements in our germplasm base, which we use to create better-performing varieties and hybrids for our customers. Development of a typical new variety or hybrid can take as little as five years or as long as 18 years, depending on methodology and the desired agronomic traits. Because of the many years required to develop a new variety or hybrid, we believe our successful breeding program allows us to offer seed varieties or hybrids incorporating a combination of characteristics desired by farmers that are not available from any other source, thereby providing us with a competitive advantage. 
 We also plan to continue development activities aimed at generating high-value improved traits in our crops. With this objective in mind, we are collaborating, and continue to look for opportunities to collaborate, with other companies that have technologies that we believe complement our proprietary products and/or our research and development breeding expertise to develop currently unavailable specialized seed products. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 We currently sell approximately 250 seed products in more than 30 countries. Our principal markets for alfalfa sales are the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, the Middle East, North Africa, and Australia. Our sorghum sales are focused in the United States, Mexico, Australia, Europe and South Africa.   Our sunflower sales are primarily in Europe, Asia and Australia. 
 We primarily sell our seed products under the S&W brand or other brands we own, such as Sorghum Partners®. To a limited extent, we also sell some seed under private-label arrangements with distributors.
 Our customers are primarily distributors and dealers. Our distributors and dealers, in turn, sell to farmers. We believe that selling through dealers and distributors enables our products to reach growers in areas where there are geographic or other constraints on direct sales efforts. We select dealers and distributors based on shared vision, technical expertise, local market knowledge and financial stability. Over the years, we have built dealer/distributor loyalty through an emphasis on service, access to breeders, ongoing training and promotional material support. We limit the number of dealers and distributors with whom we have relationships in any particular area in order to provide adequate support and opportunity to those with whom we choose to do business.
 
Our acquisition of Chromatin significantly expanded our retail and farmer-dealer network across the plains and Midwest of United States to provide us an expanded sales channel for our products.
 Both farmers and dealers use pest-control advisors who recommend the varieties or hybrids that will produce the best results in a particular location. Therefore, a key part of our marketing strategy is to educate the consultants, as well as the farmers, as to benefits of our seed varieties and hybrids.
 8


We believe that our best marketing tool is the dissemination of information regarding the quality and characteristics of our propriety seed products to those persons who make the growing decisions. We continue to place advertisements in trade journals, agriculture publications, social media and participate in seed industry conferences and trade shows and engage in various other educational and outreach programs as we deem appropriate.
 Most of our international marketing efforts are accomplished through face-to-face meetings with our existing and potential customers and their end users. In addition, we participate in international trade shows to boost our international presence and sales efforts.
 
In fiscal 2019, sales to domestic customers increased as a percentage of our total sales, primarily as a result of entering into a license agreement with Corteva which generated license revenue of $34.2 million. Sales into international markets accounted for 20% in fiscal 2019 versus 35% in fiscal 2018.  We recently terminated our alfalfa distribution agreement with Corteva and entered into a prepaid license agreement with Corteva in fiscal 2019.   As a result, we anticipate that international sales will increase as a percentage of our total sales in fiscal 2020. 
 
We recently realigned our organization across geographic lines (as opposed to product lines), which has renewed our sales focus. We expect this approach will help us make the best use of recently acquired distribution assets like the U.S. farmer-dealer network acquired from Chromatin and exploit potential sales synergies through international cross-selling of products (particularly in Europe and Australia). We believe that a more robust, diverse distribution network will allow us to continue to evolve beyond our historical dependence on certain geographical markets which carry higher political, regulatory, and economic risks.
 Seed Production
 
Global Production
 We produce seed in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and South Africa under contract with select third-party contract growers. We currently maintain over 140 grower relationships. Our network of growers has the expertise needed to successfully grow high quality seed products. We have worked with many of the same growers on a long-term basis, and we believe that we have strong relationships with them. We allocate our seed production among our growers so that we can purchase the proper mix of seed each year. Our contracts with growers have terms ranging from one to seven years, depending on the crop and the production area. Our global, but localized, production capabilities allow us to produce close to the customer to ensure the seed product is developed specifically for the conditions and requirements of that region and is produced at the lowest cost. 
 We condition and package seed primarily in our own facilities located in California, Idaho, Texas and Australia; although in some markets (for example, Australia) we use third-party processing services. We believe that direct ownership of production facility assets gives us more flexibility to react to demand changes unique to each geography, greater control over product quality and a lower cost structure.   
 S&W Australia Production
 S&W Australia has contracts with growers in Western Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales to grow its alfalfa seed. In the Southern Hemisphere, alfalfa seed is grown counter seasonally to the Northern Hemisphere and is harvested annually, in March through early May. 
 Under its current form of alfalfa seed production agreement, S&W Australia provides foundation seed to each grower and grants each grower a license to use its seed for the purpose of production of seed for sale to S&W Australia. Each grower is responsible for all costs of the crop production. Title in the produced seed passes to S&W Australia upon it being certified compliant; and, if the seed is not compliant, title will only pass to S&W Australia upon S&W Australia’s further agreement to purchase the non-compliant seed. S&W Australia uses a staggered payment system with the growers of its alfalfa and white clover seed, and the payment amounts are based upon an estimated budget price (“EBP”) for compliant seed. EBP is a forecast of the final price that S&W Australia believes will be achieved taking into account prevailing and predicted market conditions at the time the estimate is made. Following the grower’s delivery of uncleaned seed to a milling facility, S&W Australia typically pays 40% of the 
 9


EBP to the grower based on a percentage of the pre-cleaning weight. Following this initial payment and prior to the final payment, S&W Australia will make a series of scheduled progress payments and, if applicable, a bonus payment for “first grade” (high quality) alfalfa seed. The final price payable to each grower (and therefore the total price) is dependent upon and subject to adjustment based upon the clean weight of the seed grown, on the average price at which S&W Australia sells the pooled seed and other costs incurred by S&W Australia. Accordingly, the total price paid by S&W Australia to its grower may be more or less than the EBP. S&W Australia’s seed production agreements for alfalfa provide for an initial term of seven years and an optional renewal term of three years. S&W Australia’s seed production agreements for white clover provide for an initial term of two years and an optional renewal term of one year. Historically, S&W Australia has not required its growers to harvest seed in every year under the seed production agreement. Some growers have elected to have non-harvest years, and their alfalfa is cut for hay or used for grazing instead of being harvested for seed production.
 Seasonality
 We contract with growers based upon our anticipated market demand; we mill, clean and stock the seed during the harvest season and ship from inventory throughout the year. However, our seed business is seasonal.  In the Northern hemisphere, production and harvest occurs from March through September and processing and shipping finished goods primarily occurs from July through February. In the Southern hemisphere, production and harvest occurs from October through March and processing and shipping primarily occurs from March through August.
Proprietary Rights
 Ownership of and access to intellectual property rights are important to us. We sell proprietary seed varieties and hybrids that have been specially selected to manifest the traits we deem best suited to particular regions in which our seed is planted. Our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon the proprietary nature of the seeds, seedlings, processes, technologies and materials owned by or used by us or our growers. If any competitors independently develop any technologies that substantially equal or surpass our process technology, it will adversely affect our competitive position. 
 In some cases, we obtain patent protection or plant breeder rights registrations for certain of our seed products.   However, our principal method of guarding our proprietary varieties and hybrids is exercising a high degree of control over the supply chain. As part of this control process, we require our growers to deliver back to us all seed derived from our proprietary varieties and, in the case, of hybrids, limit supply of parent seed that enables hybrid production. Historically, we have found that these control mechanisms have been an effective means to protect our proprietary seed. However, because we often do not have more formal proprietary rights protections, it would be possible for persons with access to our seed or plants grown from our seed to potentially reproduce proprietary seed, which could significantly harm our business and our reputation. 
 Competition
 Competition in the seed industry both domestically and internationally is intense, and we believe it is intensifying with industry consolidation.  We face direct competition by other seed companies, including multinational agriculture companies, regional seed companies and small family-owned businesses, as well as subsidiaries or other affiliates of chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
 We believe that the key competitive drivers in the industry are proven performance, customer support in the field and value, which takes into account not simply the price of the seed but also yield in the field.
 In the U.S. market, our principal competitors in our alfalfa seed business are Forage Genetics International (a subsidiary of Land O’ Lakes, Inc.), Pioneer and Alforex Seeds (subsidiaries of Corteva), and Pacific International Seed Company, Inc.  In addition, S&W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd (“S&W Australia”), our wholly owned Australian subsidiary, faces regional competitors in the proprietary alfalfa seed market such as Heritage Seeds Pty. Ltd., PGG Wrightson Seeds Ltd, Naracoorte Seeds Pty. Ltd., and Pasture Genetics Pty Ltd (formerly Seed Distributors Pty. Ltd.). Various other minor companies compete with S&W Australia through sales of Siriver, a common alfalfa variety. S&W Australia also faces competition from lower value alfalfa seed produced in the European Union and, to a lesser extent, Argentina.

Our principal competitors in sorghum are Pioneer, DeKalb (a subsidiary of Bayer), Advanta, Nuseed, and Heritage Seeds Pty. Ltd.
 Our principal competitors in sunflower are Pioneer, Nuseed, Dyna-Gro Seed (a subsidiary of Nutrien Ag Solutions), Syngenta AG, Advanta, Limagrain, and KWS SAAT SE & Co.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may:
  
• | succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our products or potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products or potential products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our products or potential products obsolete or less preferable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize potential products we might otherwise develop;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withstand price competition more successfully than we can;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 Our agricultural operations are subject to a broad range of evolving environmental laws and regulations applicable to the markets in which we operate.  These environmental laws and regulations are intended to address concerns related to air quality, storm water discharge and management and disposal of agricultural chemicals relating to seed treatment. 
 Compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process that does not, and is not expected to, have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Environmental concerns are, however, inherent in most major agricultural operations, including those conducted by us, and there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be material. Moreover, it is possible that future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, and further restrictions on the use of agricultural chemicals, could result in increased compliance costs.
 We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the transport, export/import and sale of seed applicable in the markets in which operate.  
 Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations) and local government regulations.

Corporate History

 In April 2013, we, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary, S&W Holdings Australia Pty Ltd, an Australia corporation (f/k/a S&W Seed Australia Pty Ltd “S&W Holdings”), consummated an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Seed Genetics International Pty Ltd, an Australia corporation (“SGI”), from SGI’s shareholders.
