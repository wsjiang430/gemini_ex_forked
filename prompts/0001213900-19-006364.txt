Our Compounds Licensed from BioLite
 
We are currently co-developing six new drug candidates with BioLite and BioLite Taiwan. Below is the description of each of the six new drug candidates.
 

I. | ABV- 1501 Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Combination therapy for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (“TNBC”) 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ABV- 1501 is developed from BLI-1401-2 whose active pharmaceutical ingredient is Yukiguni Maitake Extract 404. MSKCC conducted the Phase I clinical trial of a polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake mushroom), which is very similar to Yukiguni Maitake Extract 404. The Phase I trial focused on Grifola frondosa extract’s immunological effects on breast cancer patients. The results of the Phase I trial showed that oral administration of a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom is associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application of ABV-1501 for the Phase II clinical trials referenced with MSKCC Maitake and such Phase II IND was approved in March 2016 by the U.S. FDA. 
● | We are currently collaborating with BioHopeKing Corporation and in the process to file clinical trial application to the Taiwan FDA (“TFDA”) for conducting this combination therapy trial in Taiwan. 


II. | ABV-1504 Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) 
----+------------------------------------------------

 
We are developing and researching ABV-1504, a botanical reuptake inhibitor that targets norepinephrine. Prior to clinical trials, we, through BioLite Taiwan, conducted radioligand-binding assay tests on ABV-1504. Radioligand-binding assays are used to characterize the binding effects of a drug to its target receptor. In the case of ABV-1504, the receptors of radioligand-binding assays are norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. The radioligand-binding assay test on norepinephrine was conducted from May 3 to May 8, 2007 and the radioligand-binding assay test on dopamine and serotonin was administered from November 26 to December 5, 2007. The result of radioligand-binding assay to norepinephrine of ABV-1504was 2.102 μg/ml of IC50, which indicated ABV-1504’s high inhibitory efficiency on norepinephrine. The results of radioligand-binding assay to dopamine and serotonin were not as good as to norepinephrine, which indicated lower inhibitory efficiency. Because research has shown that norepinephrine inhibitors can alleviate the level of depression, our research team saw ABV-1504’s potential to treat depression and decided to commence the clinical trial process of ABV-1504.
 
In 2013, ABVC, through BioLite, successfully completed the Phase I clinical trial of ABV-1504. The primary objective of the Phase I study was to assess the safety profile of ABV-1504. The safety endpoint was assessed based on the results of physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory data, electrocardiograms (“ECG”), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale evaluation and a number of adverse events during the study period. We began recruiting healthy people as subjects for the Phase I trial in Taiwan on October 30, 2012. For the Phase I trial, we screened 85 healthy volunteers at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital and eventually enrolled 30 people as trial subjects. We divided the subjects into four cohort groups and administered ABV-1504oral capsules of 380 mg, 1140 mg, 2280 mg, and 3800 mg to the subjects in each cohort group, respectively. BioLite visited the first subject the first time on November 13, 2012 and the last subject the last time on July 5, 2013. During the said period, no subject had a serious adverse event nor discontinued the trial due to any adverse events. ABVC did not observe any clinically significant findings in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory measurements, and C-SSRS throughout the treatment period. However, ABVC observed the following mild adverse events: two subjects with flatulence and one subject with constipation in the single-dose 380mg cohort of seven subjects; one subject with somnolence and one subject with stomatitis ulcer in the single-dose 2,280 mg cohort. Comparatively, two subjects with somnolence and one subject with stomatitis ulcer were observed in the placebo group of seven subjects. ABVC did not observe any suicidal ideation or behavior throughout the trial period. ABV-1504’s Phase I clinical trial results reflected that the oral administration of ABV-1504 to healthy volunteers was safe and well-tolerated at the dose levels of from 380 mg to 3,800 mg.

ABVC received an IND approval to proceed with the Phase II clinical trial of ABV-1504 from the F.D.A. in March 2014 and an IND approval of its Phase II trial from the Taiwan F.D.A. in June 2014. For the Phase II trial, BioLite plans to administer oral capsules to 72 MDD patients (the trial subjects) in a randomized, double-blind study with a placebo control group to assess ABV-1504’s efficacy and safety profile, primarily in accordance with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (“MADRS”). ABVC via BioLite began recruiting Phase II subjects in March 2015 at the following study sites, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei City Hospital-Songde Branch, Tri-Service General Hospital, Wan Fang Hospital and started recruiting MDD patients at Stanford Depression Research Clinic. The first five sites are in Taiwan and the last one is in United States. The primary endpoint of the Phase II trial is to see changes of the subjects’ MADRS total scores from the baseline scores of the placebo subjects within the first six weeks. The secondary objectives of the Phase II trial are to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1504 on other rating scales with secondary endpoints of (i) demonstrating changes in MADRS total scores from baseline scores within the second to seventh weeks and (ii) showing changes in the total scores on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale (DSSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) from the baseline scores in the second, fourth, sixth and seventh week. ABVC plans to measure the percentages of partial responders (subjects with a 25% to 50% decrease of total MADRS scores from the baseline score) and responders (subjects with 50% or more decrease of total MADRS scores from the baseline score) by the second, fourth, sixth and seventh week. Additionally, ABVC intends to monitor the subjects’ performance in accordance with the Safety Assessments and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale from the screening stage to each subject’s last visit as well as to analyze the differences in the mean changes of MADRS, HAM-D-17, HAM-A, DSSS, CGI and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores of the subjects administered with ABV-1504 and the placebo group in the second, fourth, sixth and seventh week. As of the date of this annual report, ABVC continued the efforts on recruiting suitable subjects for the Phase II study which consists of Part I and Part II studies. The Part I study of ABV-1504, which is an open-label study and dose escalation evaluation in twelve patients, six subjects each at 1 (380 mg/capsule) or 2 capsules TID dose for 28 days, has been completed and passed the DSMB (Data and Safety Monitoring Board) committee for entering the Part II study. The Part II study of ABV-1504, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, is aimed to enroll a total of 60 patients. As of the date of this annual report, ABVC has completed the in-live study for a total of 60 patients and had observed zero serious adverse events during this Part II study. Currently in progress are the clinical data lock, bio-statistical analysis and clinical study report preparation of the Part II study.
 

III. | ABV-1505 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We, via BioLite, developed the ADHD indication from the same API of ABV-1504. Also ABV-1505 shares the similar pharmaceutical mechanism of action of ABV-1505 inasmuch that ABV-1505 shows the potential of increasing the level of norepinephrine in human’s nervous system by inhibiting its reabsorption. Because of ABV-1505’s sufficient similarity with ABV-1504, in January 2016 the FDA approved our IND application to conduct ABV-1505’s Phase II clinical trial based on its pretrial research and Phase I trial results of ABV-1504.
 
For the Phase II trial, ABVC plans to recruit a maximum number of 105 ADHD patients as trial subjects in the United States, to whom ABVC intends to administer ABV-1505 oral capsules. ABVC together with its CROs designed a randomized, double-blind dose escalation study with a placebo-controlled group to assess the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1505, primarily against the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (“ADHD-RS-IV”). The primary endpoint of the Phase II trial is a 40% or higher improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV from the respective baseline scores within a period of up to eight weeks. The secondary objective is to determine the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1505 on other rating scales with secondary endpoints of (i) improvements of the total ADHD symptom scores from the respective baseline scores on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self Report: Short Version (“CAARS-S:S”) 18-Item for a treatment period of eight weeks at maximum; (ii) achievement of scores of two or lower on both the Clinical Global Impression-ADHD- Severity (“CGI-ADHD-S”) and Clinical Global Impression-ADHD-Improvement (“CGI-ADHD-I”) from the subjects’ respective baseline scores. As of the date of the annual report, ABVC is engaging with the UCSF for conducting the Phase II trial which consists of Part I and Part II. Part I clinical protocol, which is an open trial, has been approved by UCSF IRB Committee and US FDA and will be initiated in the second quarter of 2019, subject to our financial resources. We cannot guaranty that ABVC will begin the Part I Phase II clinical study of ABV-1505 as we have planned.

IV. | ABV-1702 to treat Myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) 
----+--------------------------------------------------------

 
Through BioLite, ABVC started the preparation for ABV-1702’s Phase II clinical trials after receiving its IND approval from the FDA in July 2016. ABVC plans to recruit fifty-two subjects in the United States who are diagnosed with either IPSS int-1, IPSS int-2 or high risk MDS or CMML and may take azacitidine as part of the subjects’ prescription. Azacitidine is an FDA-approved drug used to treat MDS. ABVC intends to administer ABV-1702 in the oral liquid form along with azacitidine. The Phase II trial is divided into two parts, where Part 1 is to determine the safety and recommended dose level (“RDL”) of ABV-1702 in combination with azacitidine and Part 2 is to determine whether ABV-1702 under the established RDL reduces bactericidal and fungicidal infection in the subjects’ respiratory systems. The primary endpoint of Part 1 Phase II trial is to assess the safety and RDL profile of ABV-1702 administered with azacitidine by measuring ABV-1702’s prohibited toxicity. The secondary endpoints of Phase II Part 1 are to determine the safety, time-to-first infection after first dose (Day 1) of the first azacitidine treatment cycle, reduction in treatment requirements and duration of infections, enhancement of immune responses, improvements of response rates, progression, and survival rates of the subjects under such ABV-1702 - azacitidine combination treatment. The primary endpoint of Part 2 of Phase II is to determine whether ABV-1702 under the established RDL reduces bactericidal and fungicidal infection risks in the subjects’ respiratory systems in combination with azacitidine as compared to the control group with incidence of infections and incidence/frequency of inpatient hospitalization due to infections. The secondary endpoints of Part II are to determine the safety, time-to-first infection after first dose (Day 1) of the first azacitidine treatment cycle, reduction in required dosage and duration of infection, enhancement of immune responses, improvement of response rate, progression, and survival rates of the subjects under the trial conditions.
 
As of the date of this annual report, ABVC planned to commence the Phase II clinical trials of ABV-1702 in the fourth quarter of 2019 although neither BioLite nor ABVC can assure you that the Phase II trial will be initiated as planned. Due to the scarcity of MDS cases, BioLite applied for the orphan drug designation for ABV-1702 or BLI-1301. In April 2016, BioLite submitted a letter to the FDA in response to its queries with additional information about the proposed Phase II trial. 
 

V. | ABV-1703 Pancreatic Cancer 
---+-------------------------------

 
In addition, ABVC developed a new indication for Pancreatic Cancer from Maitake Extract, which is named as ABV-1703 and out licensed to it Rgene for the preparation of its IND application with the FDA. On August 25, 2017, ABV-1703’s Phase II trial was approved by FDA. Pursuant to the ABVC-Rgene Co-development Agreement, ABVC is responsible for coordinating and conducting the clinical trials of ABV-1703 globally and Rgene shall prepare the related FDA applications. As of the date of this annual report, we are engaging with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the U.S. to conduct the phase II clinical trial and plan to initiate the phase II trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. We plan to submit ABV-1703’s phase II clinical trial IND to Taiwan FDA after we commence the clinical trials in the United States.  
 

VI. | ABV-1601 Treating Depression in Cancer Patients 
----+----------------------------------------------------

 
We developed the treatment of depression in cancer patient indication from the same API of ABV-1504. Also ABV-1601 shares the similar pharmaceutical mechanism of action of ABV-1504 inasmuch that ABV-1601 shows the potential of increasing the level of norepinephrine in human’s nervous system by inhibiting its reabsorption. Because of ABV-1601’s sufficient similarity with ABV-1504, the FDA approved our ABV-1601-001 clinical protocol under IND 112567 (the same IND for ABV-1504) in December 2018.

For the Phase II trial, ABVC plans to recruit a maximum number of 54 cancer patients with depression, to whom ABVC intends to administer ABV-1601 oral capsules. ABVC is engaging the Principal Investigator at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the U.S. which designed a randomized, double-blind dose escalation study with a comparator-controlled group to assess the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1601, primarily against Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. The primary endpoint of the Phase II trial is change in MADRS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and subscales (HADS-A and HADS-D), and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) total scores from baseline in patients taking PDC-1421 compared to the comparator. As of the date of this report, the Part I clinical protocol, which is an open trial, has been submitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IRB Committee for review and approval. 
 
Collaboration Agreement with BioFirst and ABV-1701 Vitreous Substitute for Vitrectom


On July 24, 2017, BriVision, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a collaboration agreement (the “BioFirst Agreement”) with BioFirst Corporation (“BioFirst”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Taiwan, pursuant to which BioFirst granted BriVision the global license to co-develop BFC-1401 Vitreous Substitute for Vitrectom (“BFC-1401”) for medical purposes. BioFirst is a related party to the Company because BioFirst and Yuangene Corporation (“Yuangene”), the Company’s controlling shareholder, are under common control of the controlling beneficiary shareholder of Yuangene.
 
According to the BioFirst Agreement, we co-develop and commercialize BFC-1401 or ABV-1701 with BioFirst and are obligated to pay BioFirst $3,000,000 (the “Total Payment”) in cash or common stock of the Company on or before September 30, 2018 in two installments. An upfront payment of $300,000, representing 10% of the Total Payment due under the Collaboration Agreement, shall be paid upon execution of the Collaboration Agreement. The Company is entitled to receive 50% of the future net licensing income or net sales profit when ABV-1701 is sublicensed or commercialized. For more information about the BioFirst Agreement, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K filed on July 24, 2017. As of date of this report, the Company has not made the payment of $3,000,000 to BioFirst.
 
On November 7, 2016, the application of phase I clinical trial prepared and submitted by BioFirst was approved by Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia (“HREC”), and on November 14, 2016, it was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia (“TGA”).
 
We successfully finished the Phase I clinical trial of ABV-1701 at Sydney Retina Clinic and Day Surgery, a clinic located in Sydney, Australia. This was the only site for this Phase I clinical trial. The trial started on November 17, 2016, and was completed with positive results in July 2018. The Protocol Title is “A Phase I, single center, safety and tolerability study of Vitargus in the treatment of Retinal Detachment.”
 
The primary endpoint of this phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal dose of Vitargus in patients as a vitreous substitute during vitrectomy surgery for retinal detachment. Intravitreal is a route of administration of a drug or other substance, in which the substance is delivered into the eyes. The secondary endpoint of this phase I clinical trial is to assess retinal attachment and Virtagus degradation at day 90 and to assess best corrected visual acuity (“BVCA”) after vitrectomy surgery. BVCA refers to the best possible vision a person can achieve. The primary and second endpoints are required by HREC for the purpose of evaluation of our Phase I clinical trial application. We enrolled an aggregate number of 10 patient subjects in this trial. On November 17, 2016, we received the approval from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for the first subject, and nine (9) more subjects were enrolled thereafter. In this trial, Vitargus was injected into the vitreous cavity of vitrectomised eyes, whose vitreous gel was removed from the vitreous cavity after a vitrectomy surgery. Currently, we are in the process of preparing the final clinical study report for the Phase I trial.
 
Meanwhile, we are planning the pivotal study for ABV-1701 which is the next step after the successful completion of the Phase I clinical trial and the necessary step to obtain the Premarket Approval for this device. The pivotal study for ABV-1701 is designed to be a multi-nation and multi-site clinical trial involving several countries, including Australia, the U.S.A., Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and People’s Republic of China.

Control Release Technologies
 
ABVC through BioKey, has developed the proprietary control release systems that may delay the release of drugs into human bodies at various controlled paces. ABVC has at least ten more drugs in the company’s development pipeline for instance, BK102 Metaxalone to treat skeletal muscle pain or injury and BK503 Clarithromycin XR for the purpose of treating bacterial infections. In addition to the existing development in the pipeline, ABVC is reviewing potential drug candidates for potential licensing and co-development opportunities. ABVC focuses on the drug candidates that meet one or more of the following criteria:

● | Niche market potential; 
--+----------------------------


● | Reliable control of API sources with DMF(Drug Master File) readily in place; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive pricing for the APIs; 
--+--------------------------------------


● | High development barrier; 
--+------------------------------


● | Strategic co-development with distributors; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Feasible with the Company’s skill sets and facility capacity 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
NDA Products
 
BK501: ABVC through BioKey has developed a new controlled release dosage form of an immediate release antithrombotic drug which has high frequency of side effects. BK501 will vastly improve patient compliance by reducing side effects. Through this joint venture, ABVC will pass portion of financial burden to our strategic alliance and expand its product market to Asia.
 
BK502: ABVC through BioKey has acquired exclusive right of the U.S. patent application for BK502 from a Delaware corporation which has developed a novel multi-component anti-diabetes drug that significantly improves both blood glucose and lipid profiles. This product is based primarily on Metformin, an oral anti-hyperglycemic drug used in the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, currently marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the trade name of Glucophage. Metformin lowers blood sugar by keeping the liver from making too much sugar. However, most type 2 diabetics have problems not only with blood sugar but also with high cholesterol and triglycerides. BK502 is designed to lower not only the blood sugar but also lower the fatty blood components—triglycerides and cholesterol in the patient.

Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy/Business Plan
 
ABVC’s research and development department aims to translating the laboratory research results to new drug candidates ready for Phase III clinical trials together with its CDMO SBU. Botanical products may be classified as foods, dietary supplements, drugs, medical devices or cosmetics, depending on their “intended use.” There is a fine line separating drugs from foods and dietary supplements. We focus primarily on developing botanical drugs, which by definition are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation or treatment of disease in humans. Together with ABVC’s strategic partners, it plans to market, distribute and sell its drug products internationally, in areas such as the United States, Canada and Japan. ABVC needs to have the drug candidates comply with the local authorities regulating drugs and foods, for example the FDA and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (“TFDA”), in order to market our drug products in the respective areas. Currently, a lot of countries follow the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (the “ICH”) guidelines that are published by the European Medicines to provide guidance on quality and safety of pharmaceutical development and new drug commercialization among Japan, the United States and Europe. Based on ABVC’s new drug development experience, ABVC made a strategic decision to have its drug candidates go through the FDA process for new drug development first and then seek regulatory approvals on the FDA approved drugs from the authorities equivalent to the FDA in the jurisdictions where ABVC plans to market its new drug products.
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our drug candidates possess their respective competitive advantages over other therapeutic products that are currently available. However, due to limited information and resources, we cannot compare our drug candidates with all other drug candidates under development and research by other research institutions and/or biopharmaceutical companies.
 
The competitive advantages of our business model include:
 
1. Once we successfully complete POC of any product in the pipeline, we will seek strategic partners, such as respected pharmaceutical companies in the United States and boutique qualified clinics, to co-develop such mature product. In consideration for our licensing of the mature product, we expect to receive capital which we plan to use for our research and development of other products in the pipeline or selection of other new drugs or medical devices.
 
2. Sublicensing our products that pass Phase II clinic trials to other pharmaceutical companies saves us the time and resources to conduct Phase III clinical trials and provides a quicker return on our investment in our products.
 
3. We have new drug products related to central nervous system, cancers and autoimmune and one new medical device for vitreous substitutes under development. This development portfolio diversifies our research risks by focusing on three different medical fields.
 
We are currently negotiating with potential medical center partners regarding conducting clinical trials on certain compounds in our pipeline. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will find a qualified medical center to conduct clinical trials of any of our new drug products or enter into a definitive licensing agreement with any pharmaceutical companies.

Government Regulation
 
Regulations by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries are a significant factor in developing manufacturing and marketing of our pharmaceutical products. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us may vary depending on the nature of our products. We anticipate that many, if not all, of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Our products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA, and similar regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence clinical trials, Chemistry, Manufacture and Control (CMC) related to such products and their marketing. The approval process and subsequent compliance with related statutes and regulations require substantial time and capital commitment, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted.

U.S. FDA Approval Process and other U.S. Regulatory Authorities 
 
Prior to commencement of clinical studies, pre-clinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in laboratories to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the new drug candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as a part of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical trials. Typically, clinical trials involve a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. Phase I clinical trials are conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to establish a safety pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within subjects’ bodies. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease that the new drug is designed to treat in order to determine preliminary efficacy, possible dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial clinical trial is conducted on diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case such trial is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted on patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing; and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to a point whereby the risk/benefit ratio of the new drug candidate is below a certain level. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA.
 
The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing on a non-biologic drug and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or refuse to approve if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. There can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the treatment of oocyte donors, the manufacturing environment under which human cells for therapy are derived, safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents. We cannot accurately predict the influence on our research operations caused by regulatory changes.
 
European and Other Regulatory Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries will likely be necessary prior to commencement of marketing such product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before approving it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. The regulatory authorities in the European Union (“EU”), Australia and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining an approval in a particular country may vary from the process in another country, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.
Employees
 
As of April 8, 2019, we, including the subsidiaries, have thirty-eight employees, located in the U.S. and Taiwan. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
