ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND
 
We were incorporated on January 16, 2008 under the laws of the state of Nevada as Plethora Resources Inc. to commence operations in the business of consulting to oil & gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. We were unable to fund our intended business and, on May 28, 2009 but effective February 1, 2009, we acquired a wholly owned subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd, for the assumption of the debts of Sync2 Agency Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sync2 International Ltd. Sync2 Agency Ltd is an internet marketing and website development company.
 
On May 14, 2009 we changed our name to Sync2 Networks Corp. On December 15, 2009, we shut down the operations of Sync2 Agency Ltd. after incurring substantial operating losses, and subsequently wrote-off the investment in Sync2 Agency Ltd. 
 
At the end of 2009 Sync2 International Ltd, became inactive and Sync2 Agency Ltd. was liquidated.
 
Domestication of Subsidiary
 
On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (the “Domestication”), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. As part of the process of domestication of Sync 2 International Ltd, we recognized $516,245 of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from the write off of the remaining assets and liabilities of Sync 2 International Ltd,
 
Sync2 International Ltd, was still inactive at May 3, 2019 (the date of filing).
 
FINRA Corporate Action/Information Statement on Form 14C
 
On October 9, 2013, our Board of Directors and majority shareholders approved a reverse stock split of one for one thousand (1:1,000) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Stock Split”) and a change in our name from “Sync2 Networks Corp.” to “T-REX Acquisition Corp.” (the “Name Change”). Pursuant to our Bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of the Company’s outstanding votes was required to effect the Stock Split and the Name Change. Our articles of incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. As of the record date of October 9, 2013, we had 103,046,175 voting shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The consenting stockholders of the shares of common stock were entitled to 62,863,800 votes, which represented approximately 61.0% of the voting rights associated with our shares of common stock. The consenting stockholders voted in favor of the Stock Split and the Name Change described herein in a unanimous written consent dated October 9, 2013. An information statement on Form 14(c) was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 11, 2013.

On December 11, 2013, we filed an Information Statement on Form 14(c) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was furnished to all holders of our common stock as of October 9, 2013, in connection with the action taken by written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company to authorize the following: (i) ratification of an amendment to the articles of incorporation (the “Name Change Amendment”) to change our name from “Sync2 Networks Corp.” to “T-REX Acquisition Corp.” (the “Name Change”); and (vi) ratification of a reverse stock split of one for one thousand (1:1,000) of our shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”).
 
The name of the shareholder of record who holds in the aggregate a majority of our total issued and outstanding common stock and who signed the written consent of stockholders was Warren Gilbert holding of record 62,863,800 shares of common stock (61%).
 
These actions were approved by written consent on October 9, 2013 by our Board of Directors and a majority of holders of our voting capital stock, in accordance with Nevada Revised Statutes. Our directors and majority of the shareholders of our outstanding capital stock, as of the record date of October 9, 2013.have approved the Name Change Amendment and the Reverse Split as determined were in the best interests of our Company and shareholders.
 
The Board of Directors had previously considered factors regarding their approval of the Stock Split including, but not limited to: (i) current trading price of our shares of common stock on the OTC QB Market and potential to increase the marketability and liquidity of our common stock; (ii) possible reluctance of brokerage firms and institutional investors to recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients or to hold in their own portfolios; (iii) desire to meet future requirements of per-share price and net tangible assets and shareholders’ equity relating to admission for trading on other markets; and (iv) posturing us and our structure in favorable position in order to effectively negotiate with potential acquisition candidates regarding assets. Our Board of Directors approved the Name Change and the Stock Split and recommended our majority shareholders review and approve the Name Change and the Stock Split.
 
The Stock Split was effected based upon the filing of appropriate documentation with FINRA. The Stock Split decreased our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 103,046,175 shares to 103,046 shares of common stock. The common stock will continue to be $0.001 par value. Our trading symbol changed to “TRXA”. The new cusip number for the Company is 89532J 108. All common stock references in this filing are post-split figures, unless otherwise identified.
 
The Name Change was effected to better reflect our future business operations.
 
All common stock references are post reverse split figures unless specifically identified otherwise.
 
Change in Control
 
On approximately August 14, 2013, there was a change in our control. In accordance with the terms and provisions of that certain escrow agreement dated March 31, 2012 (the “Escrow Agreement”), Warren Gilbert, who was at the time the current President/Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer/Chief Financial Officer and sole member of the Board of Directors, acquired in a private transaction an aggregate of 62,863,800 shares of our restricted common stock representing an equity interest of 61% of the total issued and outstanding shares. The amount of consideration paid was $325,000 and were outside funds from unrelated parties. The shares of common stock were acquired as follows: (i) 51,000,000 shares from Artur Etozov; and (ii) 11,863,800 shares from approximately ten separate shareholders each holding less than 5% of the total issued and outstanding.
