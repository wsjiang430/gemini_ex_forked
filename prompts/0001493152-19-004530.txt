ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc. (“Intellinetics”), is a Nevada holding company incorporated in 1997, with a single operating subsidiary, Intellinetics, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Intellinetics Ohio,” together with Intellinetics, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization.
 
The Company is a document solutions software development, sales and marketing company serving both the public and private sectors. The Company’s software platform allows customers to capture and manage all documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and all digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. The Company’s solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the processes they drive by making them easy to find, secure and compliant with its customers’ audit requirements.
 
Customers obtain use of the Company’s software by either purchasing for installation onto their equipment, referred to as a “premise” model, or by accessing the platform via the Internet, referred to as a “cloud-based” or “software as a service” (“SaaS”) model. The Company anticipates that the provision of “cloud” application services, or SaaS cloud-based customer activation, will increase over time and become a growing priority in the market and is the most significant strategic part of its revenue growth opportunity. Our SaaS products are hosted with Amazon Web Services and Expedient, offering our customers reliable hosting services with best practices in data security.
 
Software and Services
 
Our flagship software platform is IntelliCloudTM, reflecting the Company and market focus on growth via cloud-based managed document service delivery. The Company also provides professional services that include installation, integration, training, and consulting services as well as ongoing software maintenance and customer support.
 
The four primary components of the IntelliCloudTM solution are as follows:
 

● | Image Processing: includes image processing modules used for capturing, transforming and managing images of paper documents, including support of distributed and high-volume capture, optical character recognition; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Records Management: addresses needs relating to retention of content through automation and policies, ensuring legal, regulatory and industry compliance for our clients; 
● | Workflow: supports business processes, routing content electronically, assigning work tasks and states (e.g., reviews or approvals, including incident case management), and creating related audit trails; 
● | Extended Components: includes document composition and e-forms (via third party OEM integration partnership), search, content and web analytics (via third party Advanced OCR engine partnership), email and information archiving, packaged application integration, and advanced capture for invoice processing.

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has a multi-channel sales model that directs our sales efforts toward both sales through intermediaries, such as software developers and resellers and multi- function device resellers, and through direct sales. We have developed marketing programs with resellers and distributors (collectively, “Resellers”) that facilitate their selling and support of our software solutions. We believe that our Reseller strategy improvements have increased the competitive strength of our platform of products. In addition, we have established a set of business solutions templates for specific vertical markets that provide base software configurations which we believe will facilitate our delivery and installation of software to our customers. We believe that these advancements, in the aggregate, will allow us to license and sell our products to a targeted customer base, shortening our sales cycle, making margins more consistent, and allowing us to expand our sales through existing and new Reseller partnerships and direct customers. We continue to devote significant efforts, in both development and marketing, in enhancing all channels to market.
Competition and Market Position
 
The market for our products is competitive, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify as the document solutions markets evolve and potentially consolidate. We believe our primary competitors in our market, primarily the small-to-medium business (SMB) sector, are DocuWare, Square 9, and M-files. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products and services include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
 
We believe that the Company has advantages over our competitors in the small-to-medium business market. In our view, the Company will remain competitive by remaining a focused niche provider with product offerings aligned with buyer-specific requirements. We anticipate that Intellinetics will benefit from four specific advantages already in place:
 

● | Turnkey cloud or premise document workflow solutions targeting specific industry customers with benchmark value-to-price ratio; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Modular solution packaging and rapid customer activation model; 
● | Integrated on-demand solutions library as standard platform feature; and 
● | Proprietary AuditShieldTM compliance management module as a standard platform feature providing customers with a simple way to know if documents required by law or policy are missing. 

 
We believe, with these competitive strengths, that Intellinetics is well positioned as a cloud-based managed document services provider for the small-to-medium business sector.
 
Customers
 
Revenues from the Company’s services to a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of the Company’s total revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s three largest customers, Tiburon, Inc., a Reseller, Mid-Ohio Strategic Technologies, a reseller, and Laser Systems, Inc., a reseller, accounted for approximately 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues for that period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s two largest customers, Ohio Department of Commerce, a direct client, and Tiburon, Inc., a Reseller, accounted for approximately 10%, each, of the Company’s revenues for that period.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, government contracts represented approximately 30% and 41% of the Company’s net revenues, respectively. A significant portion of the Company’s sales to Resellers represent ultimate sales to government agencies. Due to their dependence on state, local and federal budgets, government contracts carry short terms, typically less than 18 months. Since our inception, our contracts with government customers have generally renewed on the original terms and conditions upon expiration.

Intellectual Property
 
Our software and most of the underlying technologies are built on a Microsoft.Net framework. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary intellectual property rights.
 
Customers license the right to use our software products on a non-exclusive basis. We grant to third parties rights in our intellectual property that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product or to a particular geographic area.
 
While we believe that our intellectual property as a whole is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business. Other than government procurement rules affecting sales to governmental customers, we do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations or approval requirements affecting our products or services. Complying with the regulations and requirements applicable to our business does not entail a significant cost or burden. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.
Research and Development
 
We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products. Recent examples of significant trends in the software industry include cloud computing, mobility, social media, and Software as a Service. We continuously monitor our software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. We expense our software development costs as incurred.
