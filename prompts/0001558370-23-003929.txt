Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of antibiotics for infections caused by bacteria listed as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (“WHO”), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Priority pathogens are those which require new antibiotics to address the worldwide crisis of antimicrobial resistance (“AMR”) as identified by the WHO, CDC and FDA. The CDC estimates that, in the U.S., antibiotic-resistant pathogens infect one individual every 11 seconds and result in one death every 15 minutes. The WHO recently stated that growing antimicrobial resistance is equally as dangerous as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and may leave us defenseless against infections that today can be treated easily. According to the WHO, the current clinical development pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of the increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
Our approach is to develop a new class of antibiotic candidates that block the DNA polymerase IIIC enzyme (“Pol IIIC”). We believe we are developing the first Pol IIIC inhibitor to enter clinical trials and have clinically validated the efficacy of our lead Pol IIIC antibiotic candidate in a Phase 2a clinical trial. Pol IIIC is the primary catalyst for DNA replication of several Gram-positive bacterial cells. Our research and development pipeline includes clinical stage and early stage antibiotic candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria for oral and/or parenteral treatment of infections caused by Clostridium difficile (“C. difficile”), Enterococcus (including vancomycin-resistant strains (“VRE”)), Staphylococcus (including methicillin-resistant strains (“MRSA”)), and Streptococcus (including antibiotic resistant strains).
Pol IIIC is required for the replication of DNA in certain Gram-positive bacterial species. By blocking this enzyme, our antibiotic candidates are believed to be bactericidal and inhibit proliferation of several common Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including both sensitive and resistant C. difficile, MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (“PRSP”) and other resistant bacteria.
We intend to “de-risk” this new class of antibiotics through our drug development activities and potentially partner with a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company for late-stage clinical trials and commercialization.
Our lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat (formerly named ACX-362E), has a novel mechanism of action that targets the Pol IIIC enzyme, a previously unexploited scientific target. Phase 2a clinical data validate the efficacy of our lead antibiotic candidate as well as Pol IIIC as an appropriate bacterial target. On December 3, 2021, we commenced enrollment in a Phase 2b 64-patient, randomized (1-to1), non-inferiority, double-blind trial of oral ibezapolstat compared to oral vancomycin, a standard of care to treat C. difficile infections (“CDI”).
Prior to that, we completed our Phase 2a clinical trial of ibezapolstat to treat patients with CDI and reported the top-line data in November 2020. The Phase 2a clinical trial was terminated early based upon the recommendation of our Scientific Advisory Board (the “SAB”). The SAB reviewed the study data presented by management, including adverse events and efficacy outcomes, and discussed its clinical impressions. The SAB unanimously supported the early termination of the Phase 2a trial after 10 patients were enrolled in the trial instead of 20 patients as originally planned. The early termination was further based on the evidence of meeting the treatment goals of eliminating the infection with an acceptable adverse event profile.
The SAB noted that 10 out of 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial reached the Clinical Cure endpoint, defined in the study protocol as the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before the end-of-treatment that is maintained for 48 hours after end of treatment. Such cure was sustained, meaning that the patients showed no sign of infection recurrence, for 30 days thereafter. This constitutes a 100% response rate for the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial. All 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial met the study’s primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, namely, Clinical Cure at end of treatment and Sustained Clinical Cure of no recurrence of CDI at the 28-day

follow-up visit. No treatment-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) were reported by the investigators who enrolled patients in the trial. We believe these results represent the first-ever clinical data showing Pol IIIC has potential as a therapeutically-relevant antibacterial target. Our Phase 2b clinical trial commenced enrollment on December 3, 2021.
The SAB is comprised of seven scientists and clinicians who have significant expertise in the scientific disciplines required for the research and development of antibiotics. The members of the SAB serve at the pleasure of management, are paid in cash on an hourly basis for their services and do not receive equity compensation. Generally, the SAB is consulted by management during the process of designing our preclinical and clinical trials as well as in the process of analyzing data generated from these trials, although the SAB’s services are not limited to such activities.
Currently available antibiotics used to treat CDI infections utilize other mechanisms of action. We believe ibezapolstat is the first antibiotic candidate to work by blocking the DNA Pol IIIC enzyme in C. difficile. This enzyme is necessary for replication of the DNA of certain Gram-positive bacteria, like C. difficile.
We also have an early-stage pipeline of antibiotic product candidates with the same previously unexploited mechanism of action which has established proof of concept in animal studies. This pipeline includes ACX-375C, a potential oral and parenteral treatment targeting Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA, VRE and PRSP.
Our Technology
The results of our Phase 2a clinical trial also represent the first-ever clinical validation of DNA polymerase IIIC as a therapeutically relevant antibacterial target. Ibezapolstat was very well tolerated with no treatment-related SAEs noted in the Phase 2a trial. Additionally, data obtained to date demonstrate that ibezapolstat enhances actinobacteria in the microbiome and suppresses regrowth of proteobacteria; potentially lessening the likelihood of CDI recurrence or new infection by MDR Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the unexpected finding from further analysis of the Phase 2a study is that the beneficial Firmicutes were shown to regrow while patients were receiving ibezapolstat therapy. Several follow-up experiments have demonstrated that many of these beneficial Firmicutes have heterogeneous susceptibility to ibezapolstat allowing them to continue to perform their beneficial biologic functions even while a patient is receiving ibezapolstat for their C. difficile infection. (Garey, Oral Presentation, IDSA, IDWeek 2022 Conference, Oct 19-23, 2022). 

Prior to conducting the Phase 2a clinical trial, we successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ibezapolstat for the oral treatment of CDI (the “Phase 1 Trial”). The Phase 1 Trial, conducted in the U.S., was a double-blind, placebo- controlled study to determine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (“PK”) and fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat in 62 healthy volunteers. It was conducted in two parts; first, single ascending doses were administered to four cohorts of eight subjects each, and second, multiple ascending doses were administered that simulate the anticipated clinical treatment regimen. Safety information was analyzed through assessment of adverse events and other standard safety measures, while concentrations of ibezapolstat were determined in both blood and the feces, the latter being the critical site of drug delivery for treating CDI. In addition, the laboratory of Dr. Kevin Garey at the University of Houston performed state-

4



of-the-art microbiomic testing of gastrointestinal flora in trial subjects as compared with vancomycin, the standard of care for the treatment of patients with CDI, which testing was the first of its kind in Phase 1 clinical trials for CDI.
Data from the case report forms completed by the principal investigators of the Phase I Trial showed that single and multiple ascending doses of ibezapolstat demonstrated a safety signal similar to placebo according to the principal investigators as evidenced by the case report forms. There were no safety signals reported on the case report forms related to physical examination or vital signs (blood pressure, pulse or oral temperature) in any part of the study. No significant abnormalities developed in the 12-lead electrocardiogram traces for any subject at any dose given according to the data reported by the principal investigators in the case report forms. No changes were observed in serum biochemistry or hematological blood evaluations. No dose-dependent increase in adverse events, (each, an “AE”) was reported, and no serious AEs were observed. The proportion of ibezapolstat-dosed subjects with an AE was similar to placebo at each dosing level. All AEs were considered mild or moderate and none required a change in therapy or intervention.
Systemic exposure following oral dosing was very low and no accumulation occurred after ten days of repeated dosing. In addition, oral dosing of ibezapolstat resulted in rapid and sustained fecal concentrations that are approximately 2,500 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of ibezapolstat required to kill the CDI bacteria in the colon at the site of the infection. Comparative microbiome analysis versus vancomycin demonstrated a two to three log favorable difference in the reduction of the predominantly healthy bacteria in the gut microbiome. Free concentrations of ibezapolstat were found to be high enough to kill C. difficile but too low to kill healthy bacteria like Bacteroides & Firmicutes which constitute approximately 90% of healthy microbiome in the judgment of our scientific advisors. Upon review of the final Phase 1 Trial data, our medical and scientific advisors suggested these data supported advancing ibezapolstat into a Phase 2 clinical trial at doses up to 450 mg, twice daily, for 10 days of treatment, as described above. We believe that ibezapolstat is the only clinical-stage compound currently known to target C. difficile by acting specifically on Pol IIIC.
We have worked closely with the FDA to obtain our investigational new drug application (“IND”), and to obtain FDA fast track designation as well as designation of ibezapolstat as a qualified infectious disease product (“QIDP”), which provides incentives through the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”) including FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP, fast track designation eligibility and extension of statutory exclusivity periods in the U.S. for an additional 5 years upon FDA marketing approval of the product to treat patients with CDI.
Ibezapolstat originally was sponsored by GLSynthesis Inc., which completed several pre-clinical studies, developed the current manufacturing process and filed for several of the patents that have been granted to date. We acquired worldwide rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize ibezapolstat from GLSynthesis Inc. on February 5, 2018, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement executed by the parties on that date. At closing, we paid GLSynthesis $110,174 in cash and 100,000 Class B Membership Interests. We are also required to pay up to $700,000 in success-based clinical milestone payments to GLSynthesis, including a payment of $500,000 upon the successful completion of two phase 3 clinical trials and a royalty of 4% on net sales of ibezapolstat throughout the duration of the patent period, which currently extends to September 2030.
As of the date of this Form 10-K, of the $700,000 of potential milestone payments, we have paid to GLSynthesis a total of $50,000, including $25,000 paid upon receipt of a “safe to proceed” notification from FDA relating to the commencement of clinical trials (December 2018) and $25,000 paid upon the successful completion of clinical trial drug supply suitable to support our Phase 1 clinical trial (December 2018). The patent jurisdictions of the acquired patents include the U.S., European Union, Japan and Canada.
About QIDP and Fast Track Designations
The GAIN Act, which was enacted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) in 2012, created incentives for the development of novel antibiotic and antifungal products intended to treat serious and life-threatening infections. The GAIN Act amended the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to add a designation for QIDPs. A QIDP is defined as “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious 

5



or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or infectious pathogens, or (2) qualifying pathogens listed under” 21 C.F.R. § 317.2. The primary incentive for developing a QIDP is a five-year exclusivity extension for the relevant antibiotic or antifungal indications of the QIDP, but the designation also offers FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP and eligibility for fast track designation.
FDA’s fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatory pathway of new drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that fill a high unmet medical need. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the new drug application (“NDA”) for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.
Based upon advice from our scientific advisors, we believe ACX-375C, our second antibiotic candidate currently in pre-clinical development, will also be eligible for FDA’s QIDP and fast track designations. This advice is supported by the “qualifying” criteria for a QIDP listed in GAIN Act legislation of 2012 enacted as part of the FDASIA. A QIDP is defined as “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by qualifying pathogens listed under 21 C.F.R. § 317.2 which include bacterial pathogens against which ACX-375C has demonstrated microbiological activity namely, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. These bacteria are generally causative of serious or life-threatening infections, including, but not limited to, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, community acquired pneumonia, blood stream infections, hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator acquired bacterial pneumonia, which are planned to be studied in future clinical trials at the appropriate time in product development.
Mechanism of Action
DNA Pol IIIC has proved essential for replicative DNA synthesis in aerobic, low G-C Gram-positive bacteria, i.e. those with a low guanine-cytosine (G-C) ratio relative to their adenine-thymine (A-T) ratio. Pol IIIC-specific genes of several such Gram-positive bacteria have been cloned and expressed, and the DNA Pol IIIC enzymes appear to share a unique capacity to be inhibited by 6-anilinouracils (AU), 2-phenylguanines (PG) and related compounds which are analogs of 2 ‘-deoxyguanosine 5’ -triphosphate (dGTP).
The hypothesis supporting further development of ibezapolstat is that dGTP analog compounds bind to Pol IIIC via a “base-pairing domain” and an enzyme-specific “aryl domain” (Figure 1). Through its base-pairing domain, which mimics that of guanine, the dGTP analog base pairs with an un-apposed template cytosine just distal to the DNA primer terminus. Simultaneously, the aryl domain binds an aryl-specific “receptor” near the POL IIIC enzyme’s dNTP binding site, causing the formation of an inactive ternary complex of inhibitor (dGTP analog), DNA and Pol IIIC (Figure 2).

Following the ternary binding hypothesis described above, Torti et al. (2011) reported that ibezapolstat (362E) inhibited purified Pol IIIC derived from C. difficile (Ki 0.325 µM) and from Bacillus subtilis (Ki 0.34 µM) in in vitro resting. C. difficile has a single circular chromosome and one origin of replication (oriC) from which DNA replication begins in a bi-directional fashion (Figure 3A). Using marker frequency analysis, the abundance of the oriC proximal genes relative to the terminus (terC) proximal genes can be determined. C. difficile treated with 4 µg/mL of ibezapolstat (362E) demonstrated an 8-16-fold increased oriC:terC ratio, which would be expected for inhibition of DNA replication (Figure 3B).

Leiden University Medical Center/Health Holland Research Project
In August 2021, Health Holland awarded a grant of approximately $500,000 USD to Leiden University Medical Center (“LUMC”) to further study the mechanism of action of pol IIIC inhibitors in a consortium partnership with our 

7



Company (the “Health Holland Research Project”). This innovative research project entitled “Bad bugs, new drugs: Elucidation of the Structure of DNA Polymerase C (PolC) of Multidrug Resistant Bacteria in Complex with Novel Classes of Antimicrobials (POLSTOP2)” will study 3-dimensional structures of DNA polymerases and their binding interactions with our inhibitors. The antibacterial molecular target of our pipeline of novel DNA pol IIIC inhibitors has been clinically validated by ibezapolstat’s recent completion of a Phase 2a trial in patients with CDI. The Health Holland Research Project is intended to accelerate lead product candidate selection for our ACX-375 program for systemic treatment against multidrug resistant bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Drug-Resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae (DRSP) and for other WHO, CDC and FDA high-priority, drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens where new classes of antibiotics are needed. This project was initiated by LUMC in September 2021 and emerging data are expected to contribute to the ACX-375C program development.

Pharmacokinetics
Administration in male rats of a 5 mg/kg IV bolus dose of a salt form of GLS362E showed rapid systemic clearance and a short terminal half-life (0.34 hours). Plasma concentrations were BQL (<0.5ng/mL) at three to four hours post-dose. All oral dosing of GLS362E, now known as ibezapolstat, did not use the salt form, only the parent molecule since the salt form is not necessary for oral dosing. Administration in male rats of a single 50mg/kg oral dose of ibezapolstat in a suspension formulation, Cmax was 119ng/mL and was observed at 15 minutes post-dose. Plasma levels declined with an apparent terminal half — life of 3.82 hours and were still quantifiable at 24 hours post-dose. Oral bioavailability in 

8



male rats was 8.6%. Ibezapolstat excretion in feces was much greater than urinary excretion, consistent with incomplete oral bioavailability. After administration in male rats of a single 50 mg/kg oral dose of ibezapolstat in a suspension formulation, concentrations in the GI mucosa of all regions of the gastrointestinal tract were >10µg/mL at four hours post-dose, and >10 µg/mL at ten hours post-dose for ileum, cecum, colon and rectum. Fecal concentrations after oral dosing were approximately 100 to 200 mcg/mL.
In vitro Microbiology
Several in vitro susceptibility tests have been completed. Below is a summary data table showing MIC values for 22 C. difficile strains, conducted in triplicate, with the testing conducted by the R.M. Alden Laboratory in California and the isolates obtained from the same. The table below shows that the activity of GLS362E was similar to that of vancomycin and metronidazole.

Data in the table below show that ibezapolstat was not active against two Bifidobacterium species or Eubacterium lentum at 32 µg/mL, the highest concentration tested. Activity was observed for lactobacilli and Clostridium perfringens. Most importantly, ibezapolstat was active against ten clinical isolates of C. difficile with an MIC range of 0.5 – 4 µg/mL, MIC50 of 2 µg/mL, and an MIC90 of 4 µg/mL. Since the Pol IIIC target enzyme is present in only a narrow spectrum of Gram-positive organisms, minimal disruption of gut flora is anticipated. This is supported by the data in the table below, which shows that representative specimens of other gut bacteria — lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and eubacterium — are not susceptible to ibezapolstat.

Additional testing has shown that ibezapolstat is highly potent against 98 strains of recent clinical isolates of C. difficile in the U.S., with an MIC50 of 2 µg/mL and an MIC90 of 4 µg/mL, as shown in the table below. Similar recent testing of 364 European isolates showed identical MIC values.

The in vitro activity of ibezapolstat was tested in June 2019 by conducting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing against 104 C. difficile clinical isolates, including those with important ribotypes. Fidaxomicin, vancomycin, and metronidazole were used as comparators. When ibezapolstat achieved the ≥99.9% bacterial kill (i.e., 3-log reduction in bacterial numbers), it met the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (“CLSI”) criteria for bactericidal activity which is accepted by FDA. This represents a laboratory measure of antibacterial potency but does not translate directly into human efficacy which can only be established in clinical trials.
Results indicated that the activity of ibezapolstat was similar to that of the comparators evaluated, with a narrow MIC range against 104 C. difficile clinical isolates, of which ~30% were of different ribotypes and another 30% were toxigenic. In addition, 4 isolates of the epidemic strain ribotypes 027 and 078 demonstrated ACX-362E sensitivities similar to those of other ribotypes.

Overall, the results of this study indicated that the activity of ibezapolstat was similar to that of the comparators evaluated in this study. With a narrow MIC range against 104 C. difficile clinical isolates, approximately 30% were of different ribotypes and another 30% were toxigenic.

In July 2019 the bactericidal activity of ibezapolstat was evaluated by first determining the MIC and then the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against 3 C. difficile isolates; vancomycin and metronidazole were used as comparators in these assays. In a second measure of bactericidal activity, the time-kill kinetics of ibezapolstat was assessed in comparison to vancomycin and metronidazole against the same 3 C. difficile isolates.
Against two of the three isolates, ibezapolstat had MBC:MIC ratios of 1 to 4 across replicates indicating bactericidal activity. For the remaining isolate, MBC:MIC ratios of 2 to >8 were observed although in instances where the ratio was >8, counts indicated >2-log10 killing at or near the MIC. When the time-kill kinetics (or the result of a microbiological laboratory study of antimicrobial activity of a compound over time) of ibezapolstat were evaluated against C. difficile MMX 5680 and BAA-1382, bactericidal activity was observed at the two later time points and at all three evaluated doses (MMX 5680) or the two highest doses (BAA-1382). Against C. difficile isolate BAA-1875, ibezapolstat did not demonstrate the ≥3 log10 CFU/mL killing required for bactericidal activity, but bacterial levels were reduced by >2 log10 CFU at the 24- and 48-hour time points at 16X and 32X the MIC. In the case of metronidazole and vancomycin, the highest MIC value recorded from the triplicate testing was used to calculate 8X, 16X, and 32X the MIC for the time kill study.

Nonclinical data indicate that ibezapolstat demonstrates reproducible and consistent in vitro potency against C. difficile and is comparable to vancomycin in the standard and predictive Syrian Golden Hamster model of CDI. The nonclinical data also indicate that ibezapolstat may be active against C. difficile in the human colon, and in fact, ibezapolstat concentrations reached approximately 2,500-fold greater than the MIC needed to kill the C. difficile in this Phase 1 first-in-man clinical trial.
In vivo Efficacy Animal Models
GLS-362E (and GLS-359E) were studied in vivo in the golden Syrian hamster model of C. difficile-induced colitis. Both compounds had low GI absorption (<5% of an oral dose of 75 mg/kg was absorbed) and low toxicity (up to 1,000 mg/kg in hamsters). In the in vivo model, hamsters are first treated subcutaneously with clindamycin, followed 24 h later with ~107 CFU of C. difficile spores administered orally; therapy was initiated ~17 hours post-infection. Initial experiments evaluated the efficacy of the two compounds in this model (Dvoskin, et al, 2012, AAC) with studies designed to optimize the dose and length of therapy. In experiment 1 (shown in Table 2, below), treatment was given twice daily for three days with either vancomycin (50 mg/kg),

​
GLS-359E or GLS-362E (GLS-359E and GLS-362E dosed at 50, 25, 12.5, or 6.25 mg/kg), with survivorship followed through 120 hours. 362E was found to be more efficacious at lower doses than GLS-359E: 6.25 mg/kg of 362E was superior to an equivalent dose of GLS-359E (P<0.001). For this reason, GLS-362E was profiled further.
Subsequent experiments extended the length of therapy for GLS-362E to 7 or 14 days because in the experiment shown in Table 2 it was observed that survival was not maintained beyond five days after the end of treatment in any group; studies were then designed to evaluate recurrence rates. Table 2 displays (below, from Dvoskin, et. al, 2012, AAC) twice-daily treatment for three days with either GLS-362E (50 mg/kg) or vancomycin (50 mg/kg), 67% of treated animals died. When treatment with GLS-362E is extended to 7 or 14 days, survival increased to 60 and 100%, respectively. Upon necropsy, the intestinal contents of surviving hamsters were negative for toxin A and/or B whereas those for animals that had died were positive. The results for the 3-day dosing shown in Table 2 above were from additional studies. Other studies conducted by Dvoskin et al. evaluated GLS-362E efficacy/recurrence rates in the hamster model at lower doses: after 14 days of dosing (100% survival for all groups at 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg out to 36 days; negative for A/B toxins): after 10 days of dosing at 10 mg/kg, GLS-362E treatment resulted in 86% survival on Day 36 post-infection, compared to vancomycin treatment’s 43% survival at the same dose (see graph and table below) and animals that died with C. difficile disease symptoms tested positive for A/B toxin, whereas the surviving animals did not.

C. difficile Infection Overview
Clostridioides difficile infection (“CDI”) is a bacterial infection of the colon that produces toxins causing inflammation of the colon and severe diarrhea. CDI can also result in more serious disease complications, including pseudomembranous colitis, bowel perforation, toxic megacolon and sepsis. CDI represents a serious healthcare issue in hospitals, long-term care homes and, increasingly, in the wider community. We estimate that there are over one million cases of CDI each year in the U.S. and Europe, based on an epidemiology report on CDI that was published in 2015 by Decision Resources, a healthcare research and consulting company. In addition, CDI is responsible for approximately 29,000 deaths per year in the U.S., according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. A separate study published in 2018 in Clinical Microbiology and Infection, a peer reviewed journal published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, indicated that CDI may be underdiagnosed in approximately 25% of cases. A study published in The Journal of Hospital Infection, a peer reviewed journal published by the Healthcare Infection Society, reported that CDI is two to four times more common than hospital associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium frequently associated with such infections. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, a family of databases developed through a federal-state-industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, reported an approximate three and one-half-fold increase in hospital stays associated with CDI between 2000 and 2008. The economic impact of CDI is significant. A study published in 2012 in Clinical Infectious Diseases estimated that acute care costs for CDI total $4.8 billion per year in the U.S. alone. According to the 2017 Update (published February 2018) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for C. difficile Infection by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society or Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), CDI remains a significant medical 

13



problem in hospitals, in long-term care facilities and in the community. C. difficile is one of the most common causes of health care-associated infections in U.S. hospitals (Lessa, et al, 2015, New England Journal of Medicine). Recent estimates suggest C. difficile approaches 500,000 infections annually in the U.S. and is associated with approximately 20,000 deaths annually. (Guh, 2020, New England Journal of Medicine). Based on internal estimates, the recurrence rate of two of the three antibiotics currently used to treat CDI is between 20% and 40% among approximately 150,000 patients treated. We believe the annual incidence of CDI in the U.S. approaches 600,000 infections and a mortality rate of approximately 9.3%. There are an additional six million patients in the U.S. per year with other Gram+ infections, such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus or Enterococcal, with approximately 300,000 patients treated for such infections.
CDI originates from a bacterium known as Clostridium difficile, or Clostridioides difficile, or C. difficile.
C. difficile can be a harmless resident of the gastrointestinal tract. The complex community of microorganisms that make up the natural gut flora usually moderates levels and pathogenicity of C. difficile. The natural gut flora is an essential part of the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract and also has wide implications to human health, such as the proper function of the immune system. CDI typically develops following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents that can cause widespread damage to the natural gut flora and allow overgrowth of C. difficile. Hypervirulent C. difficile strains have also emerged and are frequently associated with more severe disease. In the U.S., the hypervirulent strain, ribotype 027, accounts for approximately one-third of all CDI cases.
An important clinical issue with CDI is disease recurrence. This is in contrast to other bacterial threats for which drug resistance is the principal concern. According to an article published in 2012 in the peer reviewed journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 20% to 40% of patients with CDI suffer a second episode of the infection. The risk of further recurrence rises to 65% after a patient suffers a third episode of CDI. In addition, each episode of recurrent disease is associated with greater disease severity and higher mortality rates. Recurrent disease is associated with an increased burden on the healthcare system.
In 2013, and again in a 2019 Update, the CDC highlighted C. difficile as one of five pathogens that pose an immediate public health threat and require urgent and aggressive action. In 2012, the GAIN Act provisions became law along with the rest of FDASIA. The goal of the GAIN Act is to encourage the development of new antibiotics that treat specific pathogens, including C. difficile, which cause serious and life-threatening infections. Since the GAIN Act was adopted, there have been two antibiotic candidates developed for CDI that have been granted QIDP status under the GAIN Act, one of which was approved by the FDA in 2011. See “Current CDI Antibiotic Treatments” below.
Current CDI Antibiotic Treatments
Current treatment options for CDI are limited. The current standard-of-care for CDI is treatment with vancomycin or off label use of metronidazole, both of which are broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although these antibiotics reduce levels of C. difficile, both also cause significant collateral damage to the gut flora as a result of their broad spectrum of activity. This collateral damage to the gut flora leaves patients vulnerable to recurrent CDI. A review published in 2012 in the peer reviewed journal International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents reported recurrence rates of 24.0% for vancomycin and 27.1% for metronidazole. Metronidazole is frequently used in mild or moderate cases of CDI and has been associated with a number of side effects. The 2017 Update (published February 2018) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for C. difficile Infection by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provides a recommendation for clinicians to prescribe either vancomycin or fidaxomicin over metronidazole for an initial episode of CDI and metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of patients with CDI.
Fidaxomicin (Dificid®) is an antibiotic approved to treat patients with CDI in the U.S. and the European Union, but it has not been shown to be superior to vancomycin in the treatment of patients with the hypervirulent strain ribotype 027. Fidaxomicin (Dificid®) was approved by FDA in 2011. In July 2013, Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the sponsor of the fidaxomicin program, was sold to Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $535 million plus up to $266 million in contingent value right (“CVR”) payments post-closing. Fidaxomicin was the first antibacterial drug the FDA approved in more than 30 years to treat CDI. Cubist Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Merck in 2015 for approximately $8.4 billion. Merck 

14



continues to market fidaxomicin (Dificid®) and is expected to continue through the patent life which is expected to expire in mid-2027.
Summit Therapeutics had a clinical stage antibiotic, ridinilazole, and in January 2019 had opened enrollment of two Phase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with CDI. In December 2021, Summit Therapeutics announced that ridinilazole had failed to achieve the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 clinical trials and has since announced a plan to partner ridinalazole and has moved strategically into oncology drug development. The ridinilazole Phase 3 program included two randomized trials testing efficacy in CDI versus oral vancomycin, the standard of care, as the positive control. The trials appeared to be identical in design and planned to enroll 680 patients each. Prior to failing to achieve the primary endpoint in its Phase 3 clinical trials, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Summit Therapeutics announced that the FDA had rejected Summit’s request to change the endpoint in the then ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. Ridinilazole is an orally administered small molecule antibiotic designed to selectively target C. difficile bacteria without causing collateral damage to the gut flora and thereby reduce CDI recurrence rates. Prior to failing in its Phase 3 clinical trial, ridinilazole completed two Phase 2 clinical trials successfully meeting or exceeding its primary efficacy endpoints.
Despite the approval of fidaxomicin to treat CDI, the CDC continues to cite C. difficile bacteria as an urgent need for new antibiotics to treat CDI.
Clinical Strategy
Based on advice from our medical and scientific consultants and advisors, we believe we will need to conduct one Phase 2 clinical trial prior to conducting one or two large Phase 3 clinical trials in order to file a new drug application with the FDA for the oral use of ibezapolstat to treat patients with CDI. The trial design and anticipated size of the required clinical trials is as follows:

Phase 1 Clinical Trial: Data reported in August 2019.
The Phase 1 clinical trial design was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose trial to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and fecal microbiological effects of ibezapolstat administered orally to 62 healthy adults 18 years of age or older. For the single-dose ascending portion of the trial, the objectives were to evaluate the safety and determine the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure of single doses as well as the effects of food on PK. The multiple ascending dose portion of the trial evaluated the safety, PK and fecal concentrations of repeated doses as well as evaluate the effects of ibezapolstat on characteristics of the gut microbiome in comparison to the current standard of care treatment antibiotic, oral vancomycin. We successfully completed the Phase 1 clinical trial in August 2019 and the data supported advancing to Phase 2 according to our medical and scientific advisors. Blood levels 

15



of ibezapolstat show low systemic exposure, as predicted by previously conducted animal studies and are desirable in treating CDI, and fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude above the level required to kill CDI bacteria at the site of the infection.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial.
The Phase 2 clinical trial design is structured as a randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial of the efficacy and safety of ibezapolstat compared to vancomycin in the treatment of CDI in a total of up to 84 evaluable patients (Phase 2a; up to 20 patients; Phase 2b; 64 patients). Phase 2a was designed to enroll up to 20 patients with a data review planned by a Trial Oversight Committee after 10 patients completed the trial.
Based upon the recommendation of the SAB, in August 2020, we terminated enrollment in Phase 2a early and advanced to Phase 2b in December 2021. The SAB unanimously supported the early termination of the Phase 2a trial after 10 patients were enrolled in the trial instead of 20 patients as originally planned. The early termination was further based on the evidence of meeting the treatment goals of eliminating the infection with an acceptable adverse event profile.
The SAB noted that 10 out of 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial reached the Clinical Cure endpoint, defined in the study protocol as the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before the end-of-treatment that is maintained for 48 hours after end of treatment. Such cure was sustained, meaning that the patients showed no sign of infection recurrence, for 30 days thereafter. This constitutes a 100% response rate for the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial. All 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial met the study’s primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, namely, Clinical Cure at end of treatment and Sustained Clinical Cure of no recurrence of CDI at the 28-day follow-up visit. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported by the investigators who enrolled patients in the trial. We believe these results represent the first-ever clinical data showing Pol IIIC has potential as a therapeutically-relevant antibacterial target. The Phase 2b portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial is designed as a 64-patient vancomycin- controlled, non-inferiority designed efficacy study. 32 of the patients will receive 450mg of ibezapolstat twice per day, and 32 of the patients will receive 125mg of vancomycin four times per day. Both groups of patients will receive this treatment for 10 days. Phase 2b began enrollment on December 3, 2021. In the event non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin is demonstrated, further analysis will be conducted to test for superiority.
The SAB is comprised of seven scientists and clinicians who have significant expertise in the scientific disciplines required for the research and development of antibiotics. The members of the SAB serve at the pleasure of management, are paid in cash on an hourly basis for their services and do not receive equity compensation. Generally, the SAB is consulted by management during the process of designing our preclinical and clinical trials as well as in the process of analyzing data generated from these trials, although the SAB’s services are not limited to such activities.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial(s).
We intend to meet with the FDA after completing the Phase 2b clinical trial to finalize the size and scope of the Phase 3 clinical trial program. Regulatory precedent indicates that two Phase 3 trials of approximately 400 patients each would need to be conducted.
Regulatory Status
The regulatory timeline for a newly proposed product can take eight to ten years from pre-clinical studies through marketing approval. However, we inherited the manufacturing and pre-clinical data generated by the prior sponsor of our lead product candidate which we believe will reduce the timeline for regulatory approval by two to three years.
We have worked closely with the FDA to obtain our IND, and to obtain FDA fast track designation as well as designation of ibezapolstat as a QIDP, which provides incentives through the GAIN Act including FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP, fast-track designation eligibility and extension of statutory exclusivity periods in the U.S. for an additional five years upon FDA approval of the product for the treatment of CDI.

Government Regulation
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government regulation of drug products
In the U.S., the FDA regulates human drugs under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, or the agency’s issuance of warning letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), regulations or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice regulations and standards (“GCP”), and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.

17



Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies, to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety and toxicology studies.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and each study subject must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must thereafter conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1:   The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
Phase 2:   This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
Phase 3:   Clinical trials are undertaken with an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events (“SAEs”) occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, GCP, or other IRB requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the fee for the submission of an NDA for which clinical data is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2021 this application fee exceeds $2.8 million), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $300,000 per program. These fees are typically adjusted annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances.

18



Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), for original NDAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. For an all new molecular entity (“NME”), NDAs, the ten and six-month time periods run from the filing date; for all other original applications, the ten and six-month time periods run from the submission date. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an NDA to extend beyond the goal date.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form and outlines the deficiencies in the submission that must be addressed for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Once a drug is granted approval, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing
Overall, management believes the manufacturing process established by the prior sponsor of our ibezapolstat development program is efficient with cost of goods sold expected to be less than 5% of a preliminary range of proposed sales price estimates.
Thus far, ibezapolstat drug substance (DS) has been manufactured successfully in both 1 kg and 9 kg batches, with 9 kg batches considered to be a commercial scale. We anticipate that the commercial batch size upon completion of the clinical development program and submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) will be 10 kg to 15 kg which in our estimation will further reduce our cost of goods sold. The 9 kg batch was sufficient to support the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial needs (Phase 2a and Phase 2b). No material issues were noted in the manufacture of either the 1 kg or 9 kg batches of ibezapolstat to date with 36-month stability very good and well within acceptable FDA standards. Additionally, we can extrapolate to 48-months stability per FDA Manufacturing Guidance in advance of a 48-month pull point to occur in the first half of 2023.
Ibezapolstat drug product (DP), 150mg capsules, have been manufactured and used in the Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trial and are being used in the Phase 2b clinical trial. Thirty-six months stability data on capsules show no significant changes in the key quality attributes and no discernable data trends at any of the storage conditions. A minimum of 24-months shelf-life is anticipated. Through our outside manufacturing vendors, we will continue to monitor the stability of DS and DP on an ongoing basis as we continue to advance the clinical development program.
Market Opportunity
According to the 2017 Update (published February 2018) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Clostridium difficile Infection in Adults and Children by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), CDI remains a significant medical problem in hospitals, in long-term care facilities and in the community. Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is one of the most common causes of health care-associated infections in U.S. hospitals (Lessa, et al, 2015, New England Journal of Medicine). Recent estimates suggest C. difficile approaches 500,000 infections annually in the U.S. and is associated with approximately 20,000 deaths. (Guh, 2020, New England Journal of Medicine). Based on internal estimates including a recurrence rate of between 20% and 40% among approximately 150,000 patients treated, we believe that the annual incidence in the U.S. approaches 600,000 infections and a mortality rate of approximately 9.3%.
Antibiotics are the gold standard to treat CDI. However, while currently marketed antibiotics achieve a relatively high initial cure rate, they can fail to eliminate C. difficile, especially drug-resistant strains, in the gut, allowing the continued growth of the bacteria. This, together with a pronounced detrimental effect on the gut microbiome, leads to recurrence in over 25% of CDI patients after therapy is stopped. A significant unmet need remains for antibiotics that can meaningfully reduce recurrence. According to our recent clinical data, we believe ibezapolstat has the potential to continue to provide a bactericidal effect combined with a low incidence of recurrence when used to treat CDI.
Antibiotics provide advantages over the use of antibodies, microbiologics, and vaccines. Antibodies are generally only administered in combination with an antibiotic. Due to high costs and the inability to use antibodies as a first-line treatment, antibodies have gained limited commercial traction and there has only been one antibody treatment for CDI approved to date. As of the date of this Form 10-K, there are currently two microbiologics in late-stage development with clinical data forthcoming. Safety is a concern with microbiologics, and this course of treatment is only recommended for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments. There are also several vaccines against C. difficile in late-stage development, but none are currently approved. A vaccine is only likely to be commercially viable as a prevention of recurrent CDI in high-risk patients, if such patients can be identified. Additionally, large numbers of patients are required for clinical trials of vaccines, which could significantly delay the clinical development process for and eventual release of any CDI vaccine products currently in development.
C. difficile has surpassed MRSA, as the leading cause of death among hospitalized patients. CDI is a serious illness resulting from infection of the inner lining of the colon by C. difficile bacteria that produce toxins causing inflammation of the colon, severe diarrhea and, in the most serious cases, death. Patients typically develop CDI from the use of broad-

20



spectrum antibiotics that disrupt normal gastrointestinal (gut) flora, thus allowing C. difficile bacteria to flourish and produce toxins. C. difficile is a spore forming bacterium, creating spores excreted in the environment of the patients that can survive for months on dry surfaces in hospital rooms such as beds and doors, and can contaminate other patients by fecal-oral transmission through the hands of healthcare workers.
We estimate that, if approved with clinical data consistent with current data generated to date, ibezapolstat could capture over 40% of the CDI market in peak year sales based on the incidence rates noted above. At a preliminary price estimate of $3,000 to $3,500 per full course of treatment, this projects out to estimated peak year sales of over $1 billion per year in the U.S. alone. The peak market penetration of 40% assumes that there will be at least two treatment options available to treat CDI in addition to ibezapolstat even though only two antibiotics are currently recommended for the treatment of CDI and oral vancomycin has vulnerabilities with its 20%-40% reinfection rate and poor impact on patients’ microbiome. The selling price estimate of $3,000 to $3,500 is considered by management to be conservative as it is well below the price point of fidaxomicin, the most- recent approval in treating CDI which we believe is between $4,500 and $5,000 for a full course of treatment.
Management believes that this market opportunity is substantial and provides significant upside potential for those investing at this early stage of development. We believe the size of the market and relatively few treatment options available will drive our market capitalization and availability of financing alternatives as it completes Phase 2 clinical trials successfully.
In addition, we believe ibezapolstat’s profile provides an opportunity to develop significant market penetration of patients with recurrent infection following use of one of the initial-episode treatment options because of its unique mechanism of action.

Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific advisors and consultants as well as management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for 

21



clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Other small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete in the marketplace may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidate and other potential product candidates in the future are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
The competition for ibezapolstat include the following:

● | Several pharmaceutical companies have established themselves in the market for the treatment of CDI and several other companies are developing investigational antibiotics for the treatment of CDI. We expect these products, if approved, will compete with ibezapolstat;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Current antibiotic treatments used for patients with CDI include broad spectrum antibiotics like vancomycin and metronidazole, both of which are available in generic form in the U.S. Generic antibiotics typically are sold at lower prices than branded and currently marketed antibiotics and generally are preferred by managed care providers of health services although we believe we price competitively compared to any currently marketed branded or generic antibiotic to treat patients with CDI based on low cost of goods to manufacture ibezapolstat. Further pricing strategy will follow completion of our clinical development program; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fidaxomicin (Dificid® in the U.S., Dificlir™ in Europe) is approved for the treatment of CDI in the U.S. and Europe. Fidaxomicin was originally developed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was later acquired by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Cubist”). Cubist was then acquired by Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) in 2015;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A number of other approaches for the treatment of CDI are in development or have been approved as follows:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Merck developed a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, and obtained FDA approval for it in 2016 and EMA approval in 2016. This antibody neutralizes certain toxins that are produced by C. Difficile bacteria and would be an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fecal biotherapy aims to recolonize the bacteria that comprise the natural gut flora and, according to the 2017 IDSA Guidelines would be used for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed to resolve their infection despite treatment attempts with antibiotic agents targeting CDI. Finch Therapeutics recently failed with CP101, its lead therapeutic targeting patients with multiple recurrences of CDI using donor derived stool samples in an oral formulation, to our understanding, and in January 2023 discontinued its Ph3 clinical trial in this area.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fecal biotherapy approaches in development include SER-109, being developed by Seres Therapeutics, Inc., which is an investigational oral microbiome therapeutic for the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection in adults with multiply recurrent CDI. The FDA has granted SER-109 both Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations and has recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rebiota™(fecal microbiota, live-jslm) was recently approved by FDA as a fecal microbiota product which is prepared from stool donated by qualified individuals and delivered via enema for the prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in adults.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22




● | CRS3123 (Crestone Inc) is a novel small molecule that selectively inhibits methionyl-tRNA synthetase of C. difficile and is reported on clinicaltrials.gov as recruiting in a Phase 2 clinical trial with a primary completion date that was targeted for December 2021 but is listed as currently ongoing on the Crestone website.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MGB-BP-3 (MGB Biopharma) is a novel synthetic polyamide active against Gram- positive pathogens and binds to the minor groove of DNA. MGB announced that it has completed a dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical trial in 2020 but there are no indications publicly that MGB BioPharma has commenced Ph3.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No new antibiotics in clinical development have shown improvement in either initial clinical cure (“ICR”) or sustained clinical response (“SCR”) in comparison to currently marketed antibiotics. The data in the chart below constitute comparisons of data from prior clinical trials published in scientific journals for each listed antibiotic or antibiotic candidate and does not incorporate data, if any, from any control arm(s) that may be or may have been required to seek and obtain FDA approval. The data listed for ibezapolstat are from the Phase 2a clinical trial where no comparator agent was used. The only comparative data for ibezapolstat in clinical trials currently relate only to comparisons of the impact on the microbiome for ibezapolstat and vancomycin but do not compare clinical cure rates. All data presented is based on identical clinical endpoints used for ICR and SCR.

​
Competitive Strengths
We attribute our success to the following competitive strengths:

(i) | We have a novel mechanism of action which we believe will be highly advantageous given the continuing rate of recurrent CDI with currently available treatment options and the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23




(ii) | Since ibezapolstat’s molecular structure and mechanism of action are unrelated to any other antimicrobial chemical class, its use is not expected to foster the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to other classes of antibiotics;
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | The Phase 1 Trial showed highly selective activity against C. difficile bacteria with minimal disruption to the gut flora as it is poorly soluble which has been corroborated by the data from the microbiome analysis;
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | The Phase 2a clinical trial data demonstrated a 100% cure rate at end of treatment and 100% sustained clinical response, in each case, in the ten patients who were enrolled and was terminated early based on the recommendation of our SAB based on the efficacy data and safety and tolerability profile;
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | Microbiome data from Phase 2a trial patients demonstrated complete eradication of colonic C. difficile by day three of treatment with ibezapolstat as well as the observed overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota, Actinobacteria and Firmicute phyla species, both during and after treatment. Significantly, emerging data show an increased concentration of secondary bile acids which is known to correlate with a low risk of reinfection. Moreover, a decrease in primary bile acids and the favorable increase in the ratio of secondary-to-primary bile acids provides more scientific evidence suggesting recurrences may be very low in future trials.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(vi) | To date, ibezapolstat has shown an excellent human safety profile;
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------


(vii) | Our designation by the FDA of Qualified Infectious Disease (QIDP) status and Fast Track designation provides significant benefits to our development of ibezapolstat. We have significant existing patent coverage in the world’s largest pharmaceutical markets (U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada) extending to September 2030 in the United States and September 2030 in foreign markets. There is also the possibility to extend those patents thereafter;
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(viii) | We have a simple and low-cost process of manufacturing which is expected to yield cost of goods of less than 5% of the anticipated retail price; and
-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ix) | We believe that there is a high probability that the Phase 2b trial will be successful. If the vancomycin cure rate in our Phase 2b trial is 26/32 (81%); then ibezapolstat needs to achieve a cure rate of 24/32 (75%) in the Phase 2b clinical trial to be considered non-inferior (“NI”), to vancomycin based on a “p-value” of .0344. A “p value” is a statistical probability value used by FDA and drug developers to evaluate the efficacy, in this case, of development stage antibiotic candidates and their comparability to one or more approved products. A “p value” of .0344 is within FDA standards used by drug development companies to compare an experimental product candidate, like ibezapolstat, against an existing standard-of-care.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity
We have two U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Numbers 6,926,763 and 8,796,292), with claims that cover ibezapolstat that expire in May 2023 and September 2030, respectively. The most important U.S. patent in management’s view, is the composition-of-matter patent (8,796,292) which expires in September 2030. Patent Number 6,926,763 includes claims that cover disubstituted purine compounds, compositions, surface coatings, and methods of treating bacterial infection or inhibiting bacterial growth, and these claims cover ibezapolstat. Patent Number 8,796,292 includes other claims that cover other disubstituted purine compounds, compositions, and methods of inhibiting bacterial growth and these claims cover ibezapolstat. Either patent may be subject to extension subject to certain circumstances.
For ibezapolstat, we also have one composition-of-matter patent in each of Europe, Japan and Canada. All of these non-U.S. patents expire in September 2030, subject to extension under certain circumstances.
In addition, we have filed three provisional patent applications in 2021 covering methods of treating C. difficile infection and preventing recurrence as well as simultaneous promotion of microbiome health. We filed a non-

24



provisional patent application and an international patent application in 2022 covering methods of treating C. difficile infection and preventing recurrence while simultaneously promoting microbiome health. We also filed a new provisional patent application in 2022 covering compositions and methods to promote gut microbiome health. 
We believe the commercial opportunity for ibezapolstat is best protected by regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. that has been made available for new chemical entities (five years) and QIDP designated products (five years).
The FDA has granted QIDP status for the oral use of ibezapolstat to treat CDI. QIDP status is provided by the FDA under the GAIN Act and provides incentives for us as the sponsor of the ibezapolstat development program, including FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP, eligibility for “fast track” status and extension of statutory exclusivity periods in the U.S. for an additional five years upon FDA approval of ibezapolstat for the treatment of CDI. In January 2019, the FDA approved “fast track” designation for ibezapolstat for the oral treatment of CDI. Accordingly, we will have 10 years of regulatory exclusivity on the oral use of ibezapolstat to treat CDI from the date of FDA marketing approval.
We believe the patent and regulatory coverage already in place provides strong protection for the commercialization of ibezapolstat and we will continue to consider additional patent submissions as we review available pre-clinical and clinical data as it becomes available throughout the development program.
We have obtained three U.S. patents and one Israeli patent on ACX-375C, our second antibiotic program, and has a fourth U.S. patent application and multiple foreign applications pending for ACX-375C. Our three U.S. patents and Israeli patent on ACX-375C include composition-of-matter, surface coating, and method of use claims. Absent any patent extensions, these patents will expire in December 2039. We anticipate that the patent protection will be further supported by regulatory exclusivity available to new classes of antibiotics treating life-threatening infections (QIDP Designation by FDA – 5 years) and New Chemical Entity Designation (5 years). We anticipate filing for and receiving QIDP Designation as well as “Fast Track” with FDA in the next 24 months for ACX-375C, both of which designations have been granted by FDA for ibezapolstat, our lead antibiotic program.
GAIN Exclusivity for Antibiotics
Our regulatory strategy includes targeting QIDP designation by the FDA under the GAIN Act. Congress passed the GAIN Act as part of FDASIA in 2012 to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections.
Potential External Positive Drivers for Sector
Future external funding opportunities change over time but include the following:
PASTEUR Act. The PASTEUR Act is legislation currently in the U.S. congress which, if approved, would provide “pull” incentives in the U.S. for developers of new classes of antibiotics that target a critical need. According to the Pasteur Act, the US Department of Health and Human Services would pay a subscription payment for eligible products of $750 million to $3 billion over a ten-year period and patients would receive the drug at no cost. In addition, HHS would provide transitional support to fund Phase 3 clinical trials and manufacturing requirements for certain innovative antimicrobial drugs.
AMR Action Fund. The AMR Action Fund was created by the Antimicrobial Resistance Congress to generate interest to develop new classes of antibiotics to treat priority pathogens on the WHO and CDC priority pathogens list. The AMR Action Fund is funded by over 20 fully integrated worldwide pharmaceutical companies which have pledged over $1 billion to fund clinical activities of up to 15 sponsors of new classes of antibiotics to treat priority pathogens.
DISARM Act. The DISARM Act is legislation currently in the U.S. Congress which would remove the financial disincentives now in place for prescribers of antibiotics to use novel agents possibly more efficacious than older, less effective antibiotics that are prescribed at a lower cost. Accordingly, treating physicians would have the opportunity to 

25



treat patients with infectious disease with the most effective agents thereby enhancing patient outcomes as well as reducing the cost burden on public health.
EU Pull Incentives. Given the adoption of pull incentives for certain critical antibiotics adopted in the U.K. and under consideration in the U.S., the European Union currently is considering adopting certain pull incentives specifically to incentivize sponsors of key antibiotic development programs in the European Union. The European Union also is considering the creation and funding of a new regulatory organization similar to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”), which is a division of the HHS which, among other things, is responsible to protect the U.S. against pandemic threats.
Pipeline Products
A series of novel antibacterial molecules derived from ACX-375C appear to share the same mechanism of action with ibezapolstat, i.e. they inhibit the Pol IIIC enzyme in certain Gram-positive bacterial cells including both sensitive and resistant Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), MRSA, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, PRSP and other resistant bacteria. Further characterization and testing of these molecules is ongoing.

This diverse series of new agents which are believed to bind Pol IIIC and thereby prevent it from synthesizing new DNA, as shown below, where the gray area is the Pol IIIC enzyme and the therapeutic molecule occupies the critical binding pocket.
Compounds in this series have demonstrated potent activity against clinically important pathogens including minimum inhibitory concentration values (“MIC values”) against MRSA, VRE and PRSP of 1 – 4 µg/mL. Further characterization and testing in animal models are ongoing.
Acurx has pioneered the clinical development of a pol IIIC inhibitor as a clinically valid bacterial target. Ibezapolstat cured 10 of 10 (100%) patients after 10-days treatment with no recurrences during the 30-day follow up period in a Phase 2a trial for C. difficile infection (CDI). Gut microbiome analyses further showed that potentially beneficial bacterial species are selectively preserved in CDI patients during treatment with ibezapolstat; the pol IIIC Mechanism-of-Action (MOA) suggests that this is a class effect.
Acurx is also developing a systemic pol IIIC Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSS) oral and IV antibiotic. The initial hit ACX 375C is pan-active against wild-type and drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., MRSA, VRE 

26



and PRSP). Acurx has synthesized and tested >600 novel analogs targeting pol IIIC. To date, 20 novel compounds with MIC values ≤1 μg/mL for both MRSA and VRE have been identified (see Table below).

MIC Range | | MRSA | | VRE | | MRSA and VRE | 
----------------+---+--------------+---+---------------+---+--------------+--
< 1 µg/mL | ​ | 20 compounds | ​ | 65 compounds | ​ | 20 compounds | ​
>1 to <2 µg/mL | ​ | 74 compounds | ​ | 111 compounds | ​ | 74 compounds | ​
>2 to < 4 µg/mL | ​ | 82 compounds | ​ | 92 compounds | ​ | 82 compounds | ​

​
The Hit-to-Lead program produced improvements in solubility, cytotoxicity, and protein binding with a comprehensive SAR understanding. Pol IIIC inhibitors have a novel MOA and activity of ACX-375 against MRSA and VRE bacteria was not impacted by vancomycin-, daptomycin-, or linezolid-resistance. Pol IIIC is absent in Gram-negative bacteria and mammalian cells.
New analogs show improved characteristics directly related to clinical therapeutic utility: improved solubility for IV formulation, improved safety vs. HepG2, as an initial predictor of pharmacologic safety, and decreased plasma protein binding, to further improve in vivo efficacy.
These analogs have maintained potent MICs against MRSA, MSSA, PRSP, E. faecalis and VRE. 
In vivo pharmacology studies have been encouraging but are not yet determinative. PK studies in mice demonstrate oral and IV exposures sufficient for efficacy testing in infection models. Oral bioavailability of 31-59% was demonstrated by 10 different analogs when administered as a simple liquid formulation. Oral bioavailability will improve further through formulation optimization.
The solubility of pol IIIC inhibitors has been improved by prodrug efforts, which support the viability of an IV formulation. Phosphate prodrugs for two compounds showed rapid conversion from inactive prodrug to active parent drug with good exposures following IV and PO dosing in mice. Solubility was improved to the range of 1 mg/mL, which is viable for IV formulation.
Efficacy has been demonstrated in 4 different mouse models involving different body sites including the critically important lung and thigh. The models were: MRSA peritonitis (3 analogs >60% protection, median survival >7 days); MRSA thigh (neutropenic; 1 analog 1.28 log10 CFU reduction); VRE thigh (neutropenic; 4 analogs 1.21-1.94 log10 CFU reduction); and PRSP lung (neutropenic; 5 analogs 1.03-1.69 log10 CFU reduction). Oral efficacy was demonstrated in 3 models. Lead optimization will seek to further improve efficacy, especially in the thigh model which is a simulation of the initial clinical indication.
One analog tested in a battery of safety screens (Eurofins 44 panel, CiPA panel, and CYP inhibition assays) showed no liabilities. As a pilot study, two analogs were tested in 5-day repeat dose studies in mice at 50 mg/kg TID (150 mg/day). One analog showed no HepG2 cytotoxicity (IC50 >128 µg/mL) in vitro, while the 2nd showed effects (IC50 30 µg/mL). There were no adverse effects observed in life, no changes in body weight, and no significant gross necropsy findings for either compound. Serum chemistry showed no effects (treated vs. control; n=5/group) for the 1st compound (IC50 >128 µg/mL) while the 2nd (IC50 30 µg/mL) showed elevated liver enzymes for one analog in several mice dosed IV and PO. These results were encouraging since the HepG2 in vitro assay is used as a marker for potential in vivo toxicity. 
Spontaneous resistance frequency is low (<3.17x10-9 and <1.30x10-9 for MRSA and VRE, respectively, at 4xMIC), and there is no cross-resistance with other antibiotics. Acurx is studying potential MOR (Mechanism of Resistance) to pol IIIC inhibitors using whole genome sequencing. 
In collaboration with two laboratories at Leiden University Medical Center under a Dutch government grant, the 3-D structure of pol IIIC from MRSA, VRE and PRSP alone and bound to Acurx inhibitors will be studied using cryo-EM/X-ray crystallography. Using this, novel analogs with improved binding will be tested.

The Acurx Lead Optimization program is modifying existing leads to develop compounds with improved potency, less plasma protein binding, and increased exposures. The Lead Optimization Program includes developing an improved rapid assay of pol IIIC inhibitor activity (Ki) for MRSA, VRE, and PRSP; determining the 3 D structure of Acurx compounds bound to pol IIIC enzymes for improved SAR; developing/testing novel oral formulations to improve bioavailability; and testing prodrug compounds in animal infection/safety models. Oral and IV candidates from Lead Optimization will then advance to preclinical testing and Phase 1 SAD (Single Ascending Dose) / MAD (Multiple Ascending Dose) trials.
The initial clinical indication is targeting gram-positive acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI); subsequent trials may target confirmed Gram-positive infections for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), bloodstream infections/endocarditis, diabetic foot infections, and/or osteomyelitis. ABSSSI is an ideal clinical indication for a pan active gram-positive drug since the clinical end points, comparators, and execution are well established.
These bacterial targets (MRSA, VRE and PRSP) involve an incidence of approximately six million patients per year in the U.S. alone. Based on a review of other antibiotics currently marketed to treat these bacterial infections, our early estimate of peak year sales potential is 4% to 5% of this annual incidence and a peak year sales potential of approximately $1 billion.
