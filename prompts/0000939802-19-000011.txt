Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
Capstone Companies, Inc. is a public holding company organized under the laws of the State of Florida.  The Company is an innovator and engaged in the business of developing, marketing and selling consumer home LED lighting products through nationally and internationally recognized retailers in North America and in certain overseas markets. The primary operating subsidiary is Capstone Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation located in the principal executive offices of the Company ("CAPI"). Capstone International Hong Kong, Ltd., or "CIHK", was established to expand the Company's product development, engineering and factory resource capabilities in Hong Kong. The existing lighting portfolio consists of innovative and easy to use consumer LED lighting products. The Company's products are sold under CAPI brand name, Capstone Lighting®, as well as under a nationally recognized licensed brand-named, Hoover® Home LED.
 
The Company's focus in recent years has been in the integration of LEDs into most commonly used lighting products in today's home. The LED market, now in its fifth to sixth year of mainstream availability, has stabilized.  LEDs are now mainstream in consumer lighting products. The Company believes that the component and production costs of LED lighting products will continue to lower due to technological and production developments.
 
Over the last two years there has been significant LED price erosion, which has substantially driven unit sales, as homeowner’s convert to LED, but at the same time has commoditized other LED consumer products.  The LED category is maturing and is no longer the innovative “must have” consumer product as in previous years.
 
Capstone’s success has been in its ability to identify emerging product categories where Capstone’s management experience can be fully leveraged.  We demonstrated this when the Company entered the LED lighting category.  Our branding and product strategies delivered the Company to a well-respected market position delivering year-over-year growth through 2017.  The Company’s low-cost manufacturing and operations have provided an advantage in delivering great products affordably.
 
As management recognized that the growth of the LED category was maturing in 2017, we sought a business opportunity that would prove equal to or greater than the LED business.  While we currently continue to develop new LED products, the revenue potential has been lessened and our new looking forward strategy was timely.
 
Our expectation is that the new portfolio appeals to a much larger audience, with more relevant products that will hopefully benefit from management’s proven abilities in the areas of low-cost production and operations.  The new Connected Surfaces portfolio is designed to tap into consumer’s ever-expanding connected lifestyles prevalent today.  The products will have both touch screen and voice interfacing, internet access and an operating system capable of running downloadable applications.  The average selling prices will be comparable to that of tablets and smartphones, expected retails to start at $500.00 per unit, with the goal to deliver consumer value for middle income homes.  Whereas, during the day your smartphone/tablet keeps you connected, whether it is work or personal, now when entering your home, Capstone’s new Connected Surfaces products will enable users the same level of connectivity in a more relaxed manner that does not require being tethered to these devices.

The Company competes in competitive consumer market channels that can be affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors such as, consumer confidence, employment levels, credit availability and commodity costs. Demand for the Company’s products is highly dependent on economic drivers such as consumer spending and discretionary income. While we believe that the markets for LED home products will remain competitive during fiscal 2019, we are confident in maintaining our revenue stream in the lighting business segment by continuing to introduce new innovative LED products.  The first of these new LED products will be present in the retail market place during the first quarter of 2019.   By working diligently overseas with alternate manufacturers located outside China, particularly in Thailand and Vietnam, we anticipate minimal impact to our selling prices and related margins of profit that could otherwise be impacted by ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China.
 
We continue to make investments to ensure that we provide quality, useful products. Additionally, the Company continues to enhance its customer service support.  The year 2019 will also mark a vastly expanded commitment to social media marketing.  This will play a vital role in expanding our lifestyle brands and will also serve to establish creditability with the Company’s growing consumer base. This effort will focus on creating a more extensive and aggressive social media presence through use of third-party social media like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram as well as measures to increase our “ranking” in search engines.
 
The Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and increasing shareholder returns by providing innovative products on a global basis that make consumer's lives simpler and safer while delivering revenue growth to the Company's retail partners.
 
The Company oversees and controls the manufacturing of its products, which are currently made in China by OEM contract manufacturers, through three wholly-owned operating subsidiaries: CAPI, CIHK and CLTL. The Company's direct import business model requires that shipments meet minimum order quantity or "MOQ" full container loads from its factories directly to retail customers shipping brokers.   This business model avoids pitfalls resulting from slow moving and obsolete product inventories.  The Company's products are built to fill backlog orders and are typically not warehoused for domestic replenishment programming.  CIHK continually evaluates its contract manufacturers' ability to meet the Company's growing needs.  Additionally, all manufacturers must meet rigorous compliance, security and equipment evaluation audits to ensure competitive pricing for the highest quality products. Capstone’s business practices have allowed development of excellent relationships with its OEM contract manufacturers and has resulted in commercially favorable payment terms, which over the years has greatly contributed to the Company's growth.  The Company continues to explore alternative manufacturing sources in Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim as part of its ongoing supply chain strategic planning. The Company has made no commitments to non-Chinese OEM’s as of the date of the filing of this Report.
 
History of Our Business
 
We were incorporated on September 18, 1986 as a Delaware corporation. Our initial public offering under the Securities Act was conducted in 1987.  We started as a blank check company.  From 1986 until the 2006 acquisition of CAPI, we experienced several changes in management, corporate name, and primary business lines, as well as reincorporation from Delaware to Colorado and then from Colorado to Florida in 2004.
 
On September 13, 2006, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with CAPI.  CAPI was incorporated in Florida on May 15, 1996 and is engaged primarily in the business of wholesaling low technology consumer products to distributors and retailers in the United States.  Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of CAPI’s Common Stock, and recorded goodwill of $1,936,020.

On April 13, 2012, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong, named Capstone International Hong Kong Ltd ("CIHK"), which provides support services such as engineering, new product development, product sourcing, factory certification and compliance, product price negotiating, product testing and quality control and ocean freight logistics for the Company's other subsidiaries. CIHK is also engaged in selling the Company's products internationally.
 
The Company entered the LED consumer market eight years ago. At that time, it was clear to management that there was a significant opportunity for an innovative low-cost LED product supplier as the lighting industry was on its transition path from traditional lighting technologies to LED.
 
Capstone was an early innovator in the introduction of lower cost LED lighting products that have distinctive features creating strong consumer appeal.   The Company's product lines consisted of decorative lighting, outdoor fixtures, lighting with built-in power failure technology and safety and security.  The power failure lighting and security products were initially sold under its wholly-owned subsidiary Capstone Industries brand name through 2015.
 
Commencing in 2014, Capstone explored and researched branding opportunities that would allow the Company to differentiate from its own Capstone Lighting® brand.  The underlying strategy enabled Capstone to effectively provide product to competing retailers within the same channel.
 
In 2015 the Company secured and launched the North America trademark license for the Hoover® brand for LED lighting products.  The Hoover® name is a 100-year-old household iconic brand name. Hoover® is a registered trademark of Techtronic Floor Care Technology Limited. In 2017 the Company also launched one new product under the Duracell® brand for a special promotional event that expired in 2018.
 
In the latter part of 2014, the Company concluded that conventional retail was going to undergo significant change in its LED product and vendor selections.  Early LED light bulbs were deemed early technologies and were seen by the Company as too expensive. The early LED products did not look like light bulbs and were not marketed effectively in the opinion of the Company. As such, buying an LED light bulb was potentially confusing to the consumer.  Over the course of the next year, retail prices for early LED products eroded and negatively impacted the supply chain.  Capstone forecasted this outcome and focused its primary marketing approach towards the warehouse club channel where low retail mark-ups circumvented this market condition.  The Company was timely in this strategic market entry and benefited from the limited number of vendors competing in this arena at that time.  The Company concluded that larger LED bulb suppliers were concerned with protecting established retail price positions and they could not, as such, effectively market their brands in both conventional retail channels and warehouse club channels.
 
The Company's operations consist of one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Lighting Products.
 
Lighting Industry Trends
 
Demand for the Company’s LED lighting products sold at retail is highly dependent on economic drivers, such as consumer spending discretionary income, along with home improvement spending.
 
As a result of higher energy costs and environmental concerns (as shown by U.S. Energy Information Administration studies), consumers seek new technologies to improve product energy efficiency, provide increased lighting functionality and reduce overall energy costs. LED lighting is more efficient than fluorescent lighting and represents significant energy savings for consumers. Encouraged by support from public utility programs, LED lighting has now achieved widespread consumer use.

Technological Maturity:
 
Since the introduction of the first visible LED in the 1960s, the technology has offered an increasingly wide variety of colored lighting, beginning with red and expanding to green, yellow and orange. In the mid-1990's, LEDs became capable of emitting blue light. With the advent of the blue LEDs combined with phosphor technology, LEDs made another technological advancement by emitting white LEDs. This breakthrough enabled LEDs, through its full color spectrum output capabilities, to compete with preferred color temperatures achieved by traditional lighting solutions.
 
The technological advancement of LED lighting has surpassed traditional lighting performance in terms of brightness, efficiency, lamp life, safety, maintenance reduction and color-rendering. This maturity continues to drive growing market adoption as the technology incorporates other functionalities.
 
Cost Comparison:
 
Market forces, including competitive pressure, greater manufacturing efficiencies and increased technology adoption among consumers, continue to significantly drive down LED prices. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2018 report shows that LED lighting uses 25-80% less energy than traditional incandescent lighting, lasts up to 25 times longer and has significant savings in energy costs. LED use is projected to reduce United States lighting energy consumption by 40% in 2030, worth over $26 billion of savings at today’s energy prices.
Social Responsibility:
 
LED lighting solutions provide a significant opportunity for consumers to meet environmental goals and to significantly reduce energy consumption. LEDs do not contain mercury, unlike fluorescent lighting, which can be harmful to the environment, do not emit ultraviolet radiation, typically do not contain glass and are 100% recyclable.
Our Growth Strategy
 
The Company’s looking forward strategy requires continued expansion of its product development and engineering, manufacturing base marketing and distribution of a broadened portfolio of consumer electronic products. The Company will seek new revenue opportunities through the introduction of its “Connected Surfaces” portfolio into expanded channels of distribution including E-Commerce and others that the Company has not previously focused on. The Company also intends to leverage our existing valuable customer base and strong relationships to achieve organic growth initiatives with this new category.
Organic Growth Strategy
 
We intend to pursue various initiatives to execute our organic growth strategy which is designed to enhance our market presence, expand our customer base and be an industry leader in new product development.  Key elements of our organic growth strategy include:
 
Connected Surfaces. Historically LED lighting products have been our core business. The Capstone Lighting and Hoover® Home LED brands combined, have sold millions of LED lighting products over the recent years and consequently the Company holds a well-respected position in the retail lighting category. While consistently launching successful lighting programs, the Company has determined that it needs to diversify and expand its core focus in order to continue to meet revenue growth initiatives. The Company has refocused its development and marketing initiatives and is determined to build on its success with a broader product portfolio beyond lighting products only.  Critical to this strategy, the Company has developed and launched in January 2019 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), a new line of “Connected Surfaces” products. We intend to expand the new line of “Connected Products” for the next several years.  Our current product roadmap outlines plan for product introductions through 2020 and this will continue to expand as product acceptance validates how our objectives.  We believe this program will leverage existing relationships with our current retail partners and contribute organic growth for the Company.

The Company acknowledges that smart homes will become more mainstream over the next several years and will present growth opportunities for our company and its Connected Surfaces portfolio.
 
Perceived or Essential Strengths
 
Capstone believes that the following competitive strengths have and will continue to serve as a foundation for its business strategy.
 
In North America, the Company is recognized as an innovator and highly efficient, low-cost manufacturer in several lighting product niches.  Capstone believes that its personal relationships with retail customers combined with its innovative product offerings, strong marketing support and the high level of integrity embedded within the company, will allow the Company to successfully launch the new “Connected Surfaces” category and expand its portfolio in the Home Lighting category.
 
The Company believes its multiple brand strategy is important in maintaining differentiation in the marketplace and maybe considered in future Connected Surfaces products. Capstone Lighting®, Hoover® Home LED and Duracell® have proven successful in the past in meeting expectations at point of sale and licensing, and once again, within the Connected Surfaces program may be part of our looking forward strategy.
 
Capstone's core executive team has been working together for over three decades and has successfully built and managed other consumer product companies.  Operating Management's experience in hardline product manufacturing and marketing prepared the Company for its entry into the LED market. From a market perspective, Capstone's branding strategy was focused on establishing multiple trusted brands allowing for a broader reach into various channels.  Capstone Lighting® (2008), Hoover® Home LED (2015) and Duracell® (2017) have contributed to expanding the Company's retail position.
 
Product Quality: We offer quality products allowing consumers to maximize the benefits of adopting innovative lifestyle products. We design, manufacture and sell quality and reliable products across all of our brands with functional advantages that are cost competitive. We achieve this, in part, through a combination of sourcing quality components, stringent manufacturing quality control and conducting rigorous third-party product testing. To deliver cost-competitive products, we are investing in product advancements, leveraging purchasing volume, capitalizing on strategic vendor relationships and migrating high-volume products to our proprietary manufacturing process.
 
The Company's product characteristics are designed to satisfy the following:
 
 
· | To make everyday tasks or usage simpler and more enjoyable for consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | While continuing to focus on increased profit margins, the products must be affordable to win at the point of sale and deliver increased revenues for retail partners; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The products must represent significant value when compared with items produced or marketed by competitive consumer product companies; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wherever feasible, the products must be unique to the market whether this be accomplished though design techniques, added functionality or some proprietary innovation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Authoritative Knowledge: We invest in employees and manufacturers with extensive knowledge, understanding and experience of technology, and regulatory environments that enables us to continue to provide superior quality products and service for our customers.  Our management team has demonstrated its ability to drive organic growth.

With respect to the Company's goal of sustained profitability, the challenge has been and remains to achieve greater profit margins from our product lines by either innovative products that induce consumers to pay a higher purchase price or increased efficiencies in producing and selling products that sustain attractive pricing.  This challenge confronts many consumer product companies. Capstone believes that appropriate use of OEM capabilities in innovation and production coupled with design that appeals to consumers are critical factors in meeting this challenge, especially for a smaller or niche competitor.
 
Due to the extensive, modern manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities with the Company's OEM contract manufacturers, and the lower unit costs in China, Capstone believes that it is more economical and efficient to continue to manufacture certain products in China and have them shipped to the United States rather than to have such products produced in North America.  While this resource is available to and used by large numbers of U.S. companies, including our competitors, the Company believes this Chinese manufacturing resource gives the Company the level of innovation, production cost and quality that allows Capstone to be competitive with larger competitors in the United States.  However, as design technologies can influence the degree of hand labor in building its future products, the Company expects the advantages it has realized by manufacturing solely in China to be challenged.
 
The U.S federal government has recently imposed tariffs on certain Chinese imports. Currently the Company’s products are sourced in China and are impacted by the recently imposed tariffs. Future U.S. policy changes that maybe implemented, including further increased tariffs could have a negative consequence on the Company’s financial performance depending how the changes influence many factors, including business and consumer sentiment.
 
Management’s efforts to mitigate the impact of these added costs include a variety of activities, including the evaluation of alternative OEM manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan.
 
The Company expanded CIHK's operations in Hong Kong with personnel experienced in engineering and design, product development and testing, product sourcing, international logistics and quality control.  These associates work with our OEM factories to develop and prototype new product concepts and to ensure products meet consumer product regulations and rigorous quality control standards.  All products are tested before and during production by Company personnel.  This team also provides extensive product development, quality control and logistics support to our factory partners to ensure on time shipments.
 
Perceived Weaknesses
 
Capstone believes that its competitive weaknesses are:  (1) it does not possess the business, marketing and financial resources of its largest competitors; (2) the Company is actively building its new Social Media marketing programming and  its e-commerce development but does not yet have a prominent social media presence; (3) it sells a niche consumer product that is sensitive to a drop in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions affecting consumer confidence; (4) its current products lines are focused on consumer LED lighting;  (5) profitability may be limited by attainable profit margins from consumer lighting products as markets mature; (6) Capstone does not have the large internal research and development capability of its largest competitors; (7) Capstone operates with a limited number of employees who are dedicated to executive management, sales and marketing or administrative support; (8) we rely on OEM's for product production; (9) our international purchases can become more expensive if the U.S. Dollar weakens against the foreign currencies and (10) as we currently manufacture our products in China, the increased U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese manufactured goods may negatively impact demand and/or increase the cost for our products at retail, which could negatively impact our business.

--+----------------------------------------------



These product offerings encompass solutions for various residential lighting applications for interior and outdoor use.
 
Such product expansion involves the inherent risk of increased operating and marketing costs without a corresponding increase in operational revenues and profits.  Further, some product lines may fall out of favor with consumers before we can recoup product and market development costs.  While the Company makes significant investments into the 2019 Connected Surfaces portfolio, it is reasonable to expect to post losses while building the market for a new category of products which were launched at the 2019 CES.  Expense categories including; molds, prototyping, engineering, advertising, public relations, tradeshows and social media platforms will all be incurred for six to nine months before shipments and related revenues occur.
 
The Company has established product distribution relationships with numerous leading international, national and regional retailers, including but not limited to: Amazon, Bunnings, Costco Wholesale, Home Depot, Sam's Club-Walmart, the Container Store and Firefly Buys. These distribution channels may sell the Company's products through the internet as well as through retail storefronts and catalogs/mail order.  The Company believes it has developed the scale, manufacturing efficiencies, and design expertise that serves as the foundation for aggressive pursuit of niche product opportunities in our largest consumer domestic and international markets. While Capstone has traditionally generated the majority of its sales in the U.S. market, urbanization, rising family incomes and increased living standards abroad have spurred a perceived demand for small consumer appliances internationally. To capture this market opportunity, the Company has continued its international sales by leveraging relationships with our existing global retailers and by strengthening our international product offerings.  CIHK assists the Company in placing more products into foreign market channels as well.  The Company introduced Capstone brands to markets outside the U.S., including Australia, France, Iceland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom.  International sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.270 million or 10.0% of net revenue as compared to $1.812 million or 4.9% in fiscal 2017. The Company's performance depends on a number of assumptions and factors.  Critical to growth are the economic conditions in the markets that we serve, as well as success in the Company's initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features.

The Company's products are subject to general economic conditions that impact discretionary consumer spending on non-essential items. Capstone believes it will maintain its presence in the lighting category because of its proven abilities in operational excellence, the quality reputation of its products, business relationships with Capstone's retailers and the aggressive product development strategies currently in place.  Such continued progress depends on a number of assumptions and factors, including ones mentioned in "Risk Factors" below.  Critical to growth are economic conditions in the markets that foster greater consumer spending as well as success in the Company's initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features.  The Company's ability to fund the pursuit of our goals remains a constant, significant factor.
 
The Company believes that it will provide retailers with a broader and more diversified portfolio of consumer products across product categories, which should add diversity to the Company's revenues and cash flows sources.  Within the selection of products offered, Capstone seeks to service the needs of a wide range of consumers by providing products to satisfy their different interests, preferences and budgets.  The Company believes in its ability to serve retailers with an array of branded products and quickly introduce new products to continue to allow Capstone to further penetrate its existing customer bases, while also attracting new customers. The Company's primary, perceived challenge is creating sustained consumer demand for its products in a growing number of markets and attaining sustained profitability, which challenge is complicated by the cost of new product development and costs of penetrating new markets. An extensive product line, especially new product line, increases the investment in product development and, as such, increases operating overhead.
 
With the Company's lighting products and recently launched “Connected Surfaces” category, Capstone has developed a comprehensive product offering for its niche in the retail industry. Within the selection of products offered, Capstone seeks to service the needs of a wide range of consumers by providing products to satisfy their different interests, preferences and budgets.  The Company believes in its ability to serve retailers with a broad array of innovative connected products and quickly introduce new products to continue to allow Capstone to further penetrate this developing market.
 
Tariffs. The current U.S. administration has implemented certain tariffs that directly affect the Company's competitiveness.  While all companies in certain industries are affected equally, the appeal for these products to consumers may be negatively impacted when retail prices are increased due to higher duty rates.  The Company has seen promotional schedules cut back and retailers have expressed concerns for possible pricing adjustments that would not be known to them in advance to products being shipped.  Capstone's business model insulates the Company from paying duties as its retail partners are the importers of record.  The obvious unknown is the final impact of tariffs to the landed costs.  Accordingly, retailers have demonstrated caution in their promotional planning schedules and will continue to do so until the administration has clarified its position enabling importers to calculate estimated landed costs.
 
Tariffs and trade restrictions imposed or threatened by the current U.S. administration has provoked and may provoke future trade and tariff retaliation by other countries. A "trade dispute" of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our products are sold nationally and internationally through a direct independent sales force. The sales force markets the Company's products through numerous retail locations worldwide, including larger retail warehouse clubs, hardware centers and e-commerce websites.   Our sales business model has been designed to support “direct import sales” made directly to the retail customer. However, we also offer “domestic sales” programs which will be further expanded in the future.
 
  

12
 
 

Direct Import Sales. We ship finished products directly to our retail customer from China. The sales transaction and title of goods are completed by delivering products to the customers overseas shipping point. The customer takes title of the goods at that point and is responsible for inbound ocean freight and import duties. Direct import sales are made in larger quantities (generally container sized lots) to customers worldwide.
 
Domestic Sales. The strategy of selling products from a U.S. domestic warehouse enables the Company to provide timely delivery and serve as a domestic supplier of imported goods.  With this model the Company imports goods from overseas and is responsible for all related costs including ocean freight, insurance, customs clearance, duties, storage and distribution charges related to such products and therefore such sales command higher sales prices than direct sales. Domestic orders are for a much smaller size and could be as low as a single unit directly to the end consumer if ordered through an on line website. In order to support an effective E-Commerce business model, we will be required to warehouse adequate inventory levels enabling the Company to ship orders directly to the end consumer expediently.
 
We continue to make investments to expand our sales, marketing, technical applications support and distribution capabilities to sell our product portfolio. We also continue to make investments to promote and build market awareness of the products and brands we offer. Our sales within the U.S. are primarily made by our in-house sales team and our independent sales agencies. Our independent sales agencies are paid a commission based upon sales made in their respective territories. Our sales agencies are recruited, trained and monitored by us directly. We will utilize an agency as needed to help us provide service to our retail customers as required. The sales agency agreements are generally one (1) year agreements, which automatically renew on an annual basis, unless terminated by either party on 30 days’ prior notice. Our international sales to divisions of U.S. based retailers are made by our in-house sales team. Other international sales are made by our Hong-Kong based CIHK office staff.
 
The Company actively promotes its products to retailers and distributors at North American trade shows, such as the Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”) or the International Hardware Show, but also relies on the retail sales channels to advertise its products directly to the end user consumers through various promotional activities.
 
In fiscal 2018, the Company had two customers who comprised approximately 60% and 36%, respectively, of net revenue and 57% and 42%, respectively, of net revenues in fiscal 2017. Although we have long established relationships with our customers, we do not have contractual arrangements to purchase a fixed quantity of product annually.  A decrease of business or a loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
In order for continued sales growth in the retail market, the Company is focused on expanding the product portfolio currently offered into new innovative electronic categories that will also allow the Company to expand into different retail departments and channels of distribution.
 
 The Company is also focused on establishing an on-line presence in order to support retail customers requirements and to further support the introduction of the “Connected Surfaces” launch with the ability to ship direct to consumer.
 
Focus on International Growth: The Company will also be aggressively pursuing international business to retail customers outside of North America through CIHK for products that fall outside Capstone's branded categories but are innovative and preferably exclusive to CIHK.  This should allow for quicker revenue expansion as time consuming product and brand development efforts are the responsibility of the retailer.

Competitive Conditions
 
The consumer lighting products and small electronics businesses are highly competitive, both in the United States and on a global basis, as large manufacturers with global operations compete for consumer acceptance and, increasingly, limited retail shelf space.  Competition is influenced by technological innovation, brand perceptions, product quality and performance, value perception and customer service and price.  The Company's principal lighting competitors in the U.S. are Energizer, Feit Electric and Jasco (GE).  The Company believes private-label sales by large retailers has some impact on the market in some parts of the world as many national retailers such as Costco, Home Depot, Target and Sam’s/Wal-Mart offer lighting as part of their private branded product lines.  Many of the Company's competitors have greater resources and capabilities, including greater brand recognition, research and development budgets and broader geographical market reach.  Competitors with greater resources could undermine Capstone's expansion efforts by marketing campaigns targeting its expansion efforts or price competition.  Moreover, if one or more of the Company's competitors were to merge, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our customer distribution channel.
 
With trends and technology continually evolving, Capstone will continue to invest and rapidly develop new products that are competitively priced with consumer centric features and benefits easily articulated to influence point of sale decision making.  Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, pricing, retailer support, responsiveness, and cost management.  The Company continues to invest in developing the technologies and design critical to competing in our markets.  Our ability to invest is limited by operational cash flow and funding from third parties, including members of management and the Board of Directors.
 
Research, Product Development, and Manufacturing Activities
 
The Company's research and development department based in Hong Kong designs and engineers many of the Company's products, with collaboration from its third-party manufacturing partners.  We outsource the manufacture and assembly of our products to a number of contract manufacturers overseas. Our research and development focus includes efforts to:

· | develop product with increasing technology and functionality with enhanced quality and performance, and at a very competitive cost. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | solidify new manufacturing relationships with contract manufacturers in Thailand and Vietnam.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CIHK establishes strict engineering specifications and product testing protocols with the Company's contract manufacturers and ensure that their factories adhere to all Regional Labor and Social Compliance Laws. These contract manufacturers purchase components that we specify and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture our products. We leverage the strength of the contract manufacturers and allocate the manufacturing of specific products to the contract manufacturer best suited to the task. Quality control and product testing is conducted at the contract manufacturers facility and also at 3rd party testing laboratories overseas.
 
Capstone's research and development team enforces its proprietary manufacturing expertise by maintaining control over all outsourced production and critical production molds.  In order to ensure the quality and consistency of the Company's products manufactured overseas, Capstone uses globally recognized certified testing laboratories such as United Laboratories (UL) or Intertek (ETL) to ensure all products are designed and tested to adhere to each country's individual regulatory standards.  The Company also employs quality control inspectors who examine and test products to Capstone's specification(s) before shipments are released.  CIHK office capabilities were expanded to include product development, project management, sourcing management, supply chain logistics, factory compliance auditing, and quality enforcement for all supplier factories located in Hong Kong and mainland China.
 
To successfully implement Capstone's business strategy, the Company must continually improve its current products and develop new product segments with innovative imbedded technologies to meet consumer's growing expectations.
 
Capstone will invest in more technical and innovative product categories. These costs are expensed when incurred and are included in the operating expenses.
 
Raw Materials
 
The principal raw materials used by Capstone are sourced in China, as the Company orders product exclusively through contract manufacturers in the region. These contract manufacturers purchase components based on the Company's specifications and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture the Company's products.  Capstone allocates the production of specific products to the contract manufacturer the Company believes is more experienced to produce the specific product.   In order to ensure the consistent quality of Capstone's products, quality control procedures have been incorporated at each stage of the manufacturing process, ranging from the inspection of raw materials through production and delivery to the customer.  These procedures are additional to the manufacturers' internal quality control procedures and performed by Company staff.

· | Raw Materials – Components and supplies are subject to sample inspections upon arrival at the contract manufacturer, to ensure the correct specified components are being used in production. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Work in Process – Our quality control team conducts quality control tests at different points during the product stages of our manufacturing process to ensure that quality integrity is maintained. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Finished Goods – Our team performs tests on finished and packaged products to assess product safety, integrity and package compliance. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Raw materials used in manufacturing include plastic resin, copper, led bulbs, batteries, and corrugated paper. Prices of materials have remained lower and competitive in the last year as a result of lower oil prices and the strengthening U.S. dollar. CAPC believes that adequate supplies of raw materials required for its operations are available at the present time.  CAPC, cannot predict the future availability or prices of such materials.  These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to transportation, government regulations, price controls, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances.  In the past, CAPC has not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials.  We believe we have extensive experience in manufacturing and have taken positions to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.  CIHK is responsible for developing and sourcing finished products from Asia in order to grow and diversify our product portfolio.  Quality testing for these products is performed both by CIHK and by our globally recognized third party quality testing laboratories.

Section 1502 of Title XV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires SEC-reporting companies to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product.  Based on our inquiries to our manufacturers, we do not believe as of the date of such inquiries that any conflict minerals are used in making our products.
 
Distribution and Fulfillment
 
Since January 2015, the Company has transferred its U.S. domestic warehousing and distribution needs to a third-party warehousing facility situated in Anaheim, California.  The warehouse operator provides full inventory storage, packaging and logistics services including direct to store and direct to consumer shipping capabilities that electronically interface to our existing operations software.  The warehouse operator provides full ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), Inventory Control and Warehouse Management Systems.  These fulfillment services can be expanded to the east coast in Charleston, South Carolina, if the Company needed to establish an east coast distribution point.  This relationship, if required, will allow us to fully expand our U.S. distribution capabilities and services.
 
As the Company moves into the E-Commerce and on-line consumer marketplace, the Company will need to contract with a specialized fulfillment service which provides secured payment processing capability combined with an efficient quick response fulfilment and logistics service, at a very competitive cost.
 
Royalties
 
We have, from time to time, entered into agreements whereby we have agreed to pay royalties for the use of nationally recognized licensed brands on Company product offerings. Royalty expense incurred under such agreements is expensed at the time of shipment.
 
Royalty expenses related to such agreements for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were $347,784 and $1,282,210 respectively, a decrease of $934,426 or 72.9% and a direct result of the reduced licensed revenue in the period. The Duracell® license which had been granted for a specific product promotion, expired at the end of fiscal 2018 which resulted in reduced revenues as the program started to phase down in early 2018.
 
Hoover® Home LED licensed products also experienced a reduction in revenue in 2018 as the new product launches had been negatively impacted by the delay in promotional activities resulting from the uncertainty associated with the U.S. tariff increases on products made in China.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales for household products and electronics are seasonally influenced. Certain gift products cause consumers to increase purchases during key holiday winter season of the fourth quarter, which requires increases in retailer inventories during the third quarter. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes can create conditions that drive increased needs for portable power and power failure light sales. Historically, the lighting products had seasonally lower sales during the first quarter due to the Chinese New Year holiday as factories are closed and shipments are halted during this period.

Intellectual Property
 
CAPC subsidiary, CAPI, owns a number of U.S. trademarks and patents which CAPC considers of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other CAPC trademarks and patents.  These include the following trademarks: Exclusive license and sub-license to Power Failure Technology; Capstone Power Control, Timely Reader, Pathway Lights, and 10 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 5 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 3 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 3 LED Slim Line Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, LED Induction Charged Headlight.  We also have a number of patents pending; Puck Light (cookie), Puck Light Base, Multi-Color Puck Lights, LED Dual Mode Solar Light, Integrated Light Bulb (Coach Light), LED Gooseneck Lantern, Spot Lights, Security Motion Activated Lights, Under Cabinet Lighting and Bathroom Vanity Light.  CAPC periodically prepares patent and trademark applications for filing in the United States and China.  CAPC will also pursue foreign patent protection in foreign countries if deemed necessary.  CAPC's ability to compete effectively in the Home Lighting categories depends in part, on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements, licensing, and cross-licensing agreements.  CAPC owns a number of patents, trademarks, trademark and patent applications and other technology which CAPC believes are significant to its business. These intellectual property rights relate primarily to lighting device improvements and manufacturing processes.
 
While the Company may license third party technologies for its products, or may rely on other companies for design, engineering and testing, the Company believes that its oversight of design and function of its products and its marketing capabilities are significant factors in the ability of the Company to sell its products.
 
Value of Patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents. The validity and breadth of claims in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the extent of their enforceability and protection is highly uncertain.
 
Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us. We cannot assure shareholders that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products, will not duplicate our products, or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us.  We will assess any loss of these rights and determine whether to litigate to protect our intellectual property rights on a case by case basis.
 
We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights.  We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted.  There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others to support new product introductions.  There can be no assurance that we can acquire licenses under patents belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to us and there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available to us, if at all, on terms acceptable to us.  Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patent issued to or licensed by us will not be infringed or circumvented by others or will not be successfully challenged by others in lawsuits.  We do not have a reserve for litigation costs associated with intellectual property matters.  The cost of litigating intellectual property rights claims may be beyond our financial ability to fund.
 
As is customary in the retail industry, many of our customer agreements requires us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims. Such claims could harm our relationships with customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages and expend significant Company resources to defend against the claim and or seek a license.

Information Technology
 
The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems to manage our daily operations, communicate with our customers and maintain our financial and accounting records. In the normal course of business, we receive information regarding customers, associates, and vendors.  Since we do not collect significant amounts of valuable personal data or sensitive business data from others, our internal computer systems are under a light to moderate level of risk from hackers or other individuals with malicious intent to gain unauthorized access to our computer systems. Cyberattacks are growing in number and sophistication and are an ongoing threat to business computer systems, which are used to operate the business on a day to day basis. Our computer systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, or other events. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain our information or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our systems or an event resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or degradation of services provided by critical business systems, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business operations, sales, reputation with current and potential customers, associates or vendors,  results of operations, product development and make us unable or limit our ability to respond to customers' demands.
 
We have incorporated into our data network various on and off site data backup processes which should allow us to mitigate any data loss events, however our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
 
 
· | hurricanes, fire, flood and other natural disasters;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | power outages
--+--------------


· | internet, telecommunications or data network failure.
--+------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Regulations
 
We believe that the Company is in compliance with environmental protection regulations and will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 7 employees in our U.S. office and 7 employees in our Hong Kong operation.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We have no part-time workers.
 
The following table sets forth the number of employees by function:
 

Employee Function | Number of Employees
------------------------------------------------------+--------------------
Executive | 3 
Sales/Customer Service/Distribution | 4 
Research & Development/Technology/Product Development | 4 
Administrative | 3 
TOTAL | 14 

Corporate Information
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 431 Fairway Drive, Suite #200, Deerfield Beach, Florida, USA 33441. Our telephone number is (954) 570-8889 and our website is at URL: www.capstonecompaniesinc.com. Our U.S. subsidiaries operate out of our principal executive offices.

We file our financial information and other materials required under the Exchange Act electronically with the SEC.  These materials can be accessed electronically via the Internet at www.sec.gov.  Such materials and other information about the Company are also available through our corporate website.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to regulation by federal and state securities authorities as well as various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations governing a consumer products company and a for-profit business.  We are not subject to any U.S. federal, state or local regulation that poses, in our opinion, any special or unusual burden or obstacle to conducting our business and financial affairs.  Our main concern in terms of government regulation is the changing regulatory environment in China and its impact on our ability to access our consumer product manufacturing sources and obtain our consumer products.  While the general trend in China has to be conducive to trade and commerce, China is a still a single-party nation-state in which the central government has the power to dramatically and immediately change its trade and commercial policies and laws.  Political or military conflict between the United States and China, who are rivals for power and influence in Asia and to an increasing extent all along the Pacific Rim as well as being diametrically opposed to one another over the status of Taiwan, could provoke a change in Chinese trade or commercial law that makes it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain consumer products.  Such a development would have a serious impact on our ability to compete in the United States in the niche consumer product market.
 
CIHK is subject to the laws of Hong Kong SAR, which is a part of and subject to governance by China.  In light of the specific operational role of CIHK in our company, we do not believe that such regulation poses a significant risk factor in terms of the business and financial condition of the Company.
 
Working Capital Requirements and Financing
 
In order to more effectively support retailers in the U.S. domestic markets, so that retailers can quickly replenish their stock and reduce the impact of lost sales as a result of stock outages, the Company, as needed, strategically increases its inventory levels held in its leased Anaheim, California warehouse. Combined with investment in new product molds, product testing and outside certifications, package design work, and further expansion of its design and engineering capabilities in CIHK, the Company may require additional working capital to fund these strategic projects.
 
The Company's ability to maintain sufficient working capital is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results.  Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's working capital, ability to obtain financing, and its operations in the future.  However, achieving expected results as accomplished in 2017 and 2016, has increased working capital, provided the Company with liquidity and has allowed for the repayment of all outstanding bank notes and old related party loans.
 
Continued product expansion are critical requirements to ensure the Company's continued revenue growth.  Such projects are never held back because of funding shortfalls.  The Company allocated funds for such projects and if necessary certain members of the Company's senior management and Board of Directors have supplemented the cash flow needs as required through short term, unsecured loans.
 
On September 8, 2010, in order to support working capital needs, Capstone secured a Financing Agreement from Sterling Capital Funding (now called Sterling National Bank), located in New York City, whereby Capstone receives funds for assigned retailer shipments. The assignments provide funding for an amount up to 85% of net invoices submitted.  There is a base management fee equal to .45% of the gross invoice amount. The interest rate of the loan advance is .25% above Sterling National Bank's Base Rate which at the time of closing was 6.25%.

As of December 31, 2018, the base management fee is now equal to .30% and the interest rate on the loan was 7.25%. The amounts borrowed under this agreement are due on demand and secured by a right to set-off on or against any of the following (collectively as "Collateral"): all accounts including those at risk, all reserves, instruments, documents, notes, bills and chattel paper, letter of credit rights, commercial tort claims, proceeds of insurance, other forms of obligations owing to Sterling National Bank,  bank and other deposit accounts whether or not reposed with affiliates, general intangibles (including without limitation all tax refunds, contract rights, trade names, trademarks, trade secrets, customer lists, software and all other licenses, rights, privileges and franchises), all balances, sums and other property at any time to our credit or in Sterling National Bank's possession or in the possession of any Sterling Affiliates, together with all merchandise, the sale of which resulted in the creation of accounts receivable and in all such merchandise that may be returned by customers and all books and records relating to any of the foregoing, including the cash and non-cash proceeds of all of the foregoing.
 
The Sterling National Bank credit facility over the years has been a major contributing factor that has allowed the Company to increase its revenue and expand its account receivables. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the processing fees associated with the agreement were $45,157 and $129,531, respectively. As of both Decembers 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance due to Sterling National Bank was $0.
 
On July 20, 2018, to support the Company’s future needs, Sterling National Bank expanded the credit line up to $10,000,000 of which $2,000,000 was allocated as a Capstone expansion working capital line.
 
The Company's liquidity and cash requirements are discussed more fully in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
