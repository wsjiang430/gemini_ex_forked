  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Market Area 
 Our primary market area encompasses Dutchess, Orange and Ulster Counties (and their contiguous counties), which are located in the Hudson Valley region of New York. Our retail banking offices are located in these three counties and serve the surrounding areas. The Hudson Valley region has a diversified economy and representative industries include education, health, government, leisure and hospitality and professional business services. We recently opened a representative office in Albany County to originate indirect automobile loans. We view Orange and Albany Counties, which have larger populations than Dutchess and Ulster Counties, as primary areas for growth. 
 Based on published statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate and the New York State unemployment rate were both 3.9% as of December 31, 2018. The four counties in our primary market area each had a lower unemployment rate than New York State as a whole (Dutchess County, 3.1%; Orange County, 3.3%, Ulster County, 3.4% and Albany County, 3.2%). According to the New York State Department of Labor, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, the Hudson Valley’s private sector job growth increased by 1.0% with the region’s private sector job count reaching the highest December employment count on record. Based on published statistics, median household income for 2017 (the latest date for which information was available) was $75,585 in Dutchess County, $75,146 in Orange County and $61,652 in Ulster County, $62,293 in Albany County, compared to $57,652 in the U.S. and $62,765 in New York State as a whole. Based on published statistics, the 2017 population was 295,568 in Dutchess County, 382,226 in Orange County, 179,417 in Ulster County and 309,612 in Albany County. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the numerous financial institutions operating in our market area (including other community and commercial banks and credit unions), many of which are significantly larger than we are and have greater resources. We also face competition for investors’ funds from other sources such as brokerage firms, money market funds and mutual funds, as well as securities, such as Treasury bills, offered by the Federal Government. Based on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data, at June 30, 2018 (the latest date for which information is available), we had 9.65% of the FDIC-insured deposit market share in Dutchess County among the 16 institutions with offices in the county, 1.66% of the FDIC-insured deposit market share in Ulster County among the 19 institutions with offices in the county, and 0.09% of the FDIC-insured deposit market share in Orange County among the 24 institutions with offices in the county. In all three counties, New York City money center banks or large regional banks had a significant presence. 
 Our competition for loans comes primarily from the competitors referenced above and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies participating in the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, specialty finance firms and financial technology companies. 
 We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions, including financial technology companies, to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future. 
 We seek to meet this competition by the convenience of our branch locations, emphasizing personalized banking and the advantage of local decision-making in our banking businesses. Specifically, we promote and maintain relationships and build customer loyalty within local communities by focusing our marketing and community involvement on the specific needs of individual neighborhoods. We do not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of our deposits.

Indirect Automobile Loans. 
 We have been in the business of providing indirect financing of automobile purchases since 1999. At December 31, 2018, indirect automobile loans totaled $297.1 million, or 43.9% of our total loan portfolio. We acquire our indirect automobile loans from 79 automobile dealerships located in the Hudson Valley region and 47 dealers located in the Albany area, either under an arrangement where the dealer receives a flat fee for referring the loan to us or receives a portion of the finance charge which is known as dealer

 participation or dealer reserve. We typically pay 70% of the reserve to the dealer at the time of loan closing and retain the remainder to cover potential future repayments. 47.0% of the aggregate principal balance of our indirect automobile loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was for the purchase of new vehicles and the remainder (53.0%) was for used vehicles. The weighted average original term to maturity of our indirect automobile loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was five years and eight months. 
 Each dealer that originates automobile loans makes representations and warranties with respect to our security interests in the related financed vehicles in a separate dealer agreement with us. These representations and warranties do not relate to the creditworthiness of the borrowers or the collectability of the loan. The dealers are also responsible for ensuring that our security interest in the financed vehicles is perfected. Each automobile loan requires the borrower to keep the financed vehicle fully insured against loss or damage by fire, theft and collision. The dealer agreements require the dealers to represent that adequate physical damage insurance (collision and comprehensive) was in effect at the time the related loan was originated and financed by us. In addition, we have the right to “force place” insurance coverage (supplemental insurance taken out by Rhinebeck Bank) if the required physical damage insurance on an automobile is not maintained by the borrower. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that each borrower will maintain physical damage insurance for a financed vehicle during the entire term of an automobile loan. Vendors Single Interest Insurance, which is included on every automobile loan originated, protects the Bank against losses for physical damage to repossessed autos. 
 Each dealer submits loan applications directly to us, and the borrower’s creditworthiness is the most important criterion we use in determining whether to approve the loan. Each credit application generally requires that the borrower provide current information regarding their employment history, indebtedness, and other factors that bear on creditworthiness. We also obtain a credit report from a major credit reporting agency summarizing the borrower’s credit history and paying habits, including such items as open accounts, delinquent payments, bankruptcies, repossessions, lawsuits and judgments. 
 Each borrower’s credit score is the principal factor we use in determining the appropriate interest rate on a loan. Our underwriting procedures evaluate the credit information relative to the value of the vehicle to be financed. At times, our underwriters may also verify a borrower’s employment income and/or residency and where appropriate, verify a borrower’s payment history directly with the borrower’s creditors. Based on these procedures, a credit decision is considered and approved. We basically follow the same underwriting guidelines in originating direct automobile loans. 
 We generally finance up to the full sales price of the vehicle plus sales tax, dealer preparation fees, license fees and title fees, plus the cost of service and warranty contracts (amounts in addition to the sales price are collectively referred to as the “additional vehicle costs”). In addition, we also may finance the negative equity related to the vehicle traded in by the borrower in connection with a prior financing. Accordingly, the amount we finance may exceed, depending on the borrower’s credit score, in the case of new vehicles, the aggregate of the dealer’s invoice price of the financed vehicle and the additional vehicle costs, or in the case of a used vehicle, the aggregate of the vehicle’s value and the additional vehicle costs. The maximum amount that can be borrowed for an automobile loan by borrowers with our lowest risk rating generally may not exceed 135% of the full sales price of a new vehicle, or the vehicle’s “wholesale” value in the case of a used vehicle. The vehicle’s value is determined by using one of the standard reference sources for dealers of used cars. We regularly review the quality of the loans we purchase from the dealers and periodically conduct quality control audits to ensure compliance with our established policies and procedures. 
 At December 31, 2018, our automobile loans to borrowers with credit scores of 639 or less at origination totaled $31.3 million, or 10.5% of our total indirect automobile loan portfolio. We typically will not originate these types of loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% of the sales price of the automobile or debt-to-income ratios greater than 40%. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. 
 At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans were $223.0 million, or 32.9%, of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes, such as office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities. At December 31, 2018, $97.3 million of our 

 5

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 commercial real estate portfolio was owner-occupied real estate and $125.7 million was secured by income producing, non-owner occupied real estate. At December 31, 2018, substantially all of our commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in our market area. However, occasionally we will originate commercial real estate loans on properties located outside this area based on an established relationship with a strong borrower. We had $5.0 million of such loans at December 31, 2018. 
 We originate a variety of commercial real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 25 years, for large newly constructed commercial developments, including retail plazas and up to 20 years for almost all other commercial properties. The interest rate on commercial real estate loans is generally adjustable and based on a margin over an index, typically The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. 
 In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, including the projected net cash flows to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum of 1.25x), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Where appropriate, we also require corporate guarantees and/or personal guarantees. We monitor borrowers’ and guarantors’ financial information on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $5.2 million and was secured by a senior housing facility located in Hawthorne, New York. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
 Commercial Business Loans. 
 We originate commercial business loans and lines of credit to a variety of small- and medium- sized businesses in our market area. Our commercial business borrowers include professional organizations, family-owned businesses, and not-for-profit businesses. These loans are generally secured by business assets and we may require support of this collateral with liens on real property. At December 31, 2018, commercial business loans were $83.2 million, or 12.3% of our total loan portfolio. We encourage our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, many of which are non-interest-bearing, which improves our overall interest rate spread and profitability. 
 Our commercial business loans include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable interest rates are based on a margin over an index we select, typically The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate. Commercial business loans typically have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans, but may involve more credit risk because of the type of collateral and our reliance primarily on the success of a borrower’s business for the repayment of the loan. 
 When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial history of the borrower, our lending experience with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, and the value of the collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial business loans are made in amounts up to 90% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. We require commercial business loans extended to closely held businesses to be guaranteed by the principals, as well as other appropriate guarantors, when personal assets are in joint names or a principal’s net worth is not sufficient to support the loan. 
 Commercial business loans include participations we purchase from a single, board-approved third party in leveraged lending transactions. Leveraged lending transactions are generally used to support a merger- or acquisition-related transaction, to back a recapitalization of a company’s balance sheet or to refinance debt. When considering a participation in the leveraged lending market, we will participate only in first lien senior secured term loans and lines of credit that are more closely aligned to middle market transactions. To further minimize risk, based on our current capital levels and loan portfolio, we have limited the total amount of leveraged loans to $1.0 million with a single obligor while maintaining that the

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 total of all leveraged loans cannot exceed more than 15% of our risk-based capital (which limit will increase to 20% by the end of 2019). We also monitor industry and customer concentrations. At December 31, 2018, our leverage loans totaled $6.9 million, all of which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial business loan had an outstanding balance of $2.7 million and was secured by accounts receivable and inventory. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
 Residential Mortgage Loans. 
 Our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the borrower. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential real estate loans totaled $43.5 million, or 6.4% of our total loan portfolio, and consisted of $26.2 million of fixed-rate loans and $17.3 million of adjustable-rate loans. Most of these one- to four-family residential properties are located in our primary market area. We will consider originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by properties located outside our normal lending area on a case by case basis, preferably to preexisting customers with a relationship of one year or longer, and provided the property is located in New York. 
 We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. The one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate are generally underwritten according to Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” Loans to be sold to other approved investors or secondary market sources are underwritten to their specific requirements. We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits. To a lesser extent, we also originate loans above the conforming limits, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We generally underwrite jumbo loans, whether originated or purchased, in a manner similar to conforming loans. 
 Generally, we sell all of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate to reduce our interest rate risk exposure and generate fee income. The majority of mortgage loans we originate are sold to Freddie Mac on a servicing rights retained basis. We also originate State of New York Mortgage Agency (“SONYMA”) loans, which are sold on a servicing released basis. We may retain in our portfolio certain high quality fixed-rate mortgages with terms up to 30 years if we believe the interest rates on the mortgages are favorable or acceptable relative to market interest rates. We sold $38.8 million and $37.4 million of fixed-rate residential mortgages during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we serviced $255.9 million of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans for others. We generated $572,000 and $542,000 in loan servicing fee income during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 We will originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 70% to 80% of the appraised value, depending on the size of the loan. Our conforming mortgage loans may be for up to 97% of the appraised value of the property provided the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance. Additionally, mortgage insurance is required for all mortgage loans that have a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80%. The required coverage amount varies based on the loan-to-value ratio and term of the loan. We only permit borrowers to purchase mortgage insurance from companies that have been approved by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. We maintain wholesale broker relationships that give us a wider range of products to better serve our existing customers and to attract new customers for our mortgage loan products. These wholesale relationships provide us access to government-backed loan programs such as Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs financing. 
 We generally do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties or loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. Additionally, we do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down-payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We originate loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family residential properties. We also originate rehabilitation loans, enabling the borrower to partially or totally refurbish an existing structure, which are structured as construction loans and monitored in the same manner. At December 31, 2018, residential construction loans totaled $4.6 million, or 10.5% of our residential mortgage loan portfolio. Most of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 
 Our residential land and acquisition loans are generally structured as two-year interest-only balloon loans. The interest rate is generally a fixed rate based on an index rate, plus a margin. Our construction-to-permanent loans are generally structured as interest-only, one-year, fixed-rate loans during the construction phase. Construction loan-to-value ratios for one- to four-family residential properties generally will not exceed 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less, during the construction phase of the mortgage. Once the construction project is satisfactorily completed, we provide permanent financing or sell the permanent mortgage to an investor like Freddie Mac. 
 Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Other Consumer Loans. 
 We offer consumer loans to customers residing in our primary market area. Our consumer loans consist primarily of home equity loans, lines of credit and automobile loans. At December 31, 2018, $19.3 million of our consumer loans were home equity loans and lines of credit, and $9.1 million of our consumer loans were direct automobile loans. 
 Home equity loans and lines of credit are multi-purpose loans used to finance various home or personal needs, where a one- to four-family primary or secondary residence serves as collateral. We generally originate home equity loans and lines of credit of up to $150,000, with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% (including any first lien position) and terms of up to 20 years. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are based on the prime interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin, and reset monthly. Home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate in a first or second lien position. 
 The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include assessing the applicant’s payment history on other indebtedness, the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the loan-to-value ratio. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 
 Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. 
 At December 31, 2018, multi-family real estate loans totaled $12.7 million, or 1.9%, of our total loan portfolio. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five to 100 rental units in our market area. 
 We will originate multi-family real estate loans with terms and amortization periods of up to 25 years. The interest rate on our multi-family real estate loans are generally adjustable based on a margin over an index. Multi-family real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. 
 In underwriting multi-family real estate loans, we consider a number of factors including the projected net cash flows to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum of 1.25x), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Where appropriate, we also require corporate guarantees or personal guarantees. We monitor borrowers’ and guarantors’ financial information on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 At December 31, 2018, our largest multi-family real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $3.2 million and was secured by an apartment complex located in Pleasant Valley, New York. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
Commercial Construction and Land Development Loans. 
 We originate loans to finance the construction of commercial properties, multi-family projects (including one- to four-family non-owner occupied residential properties) and professional complexes, or to acquire land for development for these purposes. We also originate rehabilitation loans, enabling the borrower to partially or totally refurbish an existing structure, which are structured as a construction loan and monitored in the same manner. At December 31, 2018, commercial construction and land development loans totaled $12.9 million, or 1.9% of our total loan portfolio. Most of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. We also had undrawn amounts on the commercial construction loans totaling $17.6 million at December 31, 2018. 
 Our construction and land development loans are generally structured as two-year interest-only balloon loans. The interest rate is generally a variable rate based on an index rate, typically The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate plus a margin. We generally offer commercial construction loans with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less. We offer financing to purchase land for development with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50%. 
 Before making a commitment to fund a commercial construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest construction and land development loan was a multi-family construction project located in Saugerties, New York, and had an outstanding balance of $4.0 million. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
 Loan Underwriting Risks 
 Indirect Automobile and Consumer Loans. 
 Indirect automobile and consumer loans entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and any small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against a borrower. Indirect automobile and consumer loan collections depend on a borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans. 
Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. 
 Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of a project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes

 them to return the property to profitability. Direct costs may be required to rehabilitate or prepare the property to be marketed. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial or multi-family real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide financial statements on the business operations underlying the commercial and multi-family real estate loans on an ongoing basis. In reaching a decision whether to make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We generally require properties securing these real estate loans to have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25x. We obtain an environmental Phase 1 report for all loans over $1.0 million or when hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. We obtain an environment report on all commercial real estate properties. We will obtain a Phase 1 report if the initial environmental reports indicate that there may be an environmental issue on a property. We require indemnification from our commercial real estate borrowers and/or guarantors for potential exposure to environmental issues. 
 Commercial Business Loans. 
 Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans have higher risk because they are made typically on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay a loan from the cash flows of the borrower’s business and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial business loans are underwritten and evaluated primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, or real estate. Commercial business loans to closely held businesses are also required to be personally guaranteed by the principal(s), as well as by other appropriate guarantors when personal assets are in joint names or if the principal’s net worth is insufficient by itself to support the loan. The availability of funds to repay commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. 
 Our Credit Administration Department is responsible for monitoring industry concentrations among commercial borrowers and for reporting the industries represented by commercial borrowers to senior management on at least an annual basis. 
 Adjustable Rate Loans. 
 Rising interest rates may require adjustable-rate loan borrowers to make higher monthly payments that could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate loans make our assets more responsive to changes in market interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is somewhat limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on residential mortgage loans. 
Construction Loans. 
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared to permanent residential or commercial lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value before its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the lender or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing,

 rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. 
 Our ability to originate construction loans is dependent on the strength of the housing and commercial markets in our region. We focus our loan underwriting on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant.
 Loan Originations and Sales
 Loan originations come from a variety of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are current customers, business development by our relationship managers, walk-in traffic, automobile dealerships, referrals from customers, and brokers.
 Generally, we attempt to sell all of our fixed-rate residential mortgages upon origination, to limit our interest rate risk exposure and generate fee income. Mortgage loans are generally sold to Freddie Mac on a servicing rights retained basis; however, we may sell mortgages on a servicing released basis to maximize profitability and protect us from risk. We sold $38.8 million of fixed-rate residential mortgages during the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we serviced $255.9 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans for others and generated $572,000 in loan servicing fee income during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. 
 Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. The Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer’s experience and the type of loan. Our policies also limit the aggregate loans to one entity that an individual officer may approve, up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer’s experience. Loan officers are not allowed to approve loans they have originated. 
 Loans in excess of individual officers’ lending limits require approval of our Credit Committee, which is comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Vice President-Commercial Lending Director, Senior Vice President-Commercial Lending Team Leader, Vice President-Credit Administration, and other lending officers appointed from time to time. The Credit Committee can approve individual loans of up to prescribed limits, depending on the type of loan. Officers that sit on the Credit Committee must abstain from voting on loans they have originated. 
 Loans in excess of the Credit Committee’s loan approval authority require the approval of the Board of Directors. Loans in excess of our internal loans-to-one borrower limitation and certain loans that involve policy exceptions also must be authorized by the Board of Directors. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower. 
 Under New York banking law, our total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers (“loans-to-one borrower”) cannot exceed, with specified exceptions, 15% of our capital stock, surplus fund and undivided profits. We may lend additional amounts up to 10% of our capital stock, surplus and undivided profits if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. 
 Pursuant to our internal policies, our internal loans-to-one borrower limitation is set at 25% of Tier 1 capital (excluding the capital attributable to our $5.0 million of outstanding trust preferred securities), of which no more than 10% can be lent on an unsecured basis. This general standard is further restricted as follows:

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

 Commercial or Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We will not lend more than 25% of capital to any one borrower, and no more than 15% of capital to any one project or property. We may consider on a case-by-case basis requests for loans of more than 15% of capital to any one project/property. In no event will we make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan in excess of 17.5% of capital to any one project or property.

 Commercial Business Loans. We will not lend more than 15% of capital to any one borrower, with only 10% of capital lent on an unsecured basis under normal policy. Our Board of Directors may make exceptions to the 10% limit for unsecured credit for borrowers with strong credit profiles. 
 ​
 At December 31, 2018, our regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower and our internal loans-to-one borrower limit were $18.6 million and $14.6 million, respectively. Both our regulatory and internal limits will increase following completion of the offering. We expect to increase our post-reorganization regulatory limit to $23.2 million and our internal limit to $17.6 million. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had no loans that equaled or exceeded our internal loans-to-one borrower limit and no loans that equaled or exceeded our individual regulatory loan limit. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest lending relationship consisted of 19 loans aggregating $14.2 million, which consisted of $10.5 million secured by multiple commercial properties and $3.7 million secured by equipment, inventory and receivables. At December 31, 2018, each loan in this relationship was performing according to its original repayment terms. 
 Non-Performing Loans and Problem Assets 
 Performance of the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by Bank management. A number of factors regarding the borrower and loan, such as overall financial strength, collateral values and repayment ability, are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes. 
 When a loan, including a loan that is impaired, is classified as non-accrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan is discontinued. A loan is typically classified as non-accrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management’s judgment as to the collectability of principal. 
 Loans are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
  Non-performing Loans.   At December 31, 2018, $5.7 million, or 0.84% of our total loans, were non-performing loans. The majority of these loans were commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans. Non-performing commercial real estate loans totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2018. Non-performing residential mortgage loans totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2018. 
  Other Real Estate Owned.   At December 31, 2018, the Company had $1.7 million of other real estate owned consisting of three properties. These properties are being carried on the Company’s books at fair value less estimated costs to sell. All these properties are being actively marketed and additional losses may occur.
  Troubled Debt Restructurings.   The Company may grant a concession or modification for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial condition that it would not otherwise consider, resulting in a modified loan which is then identified as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. TDRs are considered impaired loans for purposes of calculating the Company’s allowance for lease and loan losses.

 12

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The principal balance of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) at December 31, 2018 was $1.8 million, comprised of two residential loans totaling $1.7 million and one home equity loan of $98,000, all of which were on non-accrual. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two loans totaling $55,000 were removed from TDR status; one loan of $37,000 was satisfied and $18,000 was charged off. TDRs at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.8 million and were also in non-accrual status.

  Classified Assets.    Banking regulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality should be classified as “Substandard,” “Doubtful” or “Loss” assets. An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as “Special Mention” if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management’s close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, thereby adversely affecting the repayment of the asset.

 At December 31, 2018, the Company classified $7.8 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which $6.8 million was commercial real estate loans, and $6.2 million as Substandard, of which $4.6 million were commercial real estate loans. $2.9 million was classified Doubtful or Loss of which $2.3 million was residential real estate. At December 31, 2017, we classified $3.6 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which $3.5 million were commercial real estate loans, and $10.5 million as Substandard, of which $7.3 million were commercial real estate loans. $2.8 million was classified as Doubtful of which $2.2 million was residential real estate. 
 The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. 
 Allowance for Lease and Loan Losses 
 Our allowance for lease and loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for lease and loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. Our allowance for lease and loan losses consists of two elements: (1) an allocated allowance, which comprises allowances established on specific loans and class allowances based on historical loss experience and current trends, and (2) an unallocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in our markets and portfolios. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review (at least quarterly) of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Loan impairment is measured based on the fair value of collateral method, taking into account the appraised value, any valuation assumptions used, estimated costs to sell and trends in the market since the appraisal date. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, management’s judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on impaired loans generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management’s judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for lease and loan losses as of December 31, 2018 is maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. 
 In addition, the FDIC and the New York State Department of Financial Services, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for lease and loan losses. The banking regulators may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis and review of information available to them at the time of their examination.

The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest previously credited to income is reversed. Interest received on non-accrual loans is applied against principal. Generally, residential and consumer loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Commercial loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest no longer is in doubt. 
 In our collection efforts, we will first attempt to cure any delinquent loan. If a real estate secured loan is placed on non-accrual status, it could be subject to transfer to the other real estate owned (“OREO”) portfolio (comprised of properties acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure), upon which our credit administration department will pursue the sale of the real estate. Prior to this transfer, the loan balance will be reduced, if necessary, to reflect its current market value less estimated costs to sell. Write downs of OREO that occur after the initial transfer from the loan portfolio and costs of holding the property are recorded as other operating expenses, except for significant improvements which are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated net realizable value. 
 Fair values for determining the value of collateral are estimated from various sources, such as real estate appraisals, financial statements and from any other reliable sources of available information. For those loans deemed to be impaired, collateral value is reduced for the estimated costs to sell. Reductions of collateral value are based on historical loss experience, current market data, and any other source of reliable information specific to the collateral. 
 This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.
 Investment Activities
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, residential mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank (the “FHLB”) of New York, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and Small Business Investment Companies. Although we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio had a fair value of $101.3 million and consisted primarily of U.S. Government securities, U.S. Government agency securities, including residential and collateralized mortgage-backed securities, and municipal securities.
 Our investment objectives are to maximize portfolio yield over the long term and manage our risk profile in a manner consistent with liquidity needs, pledging requirements, asset/liability strategies and

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 safety and soundness concerns. Our current investment strategy uses a risk management approach of diversified investing in fixed-rate securities with short- to intermediate-term maturities, as well as adjustable-rate securities, which may have a longer term to maturity. The emphasis of this approach is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk. Our Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including reviewing and evaluating our investment policy on an annual basis. The Investment Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of four directors, meets at least three times annually to review our portfolio’s performance, quality and composition, and provides reports to the full Board of Directors at the next monthly meeting of the full board following the meeting of the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee also reviews and discusses policy changes prior to their presentation to the full board. Our management has the overall responsibility for implementing the investment policy and supervising our investment activities and performance. Management is also responsible for providing regular reports to the Investment Committee to allow for a complete consideration of the portfolio’s composition, cash flow characteristics, quality and risk profile. The President and CEO are responsible for the overall supervision of the investment activity. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the implementation of the Bank’s investment policy and strategy. The Controller is responsible for the accounting and reporting requirements of the policy.
 A maximum of $8.0 million in security purchases may be made in any one calendar week. Security sales are also limited to $8.0 million per week for sales relating to portfolio restructuring. These restrictions can be combined in a single week, thus allowing a total transaction amount of $16.0 million. Federal funds transactions are not included in the limitation. There is no limit on security sales executed for the purpose of providing for the cash needs of the Bank. Any exceptions require the approval of both the President and CEO and the Chief Financial Officer and must be reported to the Board.
 Our policy is that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities that are available-for-sale or held for trading are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. Currently, all securities we hold are classified as available-for-sale.
  FHLB Securities.   In addition, we hold FHLB common stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. There is no market for the common stock.
 The aggregate fair value of our FHLB common stock as of December 31, 2018 was $1.9 million based on its par value. No unrealized gains or losses have been recorded because we have determined that the par value of the common stock represents its fair value. We owned shares of FHLB common stock at December 31, 2018 with a par value that was equal to what we were required to own to maintain our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and is necessary to support the balance of our advances. We are required to purchase additional stock as our outstanding advances increase. Any excess stock we own is redeemed weekly by the FHLB.
  Evaluation of Securities Portfolio.   Each reporting period, we evaluate all securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether or not the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) is required to be recognized if (1) we intend to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. Marketable equity securities are evaluated for OTTI based on the severity and duration of the impairment and, if deemed to be other than temporary, the declines in fair value are reflected in earnings as realized losses. For impaired debt securities that we intend to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as OTTI, resulting in a realized loss that is a charged to earnings through a reduction in our non-interest income. For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized through earnings and non-credit related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes. We did not recognize any OTTI during the past five years.

Sources of Funds 
  General.   Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances, to supplement cash flows, as needed. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, 

 19

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 investment maturities, loan sales, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
  Deposit Accounts.   The substantial majority of our deposits are from depositors who reside in our primary market area. We access deposit customers by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments for both individuals and businesses. We encourage commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us. At December 31, 2018, our deposits totaled $684.4 million.
 Deposit balances are summarized as follows (in thousands):

​ 

 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit pricing on a monthly basis and continually review our deposit mix. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates, while generally not providing the highest rates in the market, and to periodically offer special rates to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of average deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

​ 

 At December 31, 2018, $102.3 million of our certificates of deposit had maturities of one year or less. We monitor activity on these accounts and, based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe we will retain a significant portion of these accounts upon maturity. 
  Borrowings.   We borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York primarily to supplement our supply of investable funds. The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances or loans on the security of such stock and first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. 
 Our short-term borrowings consist of FHLB advances. The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on all of our short-term borrowings at the dates and for the years indicated.

 At December 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow $441.1 million under our credit facilities with the FHLB.
 Subsidiaries
 In addition to the Bank, the Company has one other wholly-owned subsidiary, RSB Capital Trust I (the “Trust”). In 2005, the Trust issued $5.0 million of pooled trust preferred securities in a private placement and issued 155 shares of common stock at $1,000 par value per share to the Company. The Trust has no independent assets or operations and was formed to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in an equivalent amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. All of the cash proceeds from the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures by the Company were contributed as capital to the Bank. In connection with our reorganization in January 2019, all of the common stock of the Trust and the corresponding subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the Trust was transferred

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 to Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. At that time the Trust became wholly-owned by, and the debt became an obligation of, Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. The trust preferred securities mature in 30 years and bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. The interest rate on these securities at December 31, 2018 was 4.65%.
 Rhinebeck Bank has one active wholly-owned subsidiary, Pleasant View Subdivision, LLC, and two inactive wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dutchess Golf Club, LLC and New Horizons Asset Management Group, LLC.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 As a New York-chartered savings bank, Rhinebeck Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation by the NYSDFS, as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its deposit insurer. Rhinebeck Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Rhinebeck Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the NYSDFS concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions, including mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with regarding classifying of assets and establishing an adequate allowance for lease and loan losses for regulatory purposes. 
 As a New York-chartered mutual holding company, Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC is regulated and subject to examination by the NYSDFS and the Federal Reserve Board. As a bank holding company, Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. also is subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc., Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC and Rhinebeck Bank. The description is limited to certain material aspects of certain statutes and regulations that are addressed, and is not intended to be a complete list or description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc., Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC and Rhinebeck Bank. 
 New York Banking Laws and Supervision 
  Supervision and Enforcement Authority.   Rhinebeck Bank, as a New York savings bank, is regulated and supervised by the NYSDFS. The NYSDFS is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the NYSDFS is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank, to issue stock and to undertake many other activities. Any New York savings bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the NYSDFS may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the savings bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The NYSDFS may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the savings bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or have been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a savings bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the NYSDFS may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the savings bank. The NYSDFS also has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it determines that the savings bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. New York consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Rhinebeck Bank permit private individual and class action law suits, and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
 The powers that New York-chartered savings banks can exercise under these laws include the following: 
  Lending Activities.   A New York-chartered savings bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, participation loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made according to applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 

 23

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Investment Activities.   In general, the Bank may invest in certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities, and obligations of federal, state, and local governments and agencies thereof), certain types of corporate equity securities, and certain other assets. However, this investment authority is subject to restrictions under federal law. See “— Federal Bank Regulation — Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions. 
  Dividends.   Under New York banking law, the Bank may declare and pay dividends from its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. Additionally, the approval of the NYSDFS is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to certain adjustments provided for under applicable law. 
  Loans to Directors and Executive Officers.    Under applicable NYSDFS regulations (which are substantially similar to applicable federal banking regulations), Rhinebeck Bank generally may not make a loan or other extension of credit to any of its executive officers or directors unless the loan or other extension of credit (1) is made on terms, including interest rate and collateral, that are not more favorable to the executive officer or director than those customarily offered by the Bank to persons who are not executive officers or directors and who are not employed by the Bank, and (2) does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Depending on the size of the loan or other extension of credit, prior approval of the Bank’s Board of Directors (with the interested party, if a director, abstaining from participating directly or indirectly in the voting) may be required. 
Federal Bank Regulation
  Supervision and Enforcement Authority.    Rhinebeck Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the insurer of its deposits. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. 
 The Bank must file reports with the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the FDIC to evaluate Rhinebeck Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. 
 The regulatory structure also gives the FDIC extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for lease and loan losses for regulatory purposes. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
  Capital Requirements.   Under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, Rhinebeck Bank is subject to a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that was established in July 2013 (the Basel III capital rules), subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan 

 24

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Rhinebeck Bank exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of AOCI. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 Regulatory relief legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) of between 8 to 10%. A “qualifying community bank” with capital exceeding the specified requirement will be considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the requirement to be “well capitalized.” The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new simplified capital requirement. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. At December 31, 2018, Rhinebeck Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements. 
  Standards for Safety and Soundness.    As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
  Investment Activities.   All state-chartered savings banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state-chartered banks may, with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market and to invest in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by New York law, whichever is less. 

 25

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit state-chartered banks and savings banks to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
  Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.   Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is considered “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. At December 31, 2018, Rhinebeck Bank was classified as a “well capitalized” institution. 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, payment of dividends, and acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including an order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, and with all transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to 

 26

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes making loans to, purchasing assets from, and issuing guarantees to, an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the bank’s providing services and selling assets to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by a bank to an affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% stockholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were previously assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories and base assessments for most banks on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure over three years. In conjunction with the DIF reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was also reduced for most banks to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. 
 The FDIC may adjust its risk-based assessment system in the future, except that no adjustment can be made without notice and comment rulemaking. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance. 
 All FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by year-end 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was 0.32 basis points of an institution’s total assets less tier 1 capital. 
  Privacy Regulations.   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations generally require that Rhinebeck Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and 

 27

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 annually thereafter. In addition, Rhinebeck Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and to not disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. 
  Community Reinvestment Act.    Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a state non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of each state non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Rhinebeck Bank’s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating was “Satisfactory.” 
 New York has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA, which is applicable to Rhinebeck Bank. New York law requires the NYSDFS to consider a bank’s record of performance under New York law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Rhinebeck Bank’s most recent rating under New York law was “Satisfactory.” 
  Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations.   Rhinebeck Bank is subject to a variety of federal and New York statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. New York’s Attorney General has vigorously enforced fair lending and other consumer protection laws. Federal laws also prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts practices against consumers, which can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and state Attorneys General.
Holding Company Regulation
  Federal Holding Company Regulation.   Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC and Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. are registered as bank holding companies with the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and subject to its regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings bank.
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing discount brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 

 28

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Capital.   The Federal Reserve Board must establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Pursuant to recent federal regulatory relief legislation, bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets generally are not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. 
  Dividends and Stock Repurchases.   A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Additionally, under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
  Waivers of Dividends by Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC.   Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay the same dividends per share to Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC, unless Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC must receive the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc., and current Federal Reserve Board policy prohibits any mutual holding company that is regulated as a bank holding company, such as Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC, from waiving the receipt of dividends paid by its subsidiary holding company. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule applicable to federally-chartered mutual holding companies, stating that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, provided (1) the mutual holding company’s members have approved the dividend waivers by a majority of eligible votes, (2) each officer or director of the mutual holding company and mid-tier stock holding company, and any tax-qualified or non-tax qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply waives the right to receive any dividends declared, or the dividend waivers are approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the mutual holding company with any officer or director of the mutual holding company having any direct or indirect ownership interest in the common stock of the subsidiary mid-tier holding company abstaining from the board vote, and (3) any dividends waived by the mutual holding company are considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form. 
 Because of the foregoing Federal Reserve Board restrictions on the ability of a mutual holding company, such as Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC, to waive the receipt of dividends declared by its subsidiary mid-tier stock holding company, it is unlikely that Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC will waive the receipt of any dividends declared by Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. Moreover, since Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. will sell only a minority of its shares to the public and will contribute the remaining shares to Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC, Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. will raise significantly less capital than would have been the case if it sold all its shares to the public. As a result, paying dividends to Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC — an entity that will not be paying for the shares of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. common stock it receives in connection with the offering may be inequitable to public stockholders and not in their best financial interests. Therefore, unless 

 29

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy change by allowing Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC to waive the receipt of dividends declared by Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. without diluting minority stockholders, it is unlikely that Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. will pay any dividends. 
  Possible Conversion of Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC to Stock Form.   In the future, Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC may convert from the mutual to capital stock form of ownership, in a transaction commonly referred to as a “second-step conversion.” Any second-step conversion of Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC would require the approval of the NYSDFS and the Federal Reserve Board.
  Acquisition.   Federal laws and regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company, such as Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc., without the prior non-objection or approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as will be the case with Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
  New York Holding Company Regulation.   Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC is subject to regulation under New York banking law and, upon completion of the reorganization, Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. also will be subject to regulation under New York banking law. Among other requirements, Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC and Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. must receive the approval of the NYSDFS before acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of another banking institution, or to otherwise acquire a banking institution by merger or purchase. 
Federal Securities Laws 
 Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission after its offering. Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. will be subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in the offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc., or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. 
  Emerging Growth Company Status.   Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (3) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (4) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, a “large accelerated filer” is defined as a corporation with at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).
 The USA PATRIOT Act 
 The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority 
 Federal law provides federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.

 FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION 
 Federal Taxation
  General.   The Company, Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and the Bank.
  Tax Reform.   On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted, which among other changes included a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company was required to re-measure, through income tax expense, the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which the deferred items are expected to be recovered or settled. The re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset resulted in additional income tax expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
  Method of Accounting.   For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. 
  Minimum Tax.    As a result of the aforementioned tax reform, the alternative minimum tax rate is reduced from 20% to 0% for all tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards from prior tax years can be applied to reduce future taxable income and are refundable, subject to certain limitations. At December 31, 2018, Rhinebeck Bank had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. 
  Net Operating Loss Carryovers.   Generally, a financial institution may carry forward net operating losses indefinitely and are subject to a limitation of 80% of taxable income. See Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
  Capital Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any un-deducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2018, Rhinebeck Bank had no capital loss carryovers. 
  Corporate Dividends.   We may generally exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Rhinebeck Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. As of December 31, 2018 no dividends had been paid by Rhinebeck Bank. 
  Audit of Tax Returns.   Rhinebeck Bank’s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent three-year period. 
 State Taxation 
 In March 2014, tax legislation was enacted that changed the manner in which financial institutions and their affiliates are taxed in New York State. Taxable income is apportioned to New York State based on the location of the taxpayer’s customers, with special rules for income from certain financial transactions. The location of the taxpayer’s offices and branches are not relevant to the determination of income apportioned to New York State. The statutory tax rate is currently 6.5%. An alternative tax of 0.15% on apportioned capital is imposed to the extent that it exceeds the tax on apportioned income. The New York State alternative tax is capped at $5 million for a tax year and is gradually phased out over a six-year period. Thrift institutions that maintain a qualified residential loan portfolio are entitled to a specially computed modification that reduces the income taxable to New York State; this is the case for the Bank.
