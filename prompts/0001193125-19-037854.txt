Property & Casualty Operations 
 CNAÂ’s commercial property and casualty insurance operations (Â“Property & Casualty OperationsÂ”) includes its Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business. 
 Specialty 
 Specialty provides management and professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and services using a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters. Specialty includes the following business groups: 
 Management & Professional Liability: Management & Professional Liability consists of the following coverages and products: 
 

ðŸŒ‘ | professional liability coverages and risk management services to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, accounting firms and law firms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ðŸŒ‘ | directors and officers (Â“D&OÂ”), employment practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms, public as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit organizations;

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Surety: Surety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. Surety provides surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states. 
 Warranty and Alternative Risks:
 Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and insurance products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles, portable electronic communication devices and other consumer goods. Service contracts are generally distributed by commission-based independent representatives and sold by auto dealerships and retailers in North America to customers in conjunction with the purchase of a new or used vehicle or new consumer goods. Additionally, CNAÂ’s insurance companies may issue contractual liability insurance policies or guaranteed asset protection reimbursement insurance policies to cover the liabilities of these service contracts issued by affiliated entities or third parties. 
Commercial 
 Commercial works with a network of brokers and independent agents to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and large businesses. Property products include standard and excess property, marine and boiler and machinery coverages. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products such as workersÂ’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs and total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace. These property and casualty products are offered through CNAÂ’s Middle Market, Small Business and Other Commercial insurance groups. 
 International 
 International underwrites property and casualty coverages on a global basis through its United Kingdom-based insurance company, a branch operation in Canada as well as through its presence at LloydÂ’s of London (Â“LloydÂ’sÂ”) through Hardy Syndicate 382. Effective January 1, 2019, European Economic Area (Â“EEAÂ”) business will be written through a Luxembourg-based insurance company. Underwriting activities are managed through three business units that operate across all locations: Property, Energy & Marine, Casualty and Specialty and managed from headquarters in London.

Property & Casualty Structure 
 CNAÂ’s Property & Casualty Operations field structure in the United States of America (Â“U.S.Â”) consists of 49 underwriting locations. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. CNAÂ’s claim presence consists of six primary locations where it handles multiple claim types and key business functions. Additionally, regional claim offices are aligned with CNAÂ’s underwriting field structure. CNA also has a presence in Canada and Europe consisting of 17 branch operations and access to business placed at LloydÂ’s through Hardy. 
Other Insurance Operations 
 Other Insurance Operations include CNAÂ’s long term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA corporate debt, and certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and asbestos and environmental pollution (Â“A&EPÂ”). 
 Other 
 Competition: The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. Accordingly, CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services. CNA is one of the largest commercial property and casualty insurance companies in the U.S. 
 Current Regulation: The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Regulatory oversight by applicable agencies is exercised through review of submitted filings and information, examinations (both financial and market conduct), direct inquiries and interviews. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to corporate governance requirements, risk management practices and disclosures and premium rate regulations requiring rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets or payments may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfers or payments. 
 As CNAÂ’s insurance operations are conducted in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, CNA is subject to a number of regulatory agency requirements applicable to a portion, or all, of CNAÂ’s operations. These include but are not limited to, the State of Illinois Department of Insurance (which is CNAÂ’s global group-wide supervisor), the U.K. Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, the Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions of Canada and the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 
 Domestic insurers are also required by state insurance regulators to provide coverage to certain insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNAÂ’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state. 
 Further, domestic insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty funds are governed by state insurance guaranty associations which levy assessments to meet the funding needs of insolvent insurer estates. Other insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workersÂ’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process and CNA has the ability to recoup certain of these assessments from policyholders.

Although the U.S. federal government does not currently directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can affect the insurance industry. These initiatives and legislation include proposals relating to terrorism and natural catastrophe exposures, cybersecurity risk management, federal financial services reforms and certain tax reforms. 
 The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks through 2020. The mitigating effect of such law is part of the analysis of CNAÂ’s overall risk posture for terrorism and, accordingly, CNAÂ’s risk positioning may change if such law were modified. 
 CNA also continues to invest in the security of its systems and network on an enterprise-wide basis. This requires investment of a significant amount of resources by CNA on an ongoing basis. Potential implications of possible cybersecurity legislation on such current investment, if any, are uncertain. 
 The foregoing laws, regulations and proposals, either separately or in the aggregate, create a regulatory and legal environment that may require changes in CNAÂ’s business plan or significant investment of resources in order to operate in an effective and compliant manner. 
 Additionally, various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to, affect the industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in court actions and by federal and state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. 
 Hardy, a specialized LloydÂ’s underwriter, is also supervised by the Council of LloydÂ’s, which is the franchisor for all LloydÂ’s operations. The Council of LloydÂ’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate LloydÂ’s underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plan of each syndicate is subject to the review and approval of the LloydÂ’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates. 
 Capital adequacy and risk management regulations, referred to as Solvency II, apply to CNAÂ’s European operations and are enacted by the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (Â“E.U.Â”). Additionally, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (Â“IAISÂ”) continues to consider regulatory proposals addressing group supervision, capital requirements and enterprise risk management. 
 Regulation Outlook: The IAIS has developed a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (Â“ComFrameÂ”) which is focused on the effective group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups, such as CNA. As part of ComFrame, the IAIS is developing an international capital standard for insurance groups. While the details of ComFrame including a global group capital standard and its applicability to CNA are uncertain at this time, certain jurisdictional regulatory regimes are subject to revision in response to these global developments. 
 There have also been definitive developments with respect to prudential insurance supervision unrelated to the IAIS activities. On September 22, 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Trade Representative (Â“USTRÂ”) and the E. U. announced they had formally signed a covered agreement on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance (Â“U.S.-E.U. Covered AgreementÂ”). The U.S.-E.U. Covered Agreement requires U.S. states to prospectively eliminate the requirement that domestic insurance companies must obtain collateral from E.U. reinsurance companies that are not licensed in their state (alien reinsurers) in order to obtain reserve credit under statutory accounting. In exchange, the E.U. will not impose local presence requirements on U.S. firms operating in the E.U., and effectively must defer to U.S. group capital regulation for these firms. On December 18, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department, the USTR, and the United Kingdom (Â“U.K.Â”) announced they formally signed the Bilateral Agreement on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance (Â“U.S.-U.K. Covered AgreementÂ”). This Agreement has similar terms as the U.S.-E.U. Covered Agreement, and will become effective upon the U.K.Â’s exit from the E.U. 
 
6 
 
Because these covered agreements are not self-executing, U.S. state laws will need to be revised to change reinsurance collateral requirements to conform to the provisions within each of the agreements. Before any such revision to state laws can be advanced, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (Â“NAICÂ”) must develop a new approach for determination of the appropriate reserve credit under statutory accounting for E.U. and U.K. based alien reinsurers. In addition, the NAIC is currently developing an approach to group capital regulation as the current U.S. regulatory regime is based on legal entity regulation. Both the reinsurance collateral requirement change and adoption of group capital regulation must be effected by the states within five years from the signing of the Covered Agreements, or states risk federal preemption. CNA will monitor the modification of state laws and regulations in order to comply with the provisions of the Covered Agreements and assess potential effects on its operations and prospects. 
 Properties: CNAÂ’s principal executive offices are based in Chicago, Illinois. CNAÂ’s subsidiaries maintain office space in various cities throughout the United States and various countries. CNA leases all of its office space. 
DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
 Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Â“Diamond OffshoreÂ”) provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the world with a fleet of 17 offshore drilling rigs consisting of four drillships and 13 semisubmersible rigs. Diamond Offshore accounted for 7.8%, 10.9% and 12.1% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling rig that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs are comprised of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a Â“semi-submergedÂ” position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (Â“DPÂ”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations. 
 A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs. 
 Fleet Enhancements and Additions: Diamond OffshoreÂ’s long-term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices. Diamond OffshoreÂ’s most recent fleet enhancement cycle was completed in 2016 with the delivery of the Ocean GreatWhite. During 2018, Diamond Offshore began reactivation of the Ocean Endeavor. The rig is currently in the U.K., where it is completing its reactivation and is undergoing contract preparation activities in advance of its upcoming contract in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, in late 2018, Diamond Offshore initiated the reactivation and upgrade of the Ocean Onyx to increase the rigÂ’s marketability by expanding its lower deck load, reducing rig motion response and making other technologically desirable enhancements sought by Diamond OffshoreÂ’s customers. The Ocean Onyx has been moved to Singapore, where Diamond Offshore expects its upgrade to be completed in the later part of 2019. 
 Diamond Offshore continues to evaluate further rig acquisition and enhancement opportunities as they arise. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to its fleet. 
 Markets: The principal markets for Diamond OffshoreÂ’s contract drilling services are: 
 

ðŸŒ‘ | the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico;
--+---------------------------------------------------


ðŸŒ‘ | South America, principally offshore Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

ðŸŒ‘ | Australia and Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ðŸŒ‘ | Europe, principally offshore the U.K. and Norway;
--+--------------------------------------------------


ðŸŒ‘ | East and West Africa; and
--+--------------------------


ðŸŒ‘ | the Mediterranean.
--+-------------------

 Drilling Contracts: Diamond OffshoreÂ’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic dayrate regardless of whether or not drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts generally also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond OffshoreÂ’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance. 
 The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Diamond OffshoreÂ’s drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally subject to mutually agreeable terms and rates at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog. 
 Customers: Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, Diamond Offshore performed services for 13, 14 and 18 different customers. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, Anadarko accounted for 34%, 25% and 22% of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s annual total consolidated revenues and PetrÃ³leo Brasileiro S.A. accounted for 16%, 19% and 18% of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s annual total consolidated revenues. During 2018 and 2017, Hess Corporation accounted for 25% and 16% of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s annual total consolidated revenues and BP accounted for 11% and 16% of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s annual total consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
 As of January 1, 2019, Diamond OffshoreÂ’s contract backlog was $2.0 billion attributable to 12 customers. All four of its drillships are currently contracted to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Â“GOMÂ”). As of January 1, 2019, contract backlog attributable to Diamond OffshoreÂ’s expected operations in the GOM was $471 million, $372 million, $217 million and $36 million for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, all of which was attributable to three customers. 
 Competition: Based on industry data as of the date of this Report, there are approximately 760 mobile drilling rigs in service worldwide, including approximately 240 floater rigs. Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond OffshoreÂ’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractorÂ’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors. 
 Diamond Offshore competes on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. The current oversupply of offshore drilling rigs also intensifies price competition. 
 Governmental Regulation: Diamond OffshoreÂ’s operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use. 
 Properties: Diamond Offshore owns an office building in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, and offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana, Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Australia, Louisiana, Malaysia, Singapore and the U.K. to support its offshore drilling operations. 
BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP 
 Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, Â“Boardwalk PipelineÂ”) is engaged in the business of natural gas and natural gas liquids and hydrocarbons (herein referred to together as Â“NGLsÂ”) transportation and storage. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 8.7%, 9.6% and 10.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (Â“BPHCÂ”) owns, directly and indirectly, the General Partner interest and all of the limited partnership interests of Boardwalk Pipeline. 
 Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates approximately 13,805 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines directly serving customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern U.S. through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns and operates approximately 425 miles of NGL pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. In 2018, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and approximately 70.8 million barrels (Â“MMBblsÂ”) of NGLs. Average daily throughput on Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s natural gas pipeline systems during 2018 was approximately 7.3 billion cubic feet (Â“BcfÂ”). Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 205.0 Bcf and Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s NGL storage facilities consist of 11 salt dome storage caverns located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 31.8 MMBbls. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns five salt dome caverns and related brine infrastructure for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL storage operations.

Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s pipeline and storage systems are described below: 
 The Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP (Â“Gulf SouthÂ”) pipeline system runs approximately 7,190 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 9.7 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 3.1 Bcf per day. Gulf South has ten natural gas storage facilities. The two natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi have approximately 83.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and the eight salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi have approximately 46.0 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas capacity. Gulf South also owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns. 
 The Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Â“Texas GasÂ”) pipeline system runs approximately 5,975 miles and is located in Louisiana, East Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 5.7 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.8 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. 
 The Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC (Â“Gulf CrossingÂ”) pipeline system is located in Texas and runs approximately 375 miles into Louisiana. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.9 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 1.4 Bcf per day. 
 Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC and Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC (collectively Â“Louisiana MidstreamÂ”) provide transportation and storage services for natural gas, NGLs and ethylene, fractionation services for NGLs and brine supply services. These assets provide approximately 49.5 MMBbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 7.6 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure, and approximately 260 miles of pipeline assets. Louisiana Midstream owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline (Â“EvangelineÂ”), which is an approximately 175 mile interstate ethylene pipeline that is capable of transporting approximately 3.3 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Texas and Louisiana, where it interconnects with its ethylene distribution system. Throughput for Louisiana Midstream was 70.8 MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 Boardwalk Texas Intrastate, LLC (Â“Texas IntrastateÂ”) provides intrastate natural gas transportation services on approximately 255 miles of pipeline located in South Texas. Texas Intrastate is situated to provide access to industrial and liquefied natural gas (Â“LNGÂ”) export markets, proposed power plants and third-party pipelines for exports to Mexico. 
 Boardwalk Pipeline has been engaged in several growth projects. Since 2016, Boardwalk Pipeline has placed into service several growth projects that represent more than $1.5 billion of total capital expenditures and provide more than 2.9 Bcf of natural gas transportation capacity to producers, power plants and an LNG export facility. These projects include Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s Northern Supply Access, Coastal Bend Header, Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion and a power plant project in Louisiana. Boardwalk Pipeline expects to spend approximately $480 million on its growth projects currently under construction through 2022 that are expected to serve increased demand from natural gas end-users such as power generation plants and industrials, as well as liquids demand from petrochemical facilities. Collectively, these projects represent more than 1.3 Bcf per day of natural gas transportation to end-users. These growth projects include three projects that will provide firm transportation services to new power plant customers, one each in Louisiana, Texas and Indiana. Boardwalk Pipeline is also progressing with the construction of several NGL growth projects that are expected to provide transportation and storage services and brine supply services to petrochemical and industrial customers in southern Louisiana. All of Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s growth projects are secured by long-term firm contracts. 
 Customers: Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, and with end-use customers, including local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines who, in turn, provide transportation and storage services for end-users. These customers are located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

Competition: Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to natural gas supply sources that are closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition, regulatorsÂ’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s traditional customers. For example, as a result of regulatorsÂ’ policies, capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s natural gas pipeline services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources. 
 The principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular, flexibility, terms of service and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems, such as modifying them to allow for bi-directional flows, to meet the demands of customers, such as power generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options. 
 Governmental Regulation: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Â“FERCÂ”) regulates Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s interstate natural gas operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (Â“NGAÂ”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (Â“NGPAÂ”). The FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s natural gas pipeline subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC covering certain of their facilities, activities and services. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s subsidiaries operating under the FERCÂ’s jurisdiction, for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services they provide, are established through the FERCÂ’s cost-based rate-making process. Key determinants in the FERCÂ’s cost-based rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for storage services on Texas Gas, with the exception of services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are also established through the FERCÂ’s cost-based rate-making process. The FERC has authorized Boardwalk Pipeline to charge market-based rates for its firm and interruptible storage services for the majority of its other natural gas storage facilities. None of Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s FERC-regulated entities currently have an obligation to file a new rate case and Gulf South is prohibited from filing a rate case until May 1, 2023, subject to certain exceptions. Texas Intrastate transports natural gas in intrastate commerce under the rules and regulations established by the Texas Railroad Commission and in interstate commerce that is subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The maximum rates for services are established under Section 311 of the NGPA and are generally subject to review every five years by the FERC. 
 Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (Â“DOTÂ”) through the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (Â“PHMSAÂ”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (Â“NGPSAÂ”) and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (Â“HLPSAÂ”). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of interstate natural gas and NGL pipeline facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline has authority from PHMSA to operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under issued permits with specific conditions that allow it to operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipelineÂ’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (Â“SMYSÂ”). Operating at these pressures allows these pipelines to transport all of the existing natural gas volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate its natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures and, in the event that PHSMA should elect not to allow Boardwalk Pipeline to operate at these higher pressures, it could affect its ability to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets, and Boardwalk Pipeline could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations. 
 PHMSAÂ’s regulations also require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (Â“HCAsÂ”) along Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these highly populated areas. Recent legislation has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with

 developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Â“2011 ActÂ”). The 2011 Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In 2016, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (Â“2016 ActÂ”), extending PHMSAÂ’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities in 2018. Subsequently, in December of 2016, PHMSA published an interim final rule that addresses certain safety issues related to natural gas storage facilities, including wells, wellbore tubing and casing. However, in June of 2017, PHMSA temporarily suspended specified enforcement actions pertaining to provisions of the December 2016 interim final rule, as PHMSA announced it would reconsider the interim final rule, and subsequently re-opened the rule to public comment in October of 2017. The rule has yet to be finalized. The 2016 Act also empowers PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim final regulations in 2016 to implement the agencyÂ’s expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s operations, which could cause it to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. For example, in 2016, PHMSA published a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas pipelines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSAÂ’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas lines in newly defined Â“moderate consequence areasÂ” that do not qualify as HCAs and requiring maximum allowable operating pressure validation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested. PHMSA has split this proposed rule into three separate rulemaking proceedings and expects to publish these proceedings in 2019. 
 The Surface Transportation Board (Â“STBÂ”) regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for interstate service on its ethylene pipelines. The Louisiana Public Service Commission (Â“LPSCÂ”) regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for intrastate service within the state of Louisiana on its petrochemical and NGL pipelines. The STB and LPSC require that Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s transportation rates are reasonable and that its practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among its shippers. 
 Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Occupational health and safety regulations establish standards protective of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. 
 Many states where Boardwalk Pipeline operates also have, or are developing, similar environmental or occupational health and safety legal requirements governing many of the same types of activities and those requirements can be more stringent than those adopted under federal laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these federal, state and local laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of delays, denials or cancellations in permitting or the development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s operations in the affected areas. Historically, Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its business, but there can be no assurance that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect them, or that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous in the future, resulting in more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities.

Properties: Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 103,000 square feet of leased office space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk PipelineÂ’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.

Competition: Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all locations in which Loews Hotels & Co operates. The demand for hotel rooms is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels & Co properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located. Competition among hotels is based primarily on quality of location, facilities, price and service. Because of the competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance in order to prevent competitive obsolescence and remain competitive.
