ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS
In 1969, Oil-Dri Corporation of America was incorporated in Delaware as the successor to an Illinois corporation incorporated in 1946; the Illinois corporation was the successor to a partnership that commenced business in 1941. Except as otherwise indicated herein or as the context otherwise requires, references to “Oil-Dri,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Oil-Dri Corporation of America and its subsidiaries.
Oil-Dri is a leader in developing, manufacturing and/or marketing sorbent products. Our sorbent products are principally produced from hydrated aluminosilicate minerals, primarily consisting of calcium bentonite, attapulgite and diatomaceous shale, which we refer to collectively as our “clay” or our “minerals.” We surface mine our clay on leased or owned land near our manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Georgia, Illinois and California. We produce both absorbent and adsorbent products from our clay. Absorbents, like sponges, draw liquids up into their many pores. Examples of our absorbent clay products are Cat’s Pride and Jonny Cat branded premium cat litter, as well as other private label cat litters. Additional examples are our Oil-Dri branded floor absorbents, Amlan branded animal health and nutrition solutions for livestock, and Agsorb and Verge agricultural chemical carriers. Adsorbent products attract impurities in liquids, such as metals and surfactants, and form low-level chemical bonds. Examples of our adsorbent products are Pure-Flo, Perform and Select bleaching clay products, which act as a filtration media for edible oils, fats and tallows. Also, our Ultra-Clear product serves as a purification aid for petroleum-based oils and by-products. We also sell nonclay-based products, such as our Oil-Dri synthetic sorbents used for industrial cleanup and plastic cat litter box liners. Our principal products are described in more detail below.
For additional information on recent business developments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Part II, Item 7, incorporated herein by reference.
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
Agricultural and Horticultural Products
We produce a wide range of granules and powders used to enhance agricultural and horticultural products. Our mineral-based absorbent products serve as chemical carriers, drying agents, and growing media. Our brands include: Agsorb, an agricultural and horticultural chemical carrier and drying agent; Verge, an engineered granule chemical carrier; Flo-Fre, a highly absorbent microgranule flowability aid; and Terra-Green, a growing media supplement.
Agsorb and Verge carriers are used in products that are alternatives to chemical sprays. The clay granules absorb active ingredients and are then delivered directly into, or on top of, the ground providing a more precise application than chemical sprays. Verge carriers are spherical, uniform-sized granules with very low dust. Agsorb drying agent is blended into fertilizer-pesticide blends applied to absorb moisture and improve flowability. Agsorb is also used as a flowability aid for fertilizers and chemicals in the lawn and garden market. Flo-Fre microgranules are used by grain processors and other large handlers of bulk products to soak up excess moisture, which prevents caking. These products are sold primarily in the United States by our technical sales force.
Animal Health and Nutrition Products
We produce, or use contract processors to produce, Amlan brand name and private label products that manage the health and improve productivity of species in livestock industries. For example, our products provide a number of solutions to health challenges of swine, poultry and dairy cattle. Our Calibrin and ConditionAde products are used in animal feed to help animals defend against a broad spectrum of biotoxins. Our Varium product promotes intestinal health in poultry. Our MD-09 moisture manager product is another feed additive for the reduction of wet droppings in poultry. In addition, our Pel-Unite and Pel-Unite Plus products are specialized animal feed pellet binders. 
Our animal health and nutrition products are sold primarily through a network of distributors to livestock producers, feed mill operators, nutritionists and veterinarians in the United States, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The sales force for our subsidiary located in Shenzhen, China also sells these products, as further described in Foreign Operations below.

Bleaching Clay and Purification Aid Products
We produce an array of products for bleaching, purification and filtration applications that are used around the world by edible oil processors, as well as by refiners of jet fuel and other petroleum-based products. Bleaching clays are used by edible oil processors to adsorb soluble contaminants that create oxidation problems. Our Pure-Flo and Perform bleaching clays remove impurities, such as trace metals, chlorophyll and color bodies, in various types of edible oils. Perform products provide increased activity for hard-to-bleach oils. Our Select adsorbents are used to remove contaminants in vegetable oil processing and can also be used to prepare oil prior to the creation of biodiesel fuel. Our Ultra-Clear product is used as a purification and filtration medium for jet fuel and other petroleum-based products. These products are sold in the United States and in international markets by our team of technical sales employees, distributors and sales agents.
Cat Litter Products
We produce two types of mineral-based cat litter products, scoopable and traditional coarse non-clumping litters, both of which have absorbent and odor controlling characteristics. Scoopable litters have the additional characteristic of clumping when exposed to moisture, allowing the consumer to selectively dispose of the used portion of the litter. Scoopable litter products are further differentiated between lightweight and heavyweight. Lightweight scoopable litters offer superior performance with the added convenience of being lighter to carry and pour.
Branded products. Our scoopable and non-clumping litters are sold under our Cat’s Pride and Jonny Cat brand names. Our Cat's Pride Fresh & Light litters created the lightweight segment of the scoopable litter market. In addition, we offer our non-clumping litter in a pre-packaged, disposable tray under the Cat’s Pride KatKit and Jonny Cat brands. Moreover, we offer litter box liners under the Cat's Pride and Jonny Cat product lines. These products are sold through independent food brokers and by our sales force to major grocery, drug, dollar store, mass-merchandiser and pet outlets, as well as through e-commerce.
Private label products. We produce private label scoopable and non-clumping cat litters. Our lightweight scoopable litters lead our private label cat litter offerings.
Co-packaged products. We have two long-term supply arrangements (one of which is material to our business) under which we manufacture branded non-clumping litters for other marketers. Under these co-manufacturing relationships, the marketer controls all aspects of sales, marketing, and distribution, as well as the odor control formula, and we are responsible for manufacturing. The long-term supply agreement that is material to our business is with Clorox, under which we have the exclusive right to supply Clorox’s requirements for Fresh Step coarse cat litter up to certain levels.
Industrial and Automotive Products
We manufacture and/or sell products made from clay, polypropylene and recycled cotton materials that absorb oil, acid, paint, ink, water and other liquids. These products have industrial, automotive and home applications. Our clay-based sorbent products, such as Oil-Dri branded and private label floor absorbents, are used for floor maintenance in industrial applications to provide a non-slip and non-flammable surface for workers. These floor absorbents are also used in automotive repair facilities, car dealerships and other industrial applications, as well as for home use in garages and driveways. Our Oil-Dri branded polypropylene-based and cotton-based products are sold in various forms, such as pads, rolls, socks, booms and spill kits.
Industrial and automotive sorbent products are sold through distribution networks that includes industrial, auto parts, safety, sanitary supply, chemical and paper distributors. These products are also sold through environmental service companies, mass-merchandisers, catalogs and through e-commerce.
Sports Products
We manufacture and sell both branded and private label sports products. Pro’s Choice Sports Field Products are used on baseball, softball, football and soccer fields. Pro’s Choice soil conditioners are used in field construction or as top dressing to improve drainage, suppress dust and improve field performance. Pro Mound packing clay is used to construct pitcher’s mounds, catcher's stations and batter’s boxes. Rapid Dry drying agent is used to wick away excess water from the infield. Sports products are used at all levels of play, including professional, college and high school and on municipal fields. These products are sold through a network of distributors specializing in sports turf products.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We have two reportable operating segments for financial reporting derived from the different characteristics of our two major customer groups: Retail and Wholesale Products Group and Business to Business Products Group. The Retail and Wholesale Products Group customers include mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstore chains, pet specialty retail outlets, dollar stores, retail grocery stores, direct customers through e-commerce, distributors of industrial cleanup and automotive products, environmental service companies and sports field product users. The Business to Business Products Group customers include: processors and refiners of edible oils, petroleum-based oils and biodiesel fuel; manufacturers of animal feed and agricultural chemicals; distributors of animal health and nutrition products; and marketers of consumer products. Certain financial information on both segments is contained in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
FOREIGN OPERATIONS
Our foreign operations are located in Canada and the United Kingdom, which are included in the Retail and Wholesale Products Group, and China, Switzerland, Mexico and Indonesia, which are included in the Business to Business Products Group.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Oil-Dri Canada ULC, is a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of branded and private label cat litter in the Canadian marketplace. Among its leading brands are Saular, Cat’s Pride and Jonny Cat. Our Canadian business also manufactures or purchases and sells industrial granule floor absorbents, synthetic polypropylene sorbent materials and agricultural chemical carriers.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Oil-Dri (U.K.) Limited, is a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of industrial floor absorbents, bleaching earth and cat litter. These products are marketed in the United Kingdom and Western Europe. Oil-Dri (U.K.) Limited also sells synthetic polypropylene sorbent materials and plastic containment products.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Amlan Trading (Shenzhen) Company, Ltd., located in Shenzhen, China, is dedicated to animal health and provides natural disease management solutions for livestock. This subsidiary sells animal health and nutrition products under our Amlan brand name and under private label arrangements.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Oil-Dri SARL, is a Swiss company that performs various management, customer service and administrative functions for some of the international customers of our domestic operations.
We own a 52% interest in a distributor in Mexico. This distributor sells, among other products, our animal health and nutrition products. In December 2018, a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Indonesia started operations to distribute our animal health and nutrition products. Neither of these subsidiaries meet the definition of a significant subsidiary.
Our foreign operations are subject to the normal risks of doing business in non-U.S. countries, such as currency fluctuations, restrictions on the transfer of funds and import/export duties; however, historically our operating results have not been materially impacted by these factors. Incorporated herein by reference are Item 1A. Risk Factors, which describes other risks that could impact our foreign operations, and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which contains certain financial information about our foreign operations.
CUSTOMERS
Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”) and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20% and 18% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Walmart is a customer in our Retail and Wholesale Products Group. There are no customers in the Business to Business Products Group with sales equal to or greater than 10% of our total sales; however, sales to Clorox (a customer in our Business to Business Products Group) and its affiliates accounted for approximately 5% of total net sales for both fiscal years 2019 and 2018. The degree of margin contribution of our significant customers in the Business to Business Products Group varies, with certain customers having a greater effect on our operating results. The loss of any customer other than those described in this paragraph would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.

COMPETITION
Product performance, price, brand recognition, customer service, technical support, and distribution resources are the principal methods of competition in our markets and competition historically has been very vigorous. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail consumer purchasing decisions, which primarily affects our Retail and Wholesale Products Group. Most of the principal competitors for our Retail and Wholesale Products Group have substantially greater financial resources or market presence than we do and have established brands. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than us.
We have four principal competitors in our Retail and Wholesale Products Group, including one which is also our customer. The overall cat litter market has been relatively stable in recent years. The overwhelming majority of all cat litter is mineral based, including both scoopable and coarse non-clumping litters. Cat litters based on alternative strata such as paper, various agricultural waste products and silica gels have niche positions. Scoopable products have a majority of the cat litter market share followed by coarse non-clumping litters. The market share for scoopable cat litter has been growing, while the coarse non-clumping litter share has remained stable.
There is significant competition to attract cat litter consumers across multi-outlet channels, including grocery, mass-merchandiser, dollar, pet and drug stores, as well as through e-commerce. Competition for the scoopable litter market has been particularly intense with new product offerings and increased advertising and promotions by our competitors and by us. We provide our customers with product innovation, a nation-wide distribution network and strong customer service. Our exceptional sales and research and development teams give us a further advantage over smaller and regional manufacturers.
We have six principal competitors in our Business to Business Products Group. Our bleaching clay and fluid purification products are sold in a highly cost competitive global marketplace. Performance is a primary competitive factor for these products. The animal health portion of this segment also operates in a global marketplace with price and performance competition from multi-national and local competitors. Competition for our crop protection products is primarily based on price, but competitor differentiation also exists in the ability to meet customer product specifications and enhancements in engineered granule technologies.
PATENTS
U.S. patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. We have obtained or applied for patents for certain of our processes and products sold to customers in both the Retail and Wholesale Products Group and the Business to Business Products Group. Our patents are highly important to our business and we vigorously protect them from apparent infringement, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for more information about specific legal matters related to our patents.
BACKLOG; SEASONALITY
As of July 31, 2019 and 2018, the value of our backlog of orders were approximately $11,680,000 and $10,338,000, respectively. This value was determined by the number of tons on backlog order and the net selling prices. All backlog orders are expected to be filled within the next 12 months. We consider our business, taken as a whole, to be moderately seasonal; however, business activities of certain customers (such as agricultural chemical manufacturers) are subject to such seasonal factors as crop acreage planted, product formulation cycles and weather conditions.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation, processing equipment, purchased raw materials and packaging, energy and borrowings under our credit facility. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of these costs.

RESERVES
We mine our clay on leased or owned land near our manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Georgia, Illinois and California; we also have reserves in Nevada, Oregon and Tennessee. We estimate that our proven mineral reserves as of July 31, 2019 were approximately 102,220,000 tons in aggregate and our probable reserves were approximately 171,441,000 tons in aggregate, for a total of 273,661,000 tons of mineral reserves. Based on our rate of consumption during fiscal year 2019, and without regard to any of our reserves in Nevada, Oregon and Tennessee, we consider our proven reserves adequate to supply our needs for over 40 years. Although we consider these reserves to be extremely valuable to our business, only a small portion of the reserves, those which were acquired in acquisitions, are reflected at cost on our balance sheet.

It is our policy to attempt to add to reserves in most years, but not necessarily in every year, an amount at least equal to the amount of reserves consumed in that year. We have a program of exploration for additional reserves and, although reserves have been acquired, we cannot assure that additional reserves will continue to become available. Our use of these reserves, and our ability to explore for additional reserves, are subject to compliance with existing and future federal and state statutes and regulations regarding mining and environmental compliance. During fiscal year 2019, we utilized these reserves to produce substantially all of the sorbent products that we sold.
Proven reserves are those reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. Probable reserves are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. We use geologists and mineral specialists who estimate and evaluate existing and potential reserves in terms of quality, quantity and availability.
MINING OPERATIONS
We have conducted mining operations in Ripley, Mississippi since 1963, in Ochlocknee, Georgia since 1968, in Blue Mountain, Mississippi since 1989, in Mounds, Illinois since 1998 and in Taft, California since 2002. Our clay is surface mined on a year-round basis, generally using large earth moving scrapers, bulldozers, or excavators and off-road trucks to remove overburden (non-usable material), and then loaded into dump trucks with backhoes or front end loaders for movement to the processing facilities. The mining and hauling of our clay is performed by us and by independent contractors. Our current operating mines range in distance from immediately adjacent to approximately 13 miles from the related processing plants. Processing facilities are generally accessed from the mining areas by private roads and in some instances by public highways. Each of our processing facilities maintains inventories of unprocessed clay of approximately one week of production requirements. See Item 2 “Properties” below for additional information regarding our mining properties and operations.
The following schedule summarizes the net book value of land and other plant and equipment for each of our manufacturing facilities as of July 31, 2019 (in thousands):

 | Land & Mineral Rights | | Plant andEquipment
Ochlocknee, Georgia | $ | 8,873 | | $ | 31,241
Ripley, Mississippi | $ | 2,006 | | $ | 14,013
Mounds, Illinois | $ | 1,637 | | $ | 2,903 
Blue Mountain, Mississippi | $ | 908 | | $ | 10,323
Taft, California | $ | 1,747 | | $ | 5,263 

EMPLOYEES
During fiscal year 2019, we had approximately 801 employees, who we refer to as our teammates, 43 of whom were employed by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe our corporate offices, research and development center and manufacturing facilities are adequately staffed and no material labor shortages are anticipated. Approximately 52 of our teammates in the U.S. and approximately 18 of our teammates in Canada are represented by labor unions, with whom we have entered into separate collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
 9

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our mining and manufacturing operations and facilities in Georgia, Mississippi, California and Illinois are required to comply with state surface mining and environmental protection statutes. These domestic locations and our Canadian operations are subject to various federal, state and local statutes, regulations and ordinances which govern the discharge of materials, water and waste into the environment or otherwise regulate our operations. In recent years, environmental regulation has grown increasingly stringent, a trend that we expect will continue. We endeavor to be in compliance at all times and in all material respects with all applicable environmental controls and regulations. As a result, expenditures relating to environmental compliance have increased over the years; however, these expenditures have not been material. As part of our ongoing environmental compliance activities, we incur expenses in connection with reclaiming mining sites. Historically, reclamation expenses have not had a material effect on our cost of sales.
In addition to the environmental requirements related to our mining and manufacturing operations and facilities, there has been increased federal and state regulation with respect to the content, labeling, use, and disposal after use of various products that we sell. We endeavor to be in compliance at all times and in all material respects with those regulations and to assist our customers in that compliance.
We cannot assure that, despite all commercially reasonable efforts, we will always be in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations or with requirements regarding the content, labeling, use, and disposal after use of our products; nor can we assure that from time to time enforcement of such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of these and other risks to our business.
ENERGY
We primarily used natural gas in the processing kilns to dry our clay products during fiscal year 2019. We monitor gas market trends and we may contract for a portion of our anticipated fuel needs using forward purchase contracts to mitigate the volatility of our kiln fuel prices. All such contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes; therefore, they do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We develop new products and applications and improve existing products at our research and development center in Vernon Hills, Illinois. The facility includes a pilot plant that simulates the production processes of our customers and our manufacturing plants. We expanded our microbiology lab dedicated to development of our animal health products in fiscal year 2019. Our staff (and various consultants they engage from time to time) have experience in disciplines such as biology, microbiology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, geological and earth science, material science, geochemistry, physical catalysis, animal nutrition, animal science, oncological nutrition and transitional medicine. In the past several years, our research efforts have resulted in a number of new sorbent products and processes. The facility produces prototype samples and tests new products for customer trial and evaluation. No significant research and development was customer sponsored, and all research and development costs are expensed in the period in which incurred. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about research and development expenses.
