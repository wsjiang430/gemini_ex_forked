Item 1.    Business
INTRODUCTION
Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (“Ambac,” "AFG" or the “Company”), headquartered in New York City, is a financial services holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 29, 1991. On May 1, 2013, Ambac emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection when the Second Modified Fifth Amended Plan of Reorganization became effective. Upon emergence Ambac had no outstanding debt at the holding company and significant net operating loss carry-forwards, of which $3.5 billion remain at December 31, 2018. 
Management reviews financial information, allocates resources and measures financial performance on a consolidated basis. As a result, the Company has a single reportable segment.
Financial Guarantee Insurance:
Ambac’s provides financial guarantee policies through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance" or "AAC") and its wholly owned subsidiary Ambac Assurance UK Limited (“Ambac UK”), both of which have been in runoff since 2008. Ambac has another wholly-owned subsidiary, Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. (“Everspan”), which has been in runoff since its acquisition in 1997. Insurance policies issued provide an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee which protects the holder of a debt obligation against non-payment when due of the principal and interest on the obligations guaranteed. Pursuant to such guarantees, Ambac Assurance and its subsidiaries make payments if the obligor responsible for making payments fails to do so when scheduled. Revenues from financial guarantees consist of: (i) premiums earned from insurance contracts, net of reinsurance, whether received upfront or on an installment basis and (ii) amendment and consent fees. Expenses from financial guarantees consist of: (i) loss and commutation payments; (ii) loss-related expenses, including those relating to the remediation of problem credits; and (iii) insurance intangible amortization. 
Ambac Assurance and its subsidiaries have been working toward reducing uncertainties within their insured portfolios through active monitoring of key exposures such as municipal entities with stressed financial conditions (including Puerto Rico) and asset-backed securities (including residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") and student loan-backed securities). Additionally, Ambac Assurance and its subsidiaries are actively prosecuting legal claims (including RMBS related lawsuits), managing the regulatory frameworks applicable to the insurance entities, seeking to optimize capital allocation in a challenging environment that includes long duration obligations, and attempting to retain key employees.
The deterioration of the financial condition of Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK beginning in 2007 has prevented these companies from being able to write new business. An inability to write new 


business has and will continue to negatively impact Ambac’s future operations and financial results. Ambac Assurance’s ability to pay dividends and, as a result, Ambac’s liquidity, have been significantly restricted by the deterioration of Ambac Assurance’s financial condition and by regulatory, legal and contractual restrictions. It is highly unlikely that Ambac Assurance will be able to make dividend payments to Ambac for the foreseeable future. Refer to "Dividend Restrictions, Including Contractual Restrictions" below and Note 8. Insurance Regulatory Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for more information on dividend payment restrictions. 
Derivatives:
Interest rate derivative transactions are executed through Ambac Financial Services (“AFS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ambac Assurance. The primary activity of AFS is to economically hedge interest rate risk in the financial guarantee and investment portfolios. Accordingly, interest rate derivatives are positioned to benefit from rising rates. Under agreements governing interest rate derivative positions, AFS generally must post collateral or margin in excess of the market value of the swaps and futures contracts. In addition, most of AFS’s counterparties currently possess the right to terminate their transactions with AFS, and in the event of a rehabilitation of Ambac Assurance some of AFS’s swaps could automatically terminate. A sudden termination of AFS’s derivatives, whether voluntarily or automatically, could result in losses. AFS has borrowed cash and securities from Ambac Assurance to help support its collateral and margin posting requirements, previous termination payments and other cash needs. 
Credit derivative contracts were executed through Ambac Credit Products LLC (“ACP”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ambac Assurance, for which fees are collected over the contract term. Credit derivative contract terms are substantially similar to financial guarantee insurance. Credit derivatives also permit certain counterparties to assert mark-to-market termination claims under certain conditions; however, the assertion of such mark-to-market claims based on the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings (as defined below) and related circumstances has been enjoined by the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation (as defined below) and orders of the Rehabilitation Court (as defined below). See discussion of “Ambac Assurance Liquidity” in Part II, Item 7 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 
Ambac derives derivative revenues from (i) changes in the fair value of the derivatives portfolio resulting from interest rate or credit changes and (ii) the value of future contract terminations or settlements which may differ from the carrying value of the those contracts.
Credit risks relating to interest rate derivative positions primarily relate to the default of a counterparty. Ambac's interest rate derivatives generally consist of centrally cleared swaps, US treasury futures and some over-the-counter ("OTC") swaps with financial guarantee customers or bank counterparties. Counterparty default exposure is mitigated through the use of industry standard collateral posting agreements or margin posting requirements. Cleared swaps, futures and OTC derivatives with bank counterparties require margin or collateral to be posted up to or in excess of the market value of the interest rate derivatives. 


| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 2 2018 FORM 10-K |

Interest rate derivative contracts entered into with financial guarantee customers are not subject to collateral posting agreements. Credit risk associated with customer derivatives, including credit derivatives, is managed through the risk management processes described in the Risk Management Group section below. In some cases, interest rate derivatives between Ambac and financial guarantee customers are placed through a third party financial intermediary and similarly do not require collateral posting.
Ambac manages a variety of market risks inherent in its businesses, including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal. These risks are identified, measured, and monitored through a variety of control mechanisms, which are in place at different levels throughout the organization. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included in Part II, Item 7A in this Form 10-K for further information. 
Corporate Strategy:
In February 2018, Ambac achieved one of its key strategic objectives: the exit from rehabilitation of Ambac Assurance’s Segregated Account (as defined below).  Having accomplished this milestone, Ambac continues to pursue and prioritize its remaining key strategic priorities, namely:

• | Active runoff of Ambac Assurance and its subsidiaries through transaction terminations, policy commutations, reinsurance, settlements and restructurings, with a focus on our watch list credits and known and potential future adversely classified credits, that we believe will improve our risk profile, and maximizing the risk-adjusted return on invested assets;


• | Ongoing rationalization of Ambac's and its subsidiaries' capital and liability structures;


• | Loss recovery through active litigation management and exercise of contractual and legal rights;


• | Ongoing review of the effectiveness and efficiency of Ambac's operating platform; and


• | Evaluation of opportunities in certain business sectors that meet acceptable criteria that will generate long-term stockholder value with attractive risk-adjusted returns.

With respect to our new business strategy, we have identified certain business sectors adjacent to Ambac's core business in which future opportunities will be evaluated. We have been evaluating strategic opportunities in credit, insurance, asset management and other financial services that we believe would be synergistic to Ambac and would leverage our core competencies. We will continue to be measured and disciplined in our approach as we pursue opportunities to deploy our capital with the goal of creating sustainable long-term shareholder value. Although we are exploring new business opportunities for Ambac, no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify or execute a suitable transaction and/or obtain the financial and other resources that may be required to finance the acquisition or development of any new businesses or assets. Due to these factors, as well as uncertainties relating to the ability of Ambac Assurance to deliver value to Ambac, the value of our securities remains speculative. 


The execution of Ambac’s strategy to increase the value of its investment in Ambac Assurance is subject to the restrictions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2010 (the "Settlement Agreement"), by and among Ambac Assurance, ACP, Ambac and certain counterparties to credit default swaps with ACP that were guaranteed by Ambac Assurance, as well as the Stipulation and Order (as defined in Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and in the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes (as defined in Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), each of which requires OCI (as defined below) and, under certain circumstances, holders of the debt instruments benefiting from such restrictions, to approve certain actions taken by or in respect of Ambac Assurance. In exercising its approval rights, OCI will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of Ambac. See Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information. 
Opportunities for remediating losses on poorly performing insured transactions also depend on market conditions, including the perception of Ambac Assurance’s creditworthiness, the structure of the underlying risk and associated policy as well as other counterparty specific factors. Ambac Assurance's ability to commute policies or purchase certain investments may also be limited by available liquidity.
Segregated Account
In March 2010, Ambac Assurance established a segregated account pursuant to Wisconsin Stat. §611.24(2) (the “Segregated Account”) to segregate certain segments of Ambac Assurance’s liabilities. The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Wisconsin (“OCI” (which term shall be understood to refer to such office as regulator of Ambac Assurance and Everspan and to refer to the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Wisconsin as rehabilitator of the Segregated Account (the “Rehabilitator”), as the context requires)) commenced rehabilitation proceedings in the Wisconsin Circuit Court for Dane County (the “Rehabilitation Court”) with respect to the Segregated Account (the “Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings”) in order to permit OCI to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or settlement of the liabilities allocated to the Segregated Account pursuant to the provisions of the Wisconsin Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act. Ambac Assurance, itself, did not enter rehabilitation proceedings. 
On October 8, 2010, OCI filed a plan of rehabilitation for the Segregated Account (the "Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan") in the Rehabilitation Court. The Rehabilitation Court confirmed the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan on January 24, 2011. On June 11, 2014, the Rehabilitation Court approved amendments to the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan and the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan, as amended, became effective on June 12, 2014.
On September 25, 2017 the Rehabilitator filed a motion in the Rehabilitation Court seeking entry of an order approving an amendment to the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan (the "Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation"). Following the conclusion of a Confirmation Hearing on January 22, 2018, the Rehabilitation Court entered an order granting the Rehabilitator's 


| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 3 2018 FORM 10-K |

motion and confirming the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation. On February 12, 2018 (the "Effective Date"), the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation became effective. Consequently, the rehabilitation of the Segregated Account was concluded. Refer to Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for more information on the Segregated Account and the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings.
Enterprise Risk Management
The Company's policies and procedures relating to risk assessment and risk management are overseen by its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors take an enterprise-wide approach to risk management oversight that is designed to support the Company's business plans at a reasonable level of risk. A fundamental part of risk assessment and risk management is not only understanding the risks the Company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the Company's business plan, factoring risk management into account. It also approves the Company's risk appetite statements, which articulate the Company's tolerance for certain risks and describes the general types of risk that the Company accepts, within certain parameters, or attempts to avoid. 
While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board also have responsibilities related to risk assessment and risk management, and management has responsibility for managing the risks to which the Company is exposed and reporting on such matters to the Board of Directors and applicable Board committees.

• | The Audit Committee oversees the management of risks associated with the integrity of Ambac’s financial statements and its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the Audit Committee discusses policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee reviews with management, internal auditors and external auditors Ambac's accounting policies, Ambac's system of internal controls over financial reporting and the quality and appropriateness of disclosure and content in the financial statements and other external financial communications.


• | The Compensation Committee oversees the management of risk primarily associated with our ability to attract, motivate and retain quality talent (particularly executive talent) compensation structures that might lead to undue risk taking, and disclosure of our executive compensation philosophies, strategies and activities.


• | The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the management of risk primarily associated with Ambac’s ability to attract and retain quality directors, Ambac’s corporate governance programs and practices and our compliance therewith. Additionally, the Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the processes for evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors and its committees each year and considers risk management effectiveness as part of its evaluation. The Governance and Nominating Committee also performs oversight of the


business ethics and compliance program, and reviews compliance with Ambac’s Code of Business Conduct.

• | The Strategy and Risk Policy Committee oversees the management of risk and risk appetite primarily with respect to strategic plans and initiatives, oversight of Ambac’s capital structure, financing and treasury matters and oversight of management's process for the identification, evaluation and mitigation of Ambac’s financial and commercial-related risks.

The full Board of Directors also receive quarterly updates from Board committees, and the Board provides guidance to individual committee activities as appropriate.
In order to assist the Board of Directors in overseeing Ambac’s risk management, Ambac uses enterprise risk management, a company-wide process that involves the Board of Directors, management and other personnel in an integrated effort to identify, assess and manage a broad range of risks (e.g., credit, financial, legal, liquidity, market, model, operational, regulatory and strategic), that may affect the Company’s ability to execute on its corporate strategy and fulfill its business objectives. The Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is a management committee, is comprised of senior level management responsible for assisting in the management of the Company’s risks on an individual and aggregate basis. The ERC produces the relevant risk management information for senior management, the Board of Directors and applicable Board committees. 
Ambac management has established other committees to assist in managing the risks embedded in the enterprise. These committees will meet monthly or as needed on an ad hoc basis. 

• | The Asset Liability Management Committee's (“ALCO”) objective is to foster an enterprise wide culture and approach to liquidity management, asset management, asset valuation and hedging. Members of ALCO include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and senior managers from investment management and the Risk Management Group. 


• | The Risk Committee's objective is to establish an interdisciplinary team of professionals from different parts of the company to provide oversight of the key risk remediation issues impacting Ambac. The purview of the committee is to review and approve risk remediation activities for the financial guarantee insured portfolio as well as review changes to Ambac Assurance's adversely classified, survey and watch list credits (as defined in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies). Additionally, the Risk Committee will provide oversight and review new risk remediation structures or approaches in connection with risk remediation plans or anticipated transactions. This committee was established in the fourth quarter of 2017. Previously, most risk remediation activities were approved by ALCO. Members of the Risk Committee include the Chief Executive Officer, Head of Risk Management, Chief Financial Officer and senior managers from throughout risk, corporate services, operations, investment management, legal and finance. 


• | The Disclosure Committee's objective is to assist the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures.

RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP
Financial guarantee insurance was sold in three principal markets: U.S. public finance, U.S. structured finance and international finance. Ambac’s financial guarantee insurance policies and credit derivative contracts expose the Company to the direct credit risk of the assets and/or obligor supporting the guaranteed obligation. In addition, insured transactions expose Ambac to indirect risks that may increase our overall risk, such as credit risk separate from, but correlated with, our direct credit risk, market, model, economic, natural disaster and mortality or other non-credit type risks. Please refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Guarantees in Force” section below for details on the financial guarantee insured portfolio.
The Risk Management Group is primarily responsible for the development, implementation and oversight of loss mitigation strategies, surveillance and remediation of the insured financial guarantee portfolio (including through the pursuit of recoveries in respect of paid claims and commutations of policies). Our ability to execute certain risk management activities may be limited by the restrictions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, the Stipulation and Order and the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes. See Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information. 
Ambac’s Risk Management Group ("RMG") has an organizational structure designed around four primary areas of focus: Surveillance, Risk Remediation, Credit Risk Management and Loss Reserving and Analytics. 
Surveillance 
This group's focus is on the early identification of potential stress or deterioration in connection with exposures in the insured portfolio and the related credit analysis associated with these and other insured portfolio exposures. Additionally, surveillance will evaluate the impact of changes in the economic, regulatory or political environment on the insured portfolio.
Analysts in this group perform periodic credit reviews of insured exposures according to a schedule based on the risk profile of the guaranteed obligations or as necessitated by specific credit events or other macro-economic variables. Risk-adjusted surveillance 


strategies have been developed for each bond type with review periods and scope of review based upon each bond type’s risk profile. The risk profile is assessed regularly in response to our own experience and judgments or external factors such as the economic environment and industry trends. Active surveillance enables analysts to track single credit migration and industry credit and performance trends. 
The focus of a credit review is to assess performance, identify credit trends and recommend appropriate credit classifications, ratings and changes to a transaction or bond type’s review period and surveillance requirements. Please refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the various credit classifications utilized by Ambac. If a problem is detected, the Surveillance group will then work with the Risk Remediation group on a loss mitigation plan, as necessary. 
Surveillance for collateral dependent transactions, including, but not limited to, residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and student loan transactions, focuses on reviews of the underlying asset cash flows and, if applicable, the performance of servicers or collateral managers. Ambac Assurance generally receives periodic reporting of transaction performance from issuers or trustees. Surveillance analysts review these reports to monitor performance and, if necessary, seek legal advice to ensure that reporting and application of cash flows comply with transaction requirements. 
Risk Remediation
This group’s focus is on risk remediation, loss mitigation and restructuring related to the insured portfolio of Ambac Assurance. 
Risk remediation helps to reduce exposure to credits that have current negative developing trends, have the potential for future adverse development or are already adversely classified by, among other things, securing rights and remedies, both of which may help to mitigate losses in the event of further deterioration or event of default, or, as available, working with an issuer to refinance or retire debt.
Loss mitigation focuses on the analysis, implementation and execution of commutation and related claims reduction or defeasance strategies for policies with potential future claims. Loss mitigation prioritizes policies, or portions thereof, for commutation, refinancing or other claims reduction or defeasance strategies.
Restructuring or workout is the focused and active process of trying to minimize claims and maximize recoveries, typically following an event of default. 
The emphasis on reducing risk is centered on reducing enterprise-wide exposure on a prioritized basis. 
For certain adversely classified, survey list and watch list credits, Risk Remediation analysts will develop and implement a remediation or loss mitigation plan that could include actions such as working with the issuer, trustee, bond counsel, servicer and other interested parties in an attempt to remediate the problem and minimize Ambac Assurance’s exposure to potential loss. Other actions could include working with bond holders and other 


| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 5 2018 FORM 10-K |

economic stakeholders to negotiate, structure and execute solutions, such as commutations. 
Adversely classified, survey list and watch list credits are tracked closely by Surveillance analysts together with Risk Remediation analysts as part of the Risk Remediation process and are discussed at regularly scheduled meetings with Credit Risk Management (see discussion following in “Credit Risk Management”) and the Risk Committee (see discussion following in "Risk Committee"). In some cases, Risk Remediation will engage restructuring or workout experts, attorneys and/or other consultants with appropriate expertise in the targeted loss mitigation area to assist management in examining the underlying contracts or collateral, providing industry specific advice and/or executing strategies.
In Risk Remediation, we have established cross-functional teams in key areas of focus, comprised of personnel both within the RMG and in other departments, to target proactive mitigation and remediation of losses and potential future losses associated with certain credits and sectors in the insured portfolio. Examples of such efforts include teams of professionals focused on (i) the review and enforcement of contractual representations and warranties ("R&W") supporting RMBS policies, (ii) RMBS servicing and remediation and (iii) the analysis and prioritization of policies with projected claims or the potential for future material adverse development to target and execute risk reduction, restructuring and commutation strategies. Members of these cross-functional teams will often work with external experts in the pursuit of risk reduction efforts. 
For RMBS insured exposures, the team focuses on servicer oversight and transaction remediation. Analysts monitor the performance of servicers through a combination of (i) regular reviews of servicer performance; (ii) compliance certificates received from servicer management; (iii) independent rating agency information; (iv)  reviews of servicer financial information; and (v) onsite servicing diligence. In addition, the team actively works with servicers and other RMBS transaction sponsors to facilitate the exercise of clean-up calls and other risk and exposure reducing transactions, sometimes with Ambac Assurance financial support. 
Ambac Assurance believes that the close monitoring of servicers, including measures to better align the interests, and other loss mitigation activities, constitute credible means of minimizing risks and losses related to insured RMBS. 
A team of professionals is focused on recoveries from sponsors where Ambac Assurance believes material breaches of representations and warranties occurred with respect to certain RMBS policies.  The team engages with experienced consultants to perform the re-underwriting of loan files and consults with internal and external legal counsel with regard to loan putbacks as well as settlement and litigation strategies (refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7. Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion on this topic). 
Credit Risk Management ("CRM")
CRM manages the decision process for all material matters that affect credit exposures within the insured portfolio. While not responsible for the credit analysis or execution of risk remediation or loss mitigation strategies, CRM provides a forum for independent 


assessments, reviews and approvals and drives consistency and timeliness. The scope of credit matters under the purview of CRM includes material amendments, waivers and consents, evaluation of remediation or loss mitigation plans, credit review scheduling, credit classifications, rating designations, review of watch list or adversely classified credits, sector reviews and overall portfolio reviews. 
The CRM decision process may involve a review of structural, legal, political and credit issues and also includes determining the proper level of approval, which varies based on the nature and materiality of the matter. In particular, formal plans or transactions that relate to risk remediation, loss mitigation or restructuring may also require Risk Committee approval. In addition, such plans or transactions that have material asset liquidity implications may also require ALCO approval.
Control Rights
In structured transactions, including certain structured public finance transactions, Ambac Assurance may be the control party as a result of insuring the transaction’s senior class or tranche of debt obligations. The control party may direct specified parties, usually the trustee, to take or not take certain actions following contractual defaults or trigger events. Control rights and the scope of direction and remedies vary considerably among our insured transactions. Because Ambac Assurance is party to and/or has certain rights in documents supporting transactions in the insured portfolio, Ambac Assurance frequently receives requests for amendments, waivers and consents (“AWCs”). Ambac Assurance’s risk management personnel review, analyze and process all requests for AWCs. As a part of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings, the Rehabilitation Court enjoined certain actions by other parties to preserve Ambac Assurance’s control rights that could otherwise have lapsed or been compromised. Pursuant to the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation and orders of the Rehabilitation Court, such protections continue after the conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings.
Watch List Credits
Credits that demonstrate the potential for long-term material adverse development, represent significant size or sector concentration, or have certain structural, credit or other complexities, but are otherwise currently performing, may be designated as a watch list credit as part of the CRM process. Watch list credits are closely monitored by the Surveillance for potential adverse development and are targets for proactive risk reduction efforts by the Risk Remediation group. 
Adversely Classified Credits 
Credits that are either in default or have developed problems that eventually may lead to a default are tracked closely by the appropriate Surveillance and Risk Remediation teams and discussed at meetings with CRM. Adversely classified credit meetings include members of CRM, Surveillance, Risk Remediation and legal, as necessary. As part of the review, relevant information, along with the plan for corrective actions and a reassessment of the credit’s rating and credit classification is considered. Internal and/or external counsel generally review the documents underlying any problem credit and, if applicable, an analysis is prepared outlining Ambac Assurance’s rights and potential remedies, the duties of all parties involved and recommendations for corrective actions. Ambac Assurance also meets with relevant parties to the transaction as necessary. The review schedule for adversely classified credits is tailored to the remediation plan to track and prompt timely action 


| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 6 2018 FORM 10-K |

and proper internal and external resourcing. A summary of developments regarding adversely classified credits and credit trends is also provided to the Risk Committee and Ambac’s and Ambac Assurance’s Board of Directors no less than quarterly.
The insured portfolio contains exposures that are correlated and/or concentrated. Risk Management's surveillance activities include identifying these types of exposures and identifying the risks that would or could trigger credit deterioration across these related exposures. When such risks materialize, an adverse credit classification may be designated across these correlated and/or concentrated exposures. This is the case with student loans and RMBS, for example, which have several correlations including those associated with consumer lending, unemployment and home prices. In the past, our not-for-profit healthcare and our leveraged lease exposures experienced periods of stress arising from their concentrated and/or correlated risks, when there were major changes to healthcare reimbursement programs, especially Medicaid, or significant weakness in consumer and business travel, in the case of the former and the latter, respectively. In the future, Ambac’s portfolio may be subject to similar credit deterioration arising from concentrated and/or correlated risks. Examples of other such risks that could impact our portfolio, and that our surveillance is designed to monitor include the impact of potential municipal bankruptcy contagion, the impact of tax reform on state and municipal bond issuers, or the impact of large scale domestic military cutbacks on our military housing portfolio or event risk such as natural disasters or other regional stresses. Most such risks cannot be predicted, and may materialize unexpectedly or develop rapidly. Although our surveillance allows us to connect the event and stress to the related exposures and assign an adverse credit classification and estimate losses across the affected credits, when necessary, we may not have adequate resources or contractual rights and remedies to mitigate loss arising from such risks. 
Amendment, Waiver and Consent Review / Approval 
The decision to approve or reject AWCs is based upon certain credit factors, such as the issuer’s ability to repay the bonds and the bond’s security features and structure. Members of Ambac' Surveillance group review, analyze and process all requests for AWCs. All AWCs are initially screened for materiality in the Surveillance group. Non-material AWCs require the approval of at least the Surveillance analyst and the Surveillance manager. Material AWCs are within the purview of CRM, as noted above. For material AWCs, CRM has established minimum requirements that may be modified to require more or varied approvals depending upon the matter’s complexity, size or other characteristics. 
Ambac Assurance assigns internal credit ratings to individual exposures as part of the AWC process and at surveillance reviews. These internal credit ratings, which represent Ambac Assurance’s independent judgments, are based upon underlying credit parameters consistent with the exposure type. 
Loss Reserving and Analytics ("LRA")
LRA manages the quarterly loss reserving process for insured portfolio credits with projected policy claims. It also supports the development, operation and/or maintenance of various analytical models used in the loss reserving process as well as in other risk management functions. LRA works with Surveillance and Risk Remediation analysts responsible for a particular credit on the development, review and implementation of loss reserve scenarios and related analysis.


INSURANCE REGULATORY MATTERS AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS
Regulatory Matters
United States 
Ambac Assurance and Everspan are domiciled in the State of Wisconsin and, as such, are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the State of Wisconsin (the “Wisconsin Insurance Laws”) and are regulated by the OCI. In addition, Ambac Assurance and Everspan are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the other jurisdictions in which they are licensed. See Note 8. Insurance Regulatory Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information on regulatory restrictions. 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Stipulation and Order and the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes, Ambac Assurance must seek prior approval by OCI of certain corporate actions. The Settlement Agreement, Stipulation and Order and indenture for the Tier 2 Notes include covenants which restrict the operations of Ambac Assurance. The Settlement Agreement will remain in force until the surplus notes issued thereunder have been redeemed, repurchased or repaid in full. The Stipulation and Order will remain in force for so long as OCI determines it to be necessary. The indenture for the Tier 2 Notes will remain in force until the Tier 2 Notes have been redeemed, repurchased or repaid in full. Certain of the restrictions in the Settlement Agreement and indenture for the Tier 2 Notes may be waived with the approval of the OCI and/or the requisite percentage of holders of debt securities issued thereunder. 
United Kingdom 
The Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") and Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") (and their predecessor regulator the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”)) have exercised significant oversight of Ambac UK since 2008, after Ambac, Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK began experiencing financial stress. In 2009, Ambac UK’s license to write new business was curtailed by the FSA and the insurance license was limited to undertaking only run-off related activity. As such, Ambac UK is authorized to run-off its insurance portfolio in the United Kingdom, and to do the same through a branch in Milan, Italy, and a number of other EU countries. EU legislation has allowed Ambac UK to conduct business in EU states other than the United Kingdom through a “passporting” arrangement, which eliminates the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in those other EU jurisdictions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A and Note 8. Insurance Regulatory Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information on regulatory restrictions. 
Regulations over change in control 
Under Wisconsin law applicable to insurance holding companies, any acquisition of control of Ambac, and any other direct or indirect control of Ambac Assurance and Everspan, requires the prior approval of the OCI. “Control” is defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation is presumed to have acquired control of that corporation and its subsidiaries unless the OCI, upon application, determines otherwise. For purposes of this test, Ambac believes that a holder of common stock having the 


| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 7 2018 FORM 10-K |

right to cast 10% or more of the votes which may be cast by the holders of all shares of common stock of Ambac would be deemed to have control of Ambac Assurance and Everspan within the meaning of the Wisconsin Insurance Laws. The United Kingdom has similar requirements applicable in respect of Ambac, as the ultimate holding company of Ambac UK. 
Common Stock Restrictions
Ambac’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation limits the rights of stockholders in significant ways. Article IV contains voting restrictions applicable to any person owning at least 10% of Ambac’s common stock so that such person (including any group consisting of such person and any other person with whom such person or any affiliate or associate of such person has any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding with respect to acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of Ambac’s common stock) shall not be entitled to cast votes in excess of one vote less than 10% of the votes entitled to be cast by all common stock holders, except as otherwise approved by OCI.
Dividend Restrictions, Including Contractual Restrictions 
Due to contractual and regulatory restrictions, Ambac Assurance has been unable to pay common dividends to Ambac since 2008 and will be unable to pay common dividends in 2019 without certain approvals, including the prior consent of the OCI, which is unlikely. Ambac Assurance’s ability to pay dividends is further restricted by the Settlement Agreement, the Stipulation and Order, the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes and the terms of its Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). See Note 8. Insurance Regulatory Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information on dividends. 
As a result of these restrictions, Ambac Assurance is not expected to pay dividends to Ambac for the foreseeable future. 
While the UK insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on an insurer’s ability to declare a dividend, the PRA’s and FCA’s capital requirements in practice act as a restriction on the payment of dividends, where a firm has a lower level of regulatory capital than its regulatory capital requirement as is the case for Ambac UK. Further, the FSA amended Ambac UK’s license in 2010 such that the PRA must specifically approve (“non-objection”) any transfer of value and/or assets from Ambac UK to Ambac Assurance or any other Ambac group company, other than in respect of certain disclosed contracts between the two parties (such as in respect of a management services agreement between Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK). As a result, Ambac UK is not expected to pay any dividends to Ambac Assurance for the foreseeable future. 
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes, Ambac Assurance may not make any “Restricted Payment” (which includes dividends from Ambac Assurance to Ambac) in excess of $5 million in the aggregate per annum, other than Restricted Payments from Ambac Assurance to Ambac in an amount up to $7.5 million per annum solely to pay operating expenses of Ambac. Concurrent with making any such Restricted Payment, a pro rata amount of Ambac Assurance's surplus notes (other than junior surplus notes) would also need to be redeemed at par. Any such payment on surplus notes would require either payment or collateralization of a proportional amount of the Tier 


2 Notes (or interest thereon) in accordance with the terms of the Tier 2 Note indenture. 
The Stipulation and Order requires OCI approval for the payment of any dividend or distribution on the common stock of Ambac Assurance.
Under the terms of Ambac Assurance’s AMPS, dividends may not be paid on the common stock of Ambac Assurance unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the AMPS for the then current dividend period have been paid, provided, that dividends on the common stock may be made at all times for the purpose of, and only in such amounts as are necessary for, enabling Ambac (i) to service its indebtedness for borrowed money as such payments become due or (ii) to pay its operating expenses. If dividends are paid on the common stock as provided in the prior sentence, dividends on the AMPS become cumulative until the date that all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been paid on the AMPS.
