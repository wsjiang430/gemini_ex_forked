Item 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our lead product candidate, entinostat is a once-weekly, oral, small molecule, Class I HDAC inhibitor currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with exemestane for advanced hormone receptor positive, or HR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, or HER2-, breast cancer, an indication for which it has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA. Entinostat has been shown to block the function of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, and is being evaluated in combination with several approved PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists, including in Phase 1b/2 clinical trials combining entinostat with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) from Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma; and with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) from Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, for advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer.
 Our second clinical-stage product candidate, SNDX-6352, is a monoclonal antibody that targets the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In many cancers, inhibition of CSF-1R will reduce the number of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, or TAMs, and enable an immune response against tumors. We expect topline results and a recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, and schedule from the Phase 1/1b trial of SNDX-6352, alone or in combination with Imfinzi® (durvalumab), from AstraZeneca plc, in the second quarter of 2019.  We are also expecting topline results and a RP2D and schedule from the Phase 1 trial of SNDX-6352 in patients with chronic graft versus host disease, or cGVHD, in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 In the third quarter of 2018, development of our portfolio of preclinical, orally-available, small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of Menin with the mixed lineage leukemia, or MLL, protein led to our selection of a lead compound, SNDX-5613, to continue through IND-enabling studies. We are developing SNDX-5613 as a targeted therapy to potentially treat two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged, or MLLr, a genetically-defined subset of acute leukemias with chromosomal rearrangements in the MLL gene; and (ii) acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with a mutated nucleophosmin 1, or NPM1, characterized by a somatic mutation in the NPM1 gene, or NPM1c. We expect to file an IND with the FDA in the second quarter of 2019 and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in leukemia patients having relapsed or refractory MLLr or NPM1c AML soon after.
 We plan to continue to leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to opportunistically license, acquire and develop additional cancer therapies to expand our pipeline. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are developing entinostat, SNDX-6352 and SNDX-5613 for use in multiple cancer and potentially other indications in combination with complementary therapeutic drugs and potentially as single agents. Key elements of our strategy include: 

• | Develop and obtain regulatory approval for entinostat in combination with hormone therapy in advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Based on the positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, we received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for entinostat in combination with exemestane in advanced HR+ breast cancer. We believe that the submission of the overall survival, or OS, results of the Phase 3 clinical trial, if successful, would be sufficient for regulatory approval of entinostat in the United States.

• | Develop SNDX-5613 for the treatment of MLL-r driven malignancies. We believe that SNDX-5613 has the potential to treat at least two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) MLLr, a genetically-defined subset of acute leukemias with chromosomal rearrangements in the MLL gene; and (ii) NPM1c AML, characterized by a somatic mutation in the NPM1 gene. We conducted preclinical studies in 2018 and plan to file an IND in the second quarter of 2019.

• | Establish entinostat as the combination therapy of choice with immune checkpoint inhibitors, initially PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, by conducting clinical trials in patients where we believe the response to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors can be improved. To that end, we have entered into non-exclusive collaborations with Merck, Genentech, and Merck KGaA and Pfizer. We are currently prioritizing our resources ahead of the Phase 3 clinical trial OS readout, at which time we will make a determination on next steps for the immuno-oncology combination program.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop SNDX-6352 as monotherapy and in combination in one or more tumor types. We are currently looking to establish a recommended phase 2 dose for use of SNDX-6352 as a monotherapy or combination agent in solid tumors. We are also conducting a Phase 1 trial of SNDX-6352 as a monotherapy in patients with cGVHD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional cancer therapies to expand our pipeline. We acquired the exclusive rights to SNDX-6352 in 2016 and to SNDX-5613 in 2017. We intend to continue leveraging the collective talent within our organization and network of advisors to guide our pipeline expansion and development plans.

Our Pipeline
 
Entinostat 
 Entinostat is our oral, small molecule product candidate that has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, potentially enhancing the body’s immune response to tumors. The favorable safety profile of entinostat has been demonstrated in clinical trials in more than 1,200 cancer patients. The long half-life of entinostat allows for continuous exposure to therapy potentially resulting in positive efficacy benefits without corresponding cytotoxic effects. Another benefit of entinostat’s long half-life is the potential to minimize the frequency of dosing and reduce the severity and frequency of adverse events. Based on entinostat’s ability to reverse hormone resistance, alter cancer stem cells, and modulate immunosensitivity, we believe entinostat may have broad applications in tumor types which have become resistant to hormone and/or immunotherapy.

Entinostat has also been shown to enhance the immune system’s ability to identify and target tumor cells. It is now widely accepted that many tumors have the ability to evade the immune system either through direct cellular interactions and recruitment of immuno-suppressive cells to the area surrounding the tumor, or through parallel evasion-mechanisms focused on the interaction between the T cell with other immune cells found within the surrounding tumor microenvironment. Entinostat has been observed to decrease the population of immuno-suppressive cells known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, and regulatory T cells, or Tregs, which localize in the area surrounding the tumor and block T cells from killing cancer cells, while sparing the cytotoxic T cells. Through blocking the immuno-suppressive effects of MDSCs and Tregs, we believe entinostat has the potential to be used synergistically with therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, resulting in the increased ability of the T cells to attack the tumor.
 Entinostat in Advanced HR+ Breast Cancer
 We are evaluating entinostat in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial testing exemestane in combination with entinostat versus exemestane in combination with placebo in patients with advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer. ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, or ECOG-ACRIN, is conducting this clinical trial under sponsorship and funding support from the National Cancer Institute, or NCI. The Phase 3 clinical trial was designed to determine whether the addition of entinostat to exemestane improves progression-free survival, or PFS, OS, or both in patients who have previously progressed after treatment with standard-of-care hormonal agents.
 To confirm the PFS and OS benefits observed in the Phase 2b clinical trial, we collaborated with ECOG-ACRIN to develop and conduct the Phase 3 clinical trial, E2112. ECOG-ACRIN is conducting the trial under sponsorship and funding support from the NCI. We are providing financial and operational support for the Phase 3 clinical trial under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the NCI and a separate agreement with ECOG-ACRIN. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of entinostat in combination with exemestane compared to exemestane and a placebo. The protocol for the Phase 3 clinical trial was reviewed and agreed upon by the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with the NCI in January 2014.
 Syndax, the NCI and ECOG-ACRIN designed the trial to evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to exemestane improves PFS, OS or both PFS and OS in patients with advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer who have previously progressed after treatment with standard of care hormonal agents such as NSAIs or Faslodex. In November 2017, ECOG-ACRIN notified us that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, or DSMC, completed the final PFS analysis and the first interim analysis for OS. The results of this analysis are held confidentially by the ECOG-ACRIN study statistician and the DSMC until the trial completed enrollment. 
 In October 2018, we announced that enrollment in E2112 concluded, with a total of 608 patients enrolled. ECOG-ACRIN and NCI conducted the primary analysis of PFS after 247 PFS events occurred among the initial 360 patients enrolled and informed us that the trial did not meet the high statistical hurdle for the first primary endpoint of improving PFS. Although a positive result on PFS would have provided the earliest regulatory filing opportunity, it does not impact the potential for the trial to achieve the OS endpoint. Following the most recent interim OS analysis also conducted by the trial’s DSMC in October 2018, ECOG-ACRIN informed us that the trial is continuing as planned, with the next interim analysis for the OS primary endpoint scheduled for the second quarter of 2019.
 The DSMC will conduct additional interim analyses every six months until either it observes an OS benefit, or the final target number of events occur. E2112 was designed, and obtained breakthrough therapy designation for this indication, based on positive Phase 2b OS results. Any positive OS assessment would enable us to file for full regulatory approval. 
 Entinostat in Immuno-Oncology 
 Entinostat is currently being studied in clinical trials across a broad range of solid tumors, including breast, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, melanoma, ovarian and microsatellite stable colorectal carcinoma, or MSS-CRC.

We are working in collaboration with Merck to study the combination of entinostat with Merck’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial (ENCORE 601) of up to approximately 202 patients with NSCLC, melanoma or MSS-CRC. The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of the trial was to determine the dose-limiting toxicities, or DLT, maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and the RP2D of entinostat given in combination with Keytruda, which we confirmed as weekly oral doses of 5 mg. The Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial also characterized the effect of the combination therapy on numerous biomarkers, including expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, the number and function of different types of T cells and the number of MDSCs. We are assessing these biomarkers both in peripheral blood and in serial tumor biopsies. We announced safety data, data from the Phase 1b portion and initiated patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion in 2016.
 The Phase 2 portion employs a two-stage design in which a defined minimum number of responders must be seen in the first stage for the cohort to advance to full enrollment in the second stage. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion of the trial was designed to evaluate the results from these first cohorts and make an informed decision around expanding and progressing any, all or none of the cohorts into the next stage of the trial only after attaining a certain pre-specified and meaningful level of objective response in each cohort. We have completed enrollment of the first stage of the Phase 2 portion for all four cohorts.
 In the first half of 2017, both the PD-L1 pretreated melanoma and PD-L1 pretreated NSCLC cohorts of ENCORE 601 met the pre-specified objective response threshold and progressed to the second stage of the trial.  The melanoma cohort completed enrollment after the addition of 42 patients for a total of 55 patients enrolled. We shared data in the second quarter of 2018 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, showing that a total of six confirmed partial responses and three unconfirmed partial responses were observed in the 34 evaluable patients at the time of the data cut-off.
 Similarly, the cohort enrolling PD-L1 pretreated NSCLC patients enrolled an additional 39 patients in the second stage of the trial.  Enrollment completed with a total of 70 patients in this arm and we presented the full clinical data set in the third quarter of 2018 at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. At the time of data cut-off, there were seven confirmed partial responses among the overall population of 72 efficacy-evaluable patients, for a ten percent objective response rate, a median duration of response of 5.3 months, and a median PFS of 2.8 months. In October 2018, we announced plans to commence a focused, biomarker-driven, randomized registration trial in NSCLC comparing the entinostat-Keytruda combination to standard of care chemotherapy in patients whose disease has progressed after both platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1 antagonist therapy. We have recently completed a full portfolio prioritization assessment and have determined to place the initiation of this trial on hold until we receive final OS results from E2112.
 In the second half of 2017, we announced that the cohort enrolling PD-L1 naïve NSCLC patients also met the established criteria to advance to stage two, however due to the changing landscape in this patient population, we decided to not progress this cohort into the second stage of the Phase 2 trial. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion of the MSS-CRC cohort completed enrollment in the third quarter of 2017 and we completed the expanded enrollment to 37 patients in the third quarter of 2018. Based on the lack of activity observed to date in this indication, we have decided not to advance to the second stage of the study.
 We also entered into a collaboration with Genentech to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of entinostat in combination with Genentech’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, ENCORE 602, of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC. The Phase 1b portion established the safety and RP2D of entinostat of in the combination and completed in November 2016. The Phase 2 portion, which opened in December 2016, has PFS as the primary endpoint with response rate, duration of response, time to response and OS as secondary end points. This trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in PFS for the combination regimen versus Tecentriq monotherapy. The Phase 2 trial randomized 81 patients to receive 1200 mg Tecentriq every three weeks in combination with either 5 mg of entinostat (n=40) or placebo (n=41) once weekly.

In January 2018, we entered into a second clinical collaboration with Genentech to evaluate the combination of entinostat with Tecentriq in patients with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer in a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial that will enroll patients with metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer who have experienced disease progression during or following treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Genentech is responsible for conducting the trial and has initiated patient enrollment. 
 We also entered into a collaboration with Ares Trading, S.A., a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer Inc. to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of entinostat in combination with Bavencio® (avelumab), their monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, ENCORE 603, of patients with ovarian cancer. The Phase 1b portion established the safety of weekly, oral entinostat in combination with Bavencio. The Phase 2 portion, which began in the third quarter of 2017, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with PFS as the primary endpoint and response rate, duration of response, time to response and OS as secondary end points. This trial did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in PFS for the combination regimen compared with Bavencio monotherapy. The Phase 2 trial randomized 126 patients to receive 10 mg/kg Bavencio every two weeks in combination with either 5 mg of entinostat (N=85) or placebo (N=41) once weekly. 
 We designed these series of immune-oncology trials to test whether entinostat could enhance the activity of PD1 pathway antagonists across a number of immunologic environments. NSCLC and melanoma represent settings where the tumors are infiltrated with T cells, MSS-CRC and TNBC are characterized as excluded where the T cells cannot enter the tumor and organize around the edges of the tumor, and ovarian cancer which is characterized by having an absence of T-cells. The data that we have received thus far from clinical trials of entinostat in immuno-oncology suggests that entinostat has the ability to overcome resistance in PD-1 refractory patients in NSCLC and melanoma, but was not supportive of continued study in MSS-CRC, TNBC and ovarian cancer.  We believe that results to date from our ENCORE program support that entinostat’s beneficial effect is evident in tumors that have been infiltrated with T cells, or inflamed tumors, and not in the other immunologic settings.
 Additionally, entinostat is being evaluated in over 10 ongoing and additional planned investigator-sponsored clinical trials that are designed to provide further validation of entinostat’s immuno-modulatory activity in various other immuno-responsive tumors. We believe that there may be further opportunities through these and additional collaborations to expand the indications in which entinostat may target immunologic mechanisms of resistance to cancer therapies.
 SNDX-6352 
 SNDX-6352 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to CSF-1R. CSF-1R is expressed on the surface of specific immuno-suppressive cells (e.g., TAMs) known to play a role in the growth, survival, and metastases of cancer. Inhibition of CSF-1R is thought to disrupt the activity of TAMs, resulting in a decrease in the immunosuppressive environment immediately surrounding the tumor, or tumor micro-environment. This mode of action is thought to make CSF-1R inhibitors well suited for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in cancers where there may be limited activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy. We believe that SNDX-6352 has the potential to be used to treat a variety of cancers in combination with entinostat and with other oncology agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiation, and chemotherapy.
 We are developing SNDX-6352 to bind to CSF-1R and block the ability of CSF-1 and IL-34 to bind to and activate CSF-1R signaling. Our near-term focus is to rapidly establish proof of concept that SNDX-6352 can provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients in one or more tumor types when combined with standard of care therapies for a given indication. We intend to conduct clinical trials in patients with tumor types having clear unmet needs (e.g., NSCLC, TNBC, prostate, melanoma, pancreatic, ovarian, bladder) and where we believe that the inhibition of TAMs via CSF-1R inhibition will produce meaningful benefits for patients, such as chronic graft versus host disease. 
 We commenced SNDX-6352-502, a Phase 1 dose escalation trial, in the third quarter of 2017. In addition to assessing safety at increasing doses of SNDX-6352, this trial will provide information on the concentration of SNDX-6352 and levels of CSF-1, IL-34 and non-classical monocytes in the blood. We are conducting the trial at multiple centers in the United States and expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 1 trial by the end of second 
 5


quarter of 2019.  We expect to utilize the safety assessment of SNDX-6352 to determine the starting dose for subsequent clinical trials testing multiple doses of SNDX-6352 as a single agent and in combinations. 
 In early 2018, we expanded SNDX-6352-502 to include a Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluating the safety of SNDX-6352 in combination with Imfinzi, AstraZeneca’s human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1. These cohorts will also provide information on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the combination. We anticipate identifying the RP2D and schedule for SNDX-6352 in combination with Imfinzi in the second quarter of 2019.
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we opened enrollment in SNDX-6352-503, a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of SNDX-6352 in patients with cGVHD. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of SNDX-6352 in cGVHD and to identify a RP2D and schedule. We expect to receive initial results in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 SNDX-5613
 SNDX-5613 is a potent, orally active inhibitor of the high affinity interaction site on menin with the protein MLL1. This specific interaction is a key driver for two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) MLLr and (ii) NPM1c AML.  Both diseases have a poor prognosis with an unmet need. In preclinical testing, SNDX-5613 has demonstrated complete tumor regression and profound, dose-dependent survival benefit in leukemic models of disease. SNDX-5613 is a targeted therapy that we are developing initially as a treatment for leukemia patients having relapsed or refractory MLLr or NPM1c AML. We anticipate filing an IND in the second quarter of 2019 and initiating the clinical program shortly thereafter.  
 Market and Competition
 Entinostat in Advanced HR+ Breast Cancer 
 Patients in the United States with advanced HR+ breast cancer are treated with hormone therapies with the goal to prolong OS and to delay treatment with more toxic chemotherapies. Hormone therapies are designed to inhibit estrogen stimulation of advanced HR+ breast cancers. Due to limited efficacy of hormone therapies in the advanced HR+ breast cancer setting, multiple lines of treatment are typically used, with each additional line of hormone therapy resulting in a shorter PFS and lower OS. The cause of resistance is multi-factorial and results in tumor progression independent of estrogen stimulation. In 2016, approximately 34,000 patients with HR+ breast cancer were treated with a hormone therapy as second-line or later treatment in the United States. The median OS for advanced HR+ breast cancer in the second-line setting is approximately two years.
 The FDA has approved the use of Afinitor® (everolimus), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, for use in combination with exemestane, based on a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial which resulted in a median PFS benefit of 7.8 months for patients receiving Afinitor-exemestane and 3.2 months for patients receiving exemestane alone, but no statistically significant improvement in OS. 
 More recently, the FDA granted approval to three cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, or CDK4/6, inhibitors, Ibrance® (palbociclib), Kisqali® (ribociclib) and Verzenio® (abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with metastatic disease. Based on the significant PFS benefit observed in combination with endocrine therapy, these agents have been adopted as standard of care treatment, with patients increasingly receiving a CDK4/6 therapy in the front-line setting.
 While the treatment of advanced HR+ breast cancer is evolving given the introduction of multiple combination therapies, we believe physicians will welcome the introduction of a well-tolerated therapy that improves OS, which has not been demonstrated to date for Afinitor or the CDK 4/6 inhibitors in combination with hormone therapy. We believe current data suggests that entinostat could demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile and an improvement in OS, and thus may become a preferred treatment option for patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer who have stopped responding to their first line endocrine-based regimen.

Entinostat with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in NSCLC, Melanoma
 NSCLC 
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, with more people dying of lung cancer each year than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 80% to 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC; and in 2017, an estimated 222,500 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, and an estimated 155,870 people died from lung cancer in the United States. The five-year survival rate for patients with lung cancer generally is 18% and for patients with Stage IV is approximately 5%, indicating a significant need for new therapies that can prolong OS. 
 Advanced/metastatic NSCLC is a severe disease with a poor prognosis in the majority of patients. Treatment typically included a first-line combination chemotherapy followed by a choice of a second-line therapeutic approach. Most patients receiving first-line chemotherapy will progress within one year of treatment with a median PFS of approximately six to seven months and median OS of approximately 12 to 14 months. In the second-line setting, the median PFS for standard chemotherapy is approximately three to four months and median OS is approximately six to nine months. 
 However, even as the development of these immune checkpoint inhibitors represent a significant advance for NSCLC patients, most patients may still see their disease progress and the proportion of treated patients with low PD-L1 expression who respond to approved regimens is quite low (approximately 10%). We believe with these disease-progressing patients and low response rates, there is significant room to improve upon the benefit of PD-L1 inhibitors through combinations with drugs, like entinostat, that target immune modulation through complementary mechanisms. 
 There are other PD-L1 inhibitors being developed to treat NSCLC, such as Merck KGaA/Pfizer’s Bavencio, BeiGene, Ltd.’s BGB-A317, and Sanofi/Regeneron’s cemiplimab which are in Phase 3 trials. The clinical development programs for these PD-L1 inhibitors have been designed to understand the broad impact they could have across NSCLC, including chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients, as well as earlier stage patients. We anticipate the immune checkpoint inhibitors will be available for use across the spectrum of advanced NSCLC patients. 
 However, even as the development of these immune checkpoint inhibitors represent a significant advance for NSCLC patients, most patients may still see their disease progress and the proportion of treated patients with low PD-L1 expression who respond to approved regimens is quite low (approximately 10%). We believe with these disease-progressing patients and low response rates, there is significant room to improve upon the benefit of PD-L1 inhibitors through combinations with drugs, like entinostat, that target immune modulation through complementary mechanisms. 
 Melanoma 
 The incidence of malignant melanoma in most developed countries has risen faster than any other cancer type since the mid-1950s. In 2011, the average survival duration for patients with Stage IV melanoma, in which the melanoma has metastasized, was only six to ten months; and the five-year survival rate for such patients was 16%. Although this rate had not changed in some time, a recent major advance for melanoma came with the development and approval of drugs such as Zelboraf® (vemurafenib), Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) and Mekinist® (trametinib), for patients with a mutated BRAF gene, which is a human gene that encodes a protein called B Raf. 
 Melanoma is a particularly immune-responsive tumor, and thus, immunotherapy of melanoma has developed as a dynamic field for clinical research. To date, immunotherapies such as Yervoy® (ipilmumab), Keytruda and Opdivo® (nivolumab), have been approved for the treatment of malignant melanoma patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. However, in this tumor type as well, the immunotherapies represent a significant advance for only a small proportion of patients, leaving significant room to improve upon the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors through combinations with drugs, like entinostat, that target immune modulation through complementary mechanisms.

SNDX-6352 in GVHD
 GVHD is a condition that can develop after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, HSCT, whereby donated cells, graft, view the recipient’s, host’s, tissue as foreign and attack.  The chronic form of GVHD, cGVHD, can occur months or years after transplant and is the leading cause of late morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSCT. U.S. incidence of cGVHD is approximately 5,000 patients, or 30-70% of HSCT recipients. 
 cGVHD can affect many different organs or tissues, including skin, eyes, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract and neuromuscular system.  The first line of therapy for cGVHD is typically corticosteroids, though approximately 50% of patients may require treatment with additional systemic therapies, such as extracorporeal photopheresis, cytostatic agents such as mycophenolate moftetil, methotrexate, and immunmodulators such as rituximab, IL-2.  Imbruvica® (ibrutinib), a BTK inhibitor, is the only FDA-approved therapy for cGVHD and is indicated for use after one or more lines of therapy. Imbruvica received approval based on Phase 1/2 clinical trial data that showed a 68% overall response rate, with 48% of responses lasting 20 weeks or longer and reduced dependence on steroids for most patients.  Significant unmet need remains for these patients as no agent has demonstrated an improvement in long-term outcomes.
 SNDX-5613
 Rationale for Targeting MLLr
 MLLr leukemias arise by rare, spontaneous translocations at the MLL1 locus (11q23). It is estimated that approximately 10% of AML and ALL harbor this MLL-re-arrangement with a worldwide incidence of approximately 4,000 cases per year. These translocations generate oncogenic fusion proteins with more than 90 different MLL fusions currently known. All MLL fusion proteins bind with high affinity to the chromatin associated protein menin through a conserved N-terminal sequence. This specific interaction with menin enables an aberrant transcription program that drives leukemic transformation. In pre-clinical animal models, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated deep and durable single agent treatment effects in multiple leukemic xenografts harboring MLL fusions. Inhibiting the menin-MLL1 interaction represents a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of MLLr leukemias.
 Rationale for Targeting Nucleophosmin 1 Mutant AML
 NPM1 is among the most frequently mutated genes in AML, found in approximately 30% of AML cases for an incidence of approximately 20,000 cases per year.  Mutations in NPM1 lead to the aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the mutants, termed NPM1c. Loss of NPM1c from the nucleus leads to suppression of differentiation and enables a leukemic transcription program that relies critically on the menin-MLL1 complex to drive and maintain the program. As a result, NPM1c harboring cells are sensitive to menin-MLL interaction inhibitors.  In NPM1c cells, inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction suppresses the leukemic transcription program, causing growth arrest, terminal differentiation and cell death. In animal models, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated deep and durable single agent treatment effects in multiple NPM1c xenografts. Based on these findings, blocking the menin-MLL1 interaction represents a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of NPM1c AML.

Collaborations 
 Clinical Collaborations in Immuno-Oncology
 We have entered into several clinical collaborations in immuno-oncology, as we have further described below.  To the extent that any inventions arise from such a collaboration, each party will solely own inventions relating to its drug alone, and the parties will jointly own any inventions relating to the combination of the two drugs. In most cases, clinical data from the trial will be jointly owned.  In general, either party may terminate the applicable collaboration agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, either party may terminate the applicable agreement if it determines that the trial may unreasonably affect patient safety, or if a regulatory authority withdraws the approval to conduct a trial or takes an action that prevent such party from supplying its drug, or if the other party or its employees are sanctioned under certain healthcare-related laws, or if such party decides to discontinue development of its drug.
 Merck—MSD International GmbH 
 In March 2015, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck, under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Merck’s drug Keytruda in patients with NSCLC and melanoma. We are the sponsor of the clinical trial. Merck is supplying Keytruda for use in the clinical trial. Neither party will have any obligation to reimburse any costs incurred by the other party, except that a party may be required to reimburse the manufacturing costs of the other party upon certain early termination events. 
 Genentech 
 In August 2015, we entered into a combination study collaboration agreement with Genentech under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Genentech’s drug Tecentriq in patients with TNBC. We are the sponsor of the clinical trial. Genentech supplied Tecentriq for use in the clinical trial. Each party will perform its obligations under the agreement at its own expense, including its internal costs. In March 2019, we announced that this trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in PFS for the combination regimen versus Tecentriq monotherapy.
 In January 2018, we entered into a combination study collaboration agreement with Genentech under which Genentech will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Genentech’s drug Tecentriq in patients with HR+, HER2-, metastatic breast cancer. Genentech is the sponsor of the clinical trial. We are supplying entinostat for use in the clinical trial. Each party will perform its obligations under the agreement at its own expense, including its internal costs.
 Merck KGaA and Pfizer 
 In December 2015, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck KGaA and Pfizer under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with an investigational monoclonal antibody, Bavencio, in patients with ovarian cancer. Bavencio is being developed collaboratively by Merck KGaA and Pfizer, which are together treated as a single party for purposes of this agreement. We are the sponsor of the clinical trial. Merck KGaA and Pfizer supplied Bavencio for use in the clinical trial. In March 2019, we announced that this did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in PFS for the combination regimen compared with Bavencio monotherapy. 
 Nektar Therapeutics
 In May 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Nektar under which we agreed to conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Nektar’s proprietary IL2-based, CD122-biased agonist known as NKTR-214, in patients with metastatic melanoma. In January 2019, we agreed with Nektar not to advance the proposed clinical trial and the parties terminated the agreement. There were no costs associated with terminating the agreement.

NCI and Investigator Collaborations
Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI related to Entinostat 
 Our collaboration with the NCI is governed by a CRADA between us and the NCI. The CRADA was originally signed by Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Mitsui, and was then assigned to Schering AG following Schering AG’s acquisition of Mitsui. In 2007, Schering AG, then known as Bayer Schering Pharma AG), agreed to assign the CRADA to us in connection with the execution of a license, development and commercialization agreement, or the Bayer license agreement, with Bayer. 
 Under the CRADA, as amended, the NCI sponsors clinical studies on entinostat using researchers at the NCI as well as NCI-funded researchers at other institutions, including ECOG-ACRIN and JHU. In return, we receive access to the data generated in these clinical studies, and we are obligated to supply the clinical trial sites with sufficient quantities of entinostat. Additionally, we are required to make an annual payment to a particular NCI laboratory to help support certain research studies related to this and other clinical trial. We have no other payment obligations under the CRADA. 
 We own any intellectual property generated in the course of the collaboration with the NCI, or Collaboration IP, to the extent that Collaboration IP is generated by our employees. We also have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license under Collaboration IP generated by the NCI. With respect to any Collaboration IP that is owned by or licensed to us, we have agreed to grant the United States government a non-exclusive license to practice or have practiced this Collaboration IP throughout the world by or on behalf of the government for research or other government purposes. 
 Either party may terminate the CRADA either by mutual consent or unilaterally upon advance written notice to the other party. Absent such early termination, the CRADA will expire on May 21, 2019. As we have in the past, we expect to renew the CRADA at that time. 
 Clinical Trial Agreement with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
 In March 2014, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, a contracting entity for ECOG-ACRIN, which describes the parties’ obligations with respect to the NCI-sponsored pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of entinostat. Under the terms of the clinical trial agreement, ECOG-ACRIN is performing this clinical trial in accordance with the clinical trial protocol and a mutually agreed scope of work. In January 2015, we amended the agreement to provide for additional patient site reimbursement funds, which will be paid based on milestone-based payments. We will provide a fixed level of financial support for the clinical trial through an upfront payment of $0.7 million and a series of time- and milestone-based payments of up to $1.0 million each that are comprised of milestone payments through the completion of enrollment and time-based payments through the completion of patient monitoring post-enrollment. In addition, we are obligated to supply entinostat and placebo to ECOG-ACRIN for use in the clinical trial. From the second quarter of 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2018, we have entered into a number of amendments to the agreement to provide for additional study activities resulting in an increase of the contractual obligation of $5.1 million. We have agreed to provide this additional financial support to fund the additional activities required to ensure that the E2112 clinical trial will satisfy FDA registration requirements. As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate payment obligations under this agreement are approximately $24.5 million; and our remaining obligations under this agreement were $9.6 million over an estimated period of approximately three years.
 ECOG-ACRIN owns data and inventions from the Phase 3 clinical trial. We have access to the data generated in the clinical trial, both directly from ECOG-ACRIN under the clinical trial agreement, as well as from the NCI through our agreement with it. Additionally, ECOG-ACRIN has granted us a non-exclusive license to any inventions or discoveries that are derived from entinostat as a result of its use during the clinical trial, along with a first right to negotiate an exclusive license to any of these inventions or discoveries. 
 Either party may terminate the clinical trial agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or if the FDA or NCI withdraws the authorization to perform the clinical trial in the United States. The parties may jointly terminate the clinical trial agreement if the parties agree that safety-related issues support termination.

Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI related to Entinostat and SNDX-6352 
 In September 2016, we entered into a collaboration with the NCI related to both entinostat and SNDX-6352 is governed by a CRADA between us and the NCI. Under the CRADA, the NCI sponsors clinical studies on entinostat and SNDX-6352 using researchers at the NCI as well as NCI-funded researchers at other institutions. In return, we receive access to the data generated in these clinical studies, and we are obligated to supply the clinical trial sites with sufficient quantities of entinostat and SNDX-6352. Additionally, we are required to make an annual payment to a particular NCI laboratory to help support certain research studies related to this and other clinical trial. We have no other payment obligations under the CRADA. 
 We own all intellectual property generated during the collaboration with the NCI, or 6352 Collaboration IP, to the extent that 6352 Collaboration IP is generated by our employees. We also have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license under 6352 Collaboration IP generated by the NCI. With respect to any 6352 Collaboration IP that is owned by or licensed to us, we have agreed to grant the United States government a non-exclusive license to practice or have practiced this 6352 Collaboration IP throughout the world by or on behalf of the government for research or other government purposes. 
 License Agreement 
 Kyowa Hakko Kirin 
 In December 2014, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK, under which KHK received an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize entinostat in Japan and Korea. This license includes a sublicense under the rights we received under the Bayer license agreement. If we acquire or develop any other anti-cancer drug that, like entinostat, is a selective inhibitor of Class I HDAC, such drug will be included in this license as well. We will manufacture and supply entinostat to KHK during the term of the agreement, and such obligation may continue for a longer period if KHK continues to sell entinostat following expiration of the agreement or termination of the agreement for our breach. During the term of the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each party is prohibited from commercializing in the Japan and Korea any other selective inhibitor of Class I HDACs for the same indication as entinostat, with all forms of cancer being treated as the same indication. 
 We received an upfront license fee of $17.5 million, and KHK purchased 536,049 shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate price of approximately $7.5 million. We are eligible to receive up to $50.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $25.0 million in sales milestone payments. In October 2017, we announced that KHK dosed the first patient in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 2 trial of entinostat (designated KHK2375 by KHK), in combination with exemestane versus exemestane plus placebo in Japanese patients with advanced or recurrent HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Enrollment of the first patient in this trial triggered a $5 million milestone payment to us from KHK.
 KHK will pay us a transfer price for the supply of entinostat as well as royalties on net sales of entinostat above a specified threshold each calendar year by KHK, its affiliates and sublicensees in the low single digits. Royalty payment obligations will be payable in each country in the KHK territory until the later to occur of (i) the date that all valid claims of the last effective license patent in such country expires or is abandoned, withheld or otherwise invalidated and (ii) 15 years from the date of first commercial sale of entinostat in such country. Any payments owed to Bayer as a result of KHK’s development and commercialization of entinostat in the KHK territory will be made by us out of the payments we receive from KHK. 
 The agreement with KHK will expire with respect to each country in the KHK territory upon the expiration of all royalty payment obligations in such country. In addition, we may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice to KHK if KHK or any affiliate commences any action or proceeding that challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent in the KHK territory. KHK may terminate the agreement in its entirety for convenience at any time upon advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, or bankruptcy or related actions or proceedings. If we commit an uncured material breach of certain provisions of the agreement, KHK may, instead of terminating the agreement, elect to continue the agreement in full force and effect except certain payments to us will be reduced.

Sales and Marketing 
 We intend to create a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our product candidates in the United States. Our targeted sales force will focus on a well-defined group of medical oncologists, primarily in the non-hospital and academic settings, who are responsible for the care and treatment of cancer patients. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we would also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Outside the United States, we plan to rely on our current partners and may seek additional pharmaceutical partners for sales and marketing activities. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of entinostat, SNDX-6352 or SNDX-5613, and we do not have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. We also do not have any current contractual relationship for the manufacture of commercial supplies. If entinostat, SNDX-6352 or SNDX-5613 is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of such product. Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. 
Intellectual Property
 Patents and Property Rights 
 Through licensed intellectual property and our owned intellectual property, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as for other technologies, where appropriate. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad claiming our proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us or our licensors in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be granted to us or to our licensors in the future will protect our technology. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights. 
 Entinostat Patent Portfolio 
 We strive to protect entinostat with multiple layers of patents. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included one owned U.S. provisional patent applications jointly owned with The Regents of the University of Colorado, five owned pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, one owned allowed U.S. patent, five granted non-U.S. patents (including one Canadian patent jointly owned with The Regents of the University of Colorado), including a European Patent validated in seven countries, and 65 non-U.S. pending patent applications (including two pending international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT). Also, we have filed national phase applications in the Eurasia Regional Patent Office, Ukraine and Georgia based on our owned PCT application directed to treatment of selected breast cancer patients with a combination of entinostat and exemestane. We have assigned our rights to the application we filed in the Eurasia Regional Patent Office to Domain Russia Investments Limited, or DRI. We have also assigned our rights to the applications we filed in Ukraine and Georgia to NovaMedica LLC, or NovaMedica. We have also filed national phase applications based on 
 12


our owned PCT application directed to treatment of selected breast cancer patients with the combination of entinostat and exemestane in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the European Patent Office, or EPO, China, India, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico. Our owned entinostat patent portfolio includes pending U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat according to selected dosing regimens, methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat in combination with an HER2 inhibitor, methods of treating lung cancer patients by administration of entinostat in combination with an EGFR inhibitor, and treatments with entinostat combined with anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibodies. Our owned pending U.S. provisional and PCT applications relate to entinostat and CSF-1 or CSF-1R combination therapies and patient selection for combination therapy comprising entinostat and a second therapeutic agent, respectively. If issued, patents based on our owned pending U.S. applications and non-U.S. filings based on our owned PCT applications would expire between April 2029 and May 2039. 
 The patent portfolio we licensed from Bayer contains a number of issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as patent applications pending outside the United States. A number of the patents and patent applications we licensed from Bayer are directed to entinostat while other patents and patent applications are directed to compounds other than entinostat. As of December 31, 2018, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer included seven issued U.S. patents, 62 granted non-U.S. patents and 17 patent applications pending in non-U.S. patent offices. For example, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer includes reissue U.S. Patent RE39,754, which covers a genus of benzamide compounds including entinostat or SNDX-275. RE39,754 is a composition of matter patent having an initial term which expired in September 2017. 
 The portfolio we licensed from Bayer also includes U.S. Patent 7,973,166, or the ’166 patent, which covers a crystalline polymorph of entinostat which is referred to as crystalline polymorph B, the crystalline polymorph used in the clinical development of entinostat. Many compounds can exist in different crystalline forms. A compound which in the solid state may exhibit multiple different crystalline forms is called polymorphic, and each crystalline form of the same chemical compound is termed a polymorph. A new crystalline form of a compound may arise, for example, due to a change in the chemical process or the introduction of an impurity. Such new crystalline forms may be patented. By comparison, the U.S. Patent RE39,754, which expired in September 2017, covers the chemical entity of entinostat and any crystalline or non-crystalline form of entinostat. On March 7, 2014, our licensor Bayer applied for reissue of the ‘166 patent. The reissue application sought to add three additional inventors to the ‘166 patent. The reissue was granted as RE45,499 on April 28, 2015, at which time the original ‘166 patent was surrendered. The reissue patent has the same force and effect as the original ‘166 patent and the same August 2029 expiration date. 
 Of the 62 foreign-granted patents we licensed from Bayer, 26 are foreign counterparts of the ‘166 patent (now RE45,499) that cover crystalline polymorph B, the granted European patent comprises 37 national countries that all been validated, and the granted Eurasian patent comprises nine countries that have all been validated. Likewise, 15 of the 17 pending foreign applications are counterparts of the ‘166 crystalline polymorph B patent. Other patents and patent applications in the licensed Bayer portfolio cover methods of treatment by administration of entinostat. For example, U.S. Patent 7,317,028, which expired in October 2017, covers methods of treating selected cancers by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 7,687,525, which also expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating autoimmune disease by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 6,320,078, which expires in July 2019, covers methods of manufacturing entinostat; U.S. Patent No. 8,026,239, which expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating certain malignant tumors by administration of a compound within a subgenus of benzamide compounds including entinostat; U.S. Patent RE40,703, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat; and U.S. Patent 6,794,392, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat.

SNDX-6352 Patent Portfolio 
 We have also in-licensed from UCB a patent portfolio directed to SNDX-6352, an IND-ready anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. As of December 31, 2018, the SNDX-6352 composition-of-matter patent portfolio included one granted U.S. non-provisional patent application, two allowed non-U.S. applications, four granted non-U.S. patents and 33 non-U.S. pending patent applications. If issued, patents based on the in-licensed pending U.S. application and non-U.S. applications covering SNDX-6352 would expire in August 2034. Our in-licensed patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications directed to methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of fibrotic disease by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, and liquid pharmaceutical compositions of anti-CSF-1R antibodies. If issued, patents based on these pending applications would expire between November 2024 and February 2036. Further, the in-licensed portfolio includes three non-U.S. patents directed to methods of treating solid tumors by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity. The three patents will expire in October 2020. 
Menin Asset Patent Portfolio
 We have in-licensed from Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan, a patent portfolio directed to a series of selective preclinical inhibitors targeting the binding interaction of Menin with MLL-r.  As of December 31, 2018, the in-licensed portfolio included two pending U.S. applications and 29 non-U.S. pending patent applications (including pending PCT application) covering composition of matter and methods of treating, e.g., MLL. If issued, patents based on the in-licensed applications would expire between December 2036 and September 2037.
Patent Term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the earliest non-provisional application or PCT application. 
 In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The term of a patent that covers an approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and regulatory review process. To obtain a patent extension in the United States, the term of the relevant patent must not have expired before the extension application, the patent cannot have been extended previously under this law, an application for extension must be submitted, the product must be subject to regulatory review prior to its commercialization, and the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product after such regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. If our future products contain active ingredients which have not been previously approved, we may be eligible for a patent term extension in the United States. In the United States, we expect to seek extension of patent terms under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent for patent claims covering a new chemical entity. If patent extensions are available to us outside of the United States, we would expect to file for a patent term extension in applicable jurisdictions.

In-Licensed Intellectual Property 
 License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Bayer 
 In March 2007, we entered into the Bayer license agreement pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize entinostat and any other products containing the same active ingredient. The Bayer license agreement, as amended, permits us to use entinostat or other licensed products for the treatment of any human disease, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products for all commercially reasonable indications. Initially, Bayer manufactured and supplied our requirements of entinostat, but effective May 2012, manufacturing rights and responsibility for entinostat was transferred to us, by mutual agreement of the parties. 
 In connection with the execution of the Bayer license agreement, we paid Bayer an upfront license fee of $2.0 million. We are also obligated to pay up to approximately $50.0 million in the aggregate upon obtaining certain milestones in the development and marketing approval of entinostat, assuming that we pursue at least two different indications for entinostat or any other licensed product. 
 We are also obligated to pay Bayer up to $100.0 million in aggregate sales milestones, and a tiered single-digit royalty on net sales by us, our affiliates and sublicensees of entinostat and any other licensed products under the Bayer license agreement. We are obligated to pay Bayer these royalties on a country-by-country basis for the life of the relevant licensed patents covering such product or 15 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, whichever is longer. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Bayer would expire because no commercial sales of entinostat have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering entinostat in a given country may change in the future. 
 The Bayer license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations under the agreement in all countries. Upon expiration of the agreement our licenses become fully paid-up and irrevocable. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement in its entirety or with respect to certain countries in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement if voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings are instituted against the other party, if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or upon the occurrence of other specific events relating to the insolvency or dissolution of the other party. Bayer may terminate the Bayer license agreement if we seek to revoke or challenge the validity of any patent licensed to us by Bayer under the Bayer license agreement or if we procure or assist a third party to take any such action. 
 License Agreement with UCB 
 In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with UCB, or the UCB license agreement, under which UCB granted us a worldwide, sublicenseable, exclusive license to UCB6352, which the Company refers to as SNDX-6352, an IND-ready anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. The UCB license agreement permits us to use SNDX-6352 or other licensed products for all human uses, including treatment, prevention and diagnostic uses, in all indications, diseases, conditions or disorders, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize a certain licensed product. 
 In consideration for the license grant, we made a nonrefundable upfront payment of $5.0 million to UCB in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, subject to the achievement of certain milestone events, we may be required to pay UCB up to $119.5 million in one-time development and regulatory milestone payments over the term of the UCB license agreement. In the event that we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees commercializes SNDX-6352, we will also be obligated to pay UCB low double-digit royalties on sales, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as well as up to an aggregate of $250.0 million in potential one-time, sales-based milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to share a percentage of non-royalty income from sublicensees, subject to certain deductions, with UCB. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of SNDX-6352, except that UCB is performing a limited set of transitional chemistry, manufacturing and control tasks related to SNDX-6352. 
 15


Each party may terminate the UCB license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the UCB license agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to UCB. UCB may terminate the UCB license agreement if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the UCB license agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. 
 License Agreement with Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 In October 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan, or the Allergan License Agreement, under which Allergan granted us an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to, preclinical, orally-available, small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of Menin with the MLL protein, or the Menin Assets. We made a nonrefundable upfront payment of $5.0 million to Allergan in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, subject to the achievement of certain milestone events, we may be required to pay Allergan up to an aggregate of $99 million in one-time development and regulatory milestone payments over the term of the Allergan License Agreement. In the event that we or any of its affiliates or sublicensees commercializes the Menin Assets, we will also be obligated to pay Allergan low single to low double-digit royalties on sales, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as well as up to an aggregate of $70.0 million in potential one-time, sales-based milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to share a percentage of non-royalty income from sublicensees, subject to certain deductions, with Allergan. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the Menin Assets.
 Each party may terminate the Allergan License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the Allergan License Agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to Allergan. Allergan may terminate the Allergan License Agreement if we or any of its affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the Allergan License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. 
 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. 
 In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting and service agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed for us. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and related regulations. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon, among other things, the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion, and postmarket surveillance of drugs and biologics.

Biopharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceutical products may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for biologics;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the application for filing and review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of an NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biopharmaceutical product in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety, toxicity profile and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND must be submitted to the FDA, and the IND must become effective. A sponsor must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the submitted data or the conduct of the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND application must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and informed consent for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1—The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk ratio of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues. 
 The FDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in an NDA or BLA. An SPA agreement is not a guarantee of product approval by the FDA or approval of any permissible claims about the product. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement. In particular, the SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns later come to light, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, the IND sponsor fails to comply with the protocol agreed upon, or the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the IND sponsor when requesting an SPA agreement change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. 
 Some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include developed methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 FDA Review and Approval Processes 
 In order to obtain approval to market a biopharmaceutical product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. 
 The FDA will initially review an NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. After an NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 18


Upon the filing of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at 6 months, rather than the standard 10 months. Priority review is given for drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA or BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the product is approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the application will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study requirements. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of an NDA must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve an NDA without an approved REMS, if required. 
 Expedited Review Programs 
 Among other programs, the FDA may expedite the review of a product candidate designated as a breakthrough therapy, which is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a drug as a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND application for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may rescind a breakthrough therapy designation in the future if further clinical development later shows that the criteria for designation are no longer met. 
 Breakthrough therapy designation does not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or review process. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 If and when approved, any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences and submitting annual reports.
 19


Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports to have. The FDA and certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, fail to approve any application, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of an application, or we may recall the product from distribution. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures and injunctive action. 
 The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics. While doctors are free to prescribe any drug approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such products, and patients may decline to purchase them. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success. 
 In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies. Such pressure, along with the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union, will likely put additional downward pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions, governmental laws and regulations related to government healthcare programs, healthcare reform, and pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies. 
 20


The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement to the extent products for which we may receive regulatory approval are covered under a pharmacy benefit or are otherwise subject to a formulary. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The Affordable Care Act provides, and recent government cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers support, the view that federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may implicate the False Claims Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that perform certain services on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to: (i) payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals; and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or to adopt compliance programs as prescribed by state laws and regulations, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers, State laws that require manufactures to report pricing information regarding certain drugs, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information, which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may also be subject to federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of other personal information, including federal and state consumer protection laws, state data security laws, and data breach notification laws. A data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge, investigation or legal action under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 To the extent that any of our product candidates receive approval and are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, international data protection laws (including the General Data Protection Directive ((EU) 2016/679) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data as well as EU member state implementing legislation), and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our business, including, without limitation, our ability to commercialize, and the prices we may obtain for, any of our product candidates that are approved for sale, are the following: 

• | an annual, nondeductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of- sale discounts off negotiated prices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect such challenges to continue. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under its risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by the U.S. Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost-sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. The Trump administration also released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. While some of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain but may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products once commercialized. 
 23


Regulations Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 
Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
Employees 
 As of March 6, 2019, we had 38 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 24 were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 13 have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Corporate and Other Information 
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 2005. In 2011, we established a wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom and in 2014 we established a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary. There have been no material activities for these entities to date. We currently operate in one segment. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 35 Gatehouse Drive, Building D, Floor 3, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451 and our telephone number is (781) 419-1400. Our corporate website address is www.syndax.com. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not a part of this Annual Report, and the inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report is an inactive textual reference only. 
 We file electronically with the SEC, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We make available on our website at www.syndax.com, under “Investors,” free of charge, copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing these reports with the SEC.
