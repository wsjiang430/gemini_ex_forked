Item 1. Business
The Company
Meritage Homes is a leading designer and builder of single-family homes. We primarily build in historically high-growth regions of the United States and offer a variety of homes that are designed with a focus on first-time and first move-up buyers. We have homebuilding operations in three regions: West, Central and East, which are comprised of nine states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. These three regions are our principal homebuilding reporting segments. We also operate a wholly-owned title company, Carefree Title Agency, Inc. ("Carefree Title"). Carefree Title's core business includes title insurance and closing/settlement services we offer to our homebuyers. Managing our own title operations allows us greater control over the entire escrow and closing cycles in addition to generating additional revenue. Revenue and expense from Carefree Title are included in our Financial Services segment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Our homebuilding and marketing activities are conducted under the name of Meritage Homes in each of our homebuilding markets. In limited cases, we also offer luxury homes in some markets under the name of Monterey Homes. At December 31, 2018, we were actively selling homes in 272 communities, with base prices ranging from approximately $182,000 to $1,286,000. Our average sales price on closings and orders were approximately $407,000 and $401,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Available Information; Corporate Governance
Meritage Homes Corporation was incorporated in 1988 as a real estate investment trust in the State of Maryland. On December 31, 1996, through a merger, we acquired the homebuilding operations of our predecessor company. Since that time, we have engaged in homebuilding and related activities and ceased to operate as a real estate investment trust. Meritage Homes Corporation operates as a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Its homebuilding construction, development and sales activities are conducted through its subsidiaries.

Strategy
All facets of Meritage's operations are governed by our core values that define our culture and operational parameters, ensuring that our actions are aligned around our brand promise of delivering to each of our customers a LIFE. BUILT. BETTER.®
Our six core values include:
•Start With Heart
•Integrity Above All Else
•Develop to Empower
•Think Strategically
•Build Value, and
•Play to Win
These values combine our entrepreneurial spirit, cutting-edge innovation and organizational agility to strive for industry-leading results in all of our functional areas, including: management, land acquisition and development, finance, marketing, sales, purchasing, construction and customer care. The main tenets of these core values are:

• | Value, recognize and appreciate our employees, our trade partners and our customers; provide the highest level of customer service by bringing passion and care to every customer interaction and make a difference by giving back to the communities we serve;


• | Always act with honesty, character and integrity by demonstrating openness and transparency with our customers;


• | Strive to have the best team available through investing in our people and fostering an environment that embraces continual growth and learning;


• | Continuously and purposefully renew, rethink and innovate with the customer in mind by supporting and encouraging new ideas and recognizing efforts that grow shareholder value;


• | Be relentless in our pursuit of excellence and never settling by leading with action; and


• | Foster an environment of positive energy and alignment by collaborating and leveraging each other's strengths in order to win as a team and celebrate and reward success.

These core values are evident in the operational decisions we make in each of our divisions and communities, all of which contribute to the successes we have achieved with our customers, within the marketplace and within the homebuilding industry. 
Over the last couple of years we have made a strategic shift in our business, focusing on the growing demand for entry-level homes with our LiVE.NOW® communities targeted to the first-time buyer. Our LiVE.NOW® communities are designed to simplify and streamline our construction and sales processes to create a stress-free buying experience for our customers while also enabling our trade partners and suppliers to work more efficiently and cost effectively which allows us to pass these savings on to our customers. We have historically had a significant presence with move-up buyers and we recently began introducing a re-imagined design center experience intended to simplify the sale and design center processes in our move-up communities. We believe the changes we are making address the need for well-appointed yet lower-priced homes, given rising interest rates and home prices in today's environment. The end result is that of thinking strategically to simplify and maximize our business.
We continue to focus on innovation in every new home we build, employing industry-leading building techniques and technologies aimed at setting the standard for energy-efficient homebuilding. Accordingly, at a minimum, every new home we construct meets ENERGY STAR® standards, with many of our communities greatly surpassing those levels, offering our customers homes that utilize, on average, half of the energy of similarly sized standard US homes. Our commitment to incorporate these energy standards into all of our homes has resulted in our achievement of design, purchasing and production efficiencies that have allowed us to offer these as standard features to our home buyers for nominal additional cost while providing significant additional value. In addition, all the homes we build include home automation features through our M.Connected Home Automation Suite®. This technology includes features that allow homeowners to monitor and control key components of their homes, such as Wi-Fi enabled lighting, video doorbells and smart door locks. 
Year after year, the homes we design and build help deliver short- and long-term energy savings to our homeowners. As a result, for the sixth consecutive year, we have earned the EPA's highest ENERGY STAR award, "Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence". Because of our recognized industry leadership, utility companies and the US Department of Energy 
4

periodically partner with us to demonstrate scale advanced building technologies in the homes we build that further differentiate our product in the marketplace when compared against both new and resale homes.
We believe responsible corporate governance and social responsibility is important for the long-term sustainability of the business. We are committed to sustainability through the homes we build, the communities in which we live and work, and the ways we conduct ourselves every day. We provide information regarding these topics on our website and within publicly filed reports, including our Corporate Social Responsibility Report within the Investor Relations area of our website.

Recent Industry and Company Developments 
2018 was a year of growth and transition for the real estate and homebuilding industries, as they benefited during most of the year from strong underlying economic and housing market fundamentals evidenced by low unemployment levels, wage growth and a shortage in the supply of homes, particularly at entry-level price points. This strong demand waned in the later months of 2018 as rising interest rates and home prices caused buyers to delay their home purchasing decisions. With plentiful mortgage availability, improving economic metrics for most segments of the population, the meaningful re-entry of millennials into the home buying sector and downsizing needs of the baby boomer generation, we believe demand for new homes will be stable over the next decade and the largest population of buyers will be looking for smaller starter or move-down homes. Homebuilders with attractive, lower price-point product in desirable locations should be poised to capture this pent-up demand as millennial and move-down buyers look for nicely appointed but affordable homes. 
Over the last couple of years we have been executing a strategy to address the demand for more affordable homes by acquiring communities and designing homes that can be delivered at a lower cost by simplifying our product and our construction processes, starting more spec homes to allow buyers to move in quicker, and by enhancing and making the entire home buying experience easier for our customers. In line with historical trends in the homebuilding industry, the performance of individual housing markets continue to vary. Accordingly, we experienced healthy orders and average sales price growth in some markets and more tempered growth or declines in our year-over-year results in other markets. We remain focused on positioning ourselves in well-located and highly-desired communities in many of the top residential real-estate markets in the United States. We believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from our competition by offering a lineup of extremely livable and efficient plans featuring new designs that highlight the benefits of our industry-leading energy-efficient building features and home technology which we believe are particularly appealing to the first-time buyer. We believe the longer-term economic data supports a continuation in the homebuilding cycle although the next several quarters may be choppy as the market absorbs the psychological impact of higher home prices and increasing interest rates.

Higher closing volume contributed to another year of revenue growth in 2018, generating 9.0% higher home closing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. We also made progress on our strategic initiatives. Home closing gross margin improved by 60 basis points to 18.2% in 2018 compared to 17.6% in 2017 with notable improvements in our East Region. Our 2018 net earnings increased by 58.7% with a 63.6% increase in diluted EPS compared to prior year. We expanded the number of LiVE.NOW communities that target the first-time buyer, and a third of our communities at December 31, 2018 and over 40% of our 2018 orders represented our entry-level product. 
We carefully manage our liquidity and balance sheet, particularly during times of limited economic visibility. During 2018, we increased the capacity of our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") to $780.0 million, extended the maturity date of the Credit Facility to July 2022, and issued $200.0 million in 6.00% senior notes due 2025 (the "Additional Notes"). The Additional Notes were issued as an add-on to the existing $200.0 million of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2025 that were issued in June 2015 which resulted in a combined $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2025 outstanding at December 31, 2018. The net proceeds from the Additional Notes were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, which included borrowings used for the redemption of the Company's 4.50% Senior Notes that were due to mature on March 1, 2018. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $311.5 million as compared to $170.7 million at December 31, 2017. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 43.2% and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 36.7% at December 31, 2018, compared to 44.9% and 41.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. We maintained a consistent lot supply with 34,553 lots under control at December 31, 2018 versus 34,319 in 2017 but we spent $209.2 million less on land and land development in 2018 than we did in 2017, due to negotiated land purchase terms and less expensive lots to supply our entry-level business.
In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, authorizing the expenditure of up to $100.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. Prior to December 31, 2018, we repurchased the entire $100.0 million allowed under the program at an average price of $38.71 per share, retiring 2.6 million shares of our common stock.
Land Acquisition and Development
Our current land pipeline goal is to maintain an approximate four-to-five year supply of lots, which we believe provides an appropriate planning horizon to address regulatory matters, perform land development and manage to our business plan for future closings. To grow our business and to better leverage our existing overhead, we are currently focused on adding to our current lot positions and expanding our market share in our existing markets and their surrounding submarkets while also exploring opportunities outside of our existing markets, when available. As of December 31, 2018 we have a 4.1-year supply of lots, based on 2018 closings. We continually evaluate our markets, monitoring and adjusting our lot supplies through lot and land acquisitions to ensure we have a sufficient pipeline that is in sync with local market dynamics as well as our goals for growth in those markets. Approximately 85.0% of the 2018 newly controlled lots are designated for entry-level communities.
We are currently purchasing primarily partially-developed or undeveloped lots as the opportunity to purchase substantially finished lots in desired locations is more limited. Finished lots are those on which the development has already been completed by a third party, and which are ready for immediate home construction. Undeveloped land and partially finished lots require a longer lead time to allow for development activities before our new communities are able to open for sales. Typically, undeveloped and partially finished lots are purchased at a lower cost than finished lots as we are responsible for improvements on the land, rather than paying a mark-up on improvements from a prior developer. When evaluating any land acquisition, our selection is based upon a variety of factors, including:

• | financial feasibility of the proposed project, including projected profit margins, return on capital invested, and the capital payback period;


• | suitability of the land to achieve desired shift in product mix toward entry-level and first move-up product;


• | management’s judgment as to the local real estate market and economic trends, and our experience in particular markets;


• | existing concentration of owned and contracted lots in surrounding markets, including nearby Meritage communities;


• | timeline for development, generally within a three to five-year time period from the beginning of the development process to the delivery of the last home;


• | surrounding demographics based on extensive marketing studies, including surveys of both new and resale homebuyers;


• | the ability to secure governmental approvals and entitlements, if required;


• | results of environmental and legal due diligence;


• | proximity to schools and to local traffic and employment corridors and amenities;


• | entitlement and development risks and timelines; and


• | availability of seller-provided purchase options or agreements that allow us to defer lot purchases until needed for production.

When purchasing undeveloped or partially developed land, we strive to defer the closing for the land until after most necessary entitlements have been obtained to eliminate or minimize risk and so that development or construction may begin as market conditions dictate. The term “entitlements” refers to appropriate zoning, development agreements and preliminary or tentative maps or plats, depending on the jurisdiction within which the land is located. Entitlements generally give the developer the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with conditions that are ordinarily within the developer’s control. Even though entitlements are usually obtained before land is purchased, we are typically still required to secure a variety of other governmental approvals and permits prior to and during development, and the process of obtaining such approvals and permits can be lengthy. We may consider the purchase of unentitled property when we can do so in a manner consistent with our business strategy. Currently, we are purchasing and developing parcels that on average range from 100 to 200 lots.
Once we secure undeveloped land, we generally supervise and control the development of the land through contractual agreements with subcontractors. These activities include site planning and engineering, as well as constructing road, sewer, water, utilities, drainage, landscaping improvements, and recreation amenities and other improvements and refinements. We may build homes in master-planned communities with home sites that are along or near major amenities, such as golf courses or recreation facilities.
The factors used to evaluate finished lot purchases are similar to those for land we intend to develop ourselves, although the development risks associated with the undeveloped land—financial, environmental, legal and governmental—have been borne by others. Therefore, these finished lots may be more attractive to us, despite their higher price, as we can immediately bring the community to market and begin home construction as well as mitigate potential cost and time risks that can occur during the land development cycle.
We develop a design and marketing plan tailored to each community, which includes the determination of type, size, style and price range of homes. We may also determine street layout, individual lot size and layout, and overall community design for each project we develop. The homes offered depend upon many factors, including the guidelines, if any, of the existing community, housing available in the area, the needs and desired housing product for a particular market, and our lot sizes, though we are increasingly able to use standardized design plans across most of our communities.
As a means of accessing parcels of land with minimal cash outlay, we may use rolling option contracts. Acquiring our land through option contracts, when available, allows us to leverage our balance sheet by controlling the timing and volume of lot and land purchases from third parties. These contracts provide us the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy lots and are usually structured to approximate our projected absorption rate at the time the contract is negotiated. Lot option contracts are generally non-recourse and typically require the payment of non-refundable deposits of 5% to 20% of the total land purchase price. The use of option contracts limits the market risks associated with land ownership by allowing us to re-negotiate option terms or terminate options in the event of market downturns. In the event we elect to cancel an option contract, our losses are typically limited to the forfeiture of our option deposits and any associated capitalized pre-acquisition costs. The cost of obtaining land through such option contracts is generally higher than if we were to purchase land in bulk, although the financial leverage they can provide can outweigh the financing costs associated with them. However, during a period of gross margin contraction, we diligently analyze each option contract to ensure financial feasibility and will generally only contract for lots in this manner if we are still able to achieve desired margins. During 2018 we were successful in securing approximately 2,400 lots through such options. Land purchases are generally financed through our working capital, including corporate borrowings.
At December 31, 2018, in addition to our 24,009 owned lots, we also had 10,544 lots under purchase or option contracts with a total purchase price of approximately $533.2 million secured by $47.4 million in cash deposits. We purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding operations, although we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders from time to time where we have excess land positions or for other strategic reasons. Information related to lots and land under option is presented in Note 3—Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Real Estate Not Owned in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
All land and lot acquisitions are reviewed by our corporate land acquisition committee, which is comprised of certain members of our executive management team and key operating executives. All land acquisitions exceeding a specified dollar amount must also be approved by our Board of Directors' Land Committee.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities — Joint Ventures
We may enter into joint ventures as a means of accessing larger parcels of land, expanding our market opportunities, managing our risk profile and leveraging our capital base. While purchasing land through a joint venture can be beneficial, we currently do not view joint ventures as critical to the success of our homebuilding operations. We currently have only three such active ventures. In addition to land development joint ventures, we also participate in one mortgage business joint venture. The mortgage joint venture is engaged in mortgage activities, primarily providing services to our customers.
In connection with our land development joint ventures, we may also provide certain types of guarantees to associated lenders and municipalities. 
Construction Operations
We typically act as the general contractor for our projects and hire experienced subcontractors on a geographic basis to complete construction at fixed prices. We usually enter into agreements with subcontractors and materials suppliers on an individual basis after receiving competitive bids. In certain markets at high risk for cost increases, we enter into fixed-fee bids when it makes economic sense to do so. We also enter into longer-term and national or regional contracts with subcontractors and suppliers, where possible, to obtain more favorable terms, minimize construction costs and to control product consistency and availability. Our contracts require that our subcontractors comply with all laws and labor practices pertaining to their work, follow local building codes and permits, and meet performance, warranty and insurance requirements. Our purchasing and construction managers coordinate and monitor the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, and monitor compliance with zoning, building and safety codes. At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 765 full-time construction and warranty employees.
We specify that quality durable materials be used in the construction of our homes and we do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in process materials for homes under construction. When possible, we negotiate price and volume discounts and rebates with manufacturers and suppliers on behalf of our subcontractors so we can take advantage of production volume. Our raw materials consist primarily of lumber, concrete, drywall, roofing materials and similar construction materials and are frequently purchased on a national or regional level. Such materials have historically been available from multiple suppliers and therefore we do not believe there is a supplier risk concentration. However, because such materials are substantially comprised of natural resource commodities, their cost and availability is subject to national and worldwide price fluctuations and inflation, each of which could be impacted by legislation or regulation relating to energy, climate change or tariffs.
We generally build and sell homes in phases within our larger projects, which we believe creates efficiencies in land development, home construction operations and cash management. We also believe it improves customer satisfaction by reducing the number of vacant lots and construction activity surrounding completed homes. Our homes are typically completed within three to five months from the start of construction, depending upon the geographic location and the size and complexity of the home. Construction schedules may vary depending on the size of the home, availability of labor, materials and supplies, product type, location, municipal requirements and weather. Our homes are usually designed to promote efficient use of space and materials, and to minimize construction costs and time. We typically do not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge against weather or materials fluctuations as we do not believe they are particularly advantageous to our operations, although we do lock in short and mid-term pricing with our vendors for certain key construction commodities.
Marketing and Sales 
We believe that we have an established reputation for building a diversified line of attractive, high quality and efficient homes, which helps generate demand in our communities. Our communication and marketing plans are tailored to target and reach our different customer segments. Part of these plans involve reaching new customers through a combination of advertising and other promotional activities targeting key consumer segments through online advertising, online listings, social media, email, articles and posts to drive consumers to our website at www.meritagehomes.com. In addition, our local marketing efforts are focused to drive consumers to visit specific communities in the market via incremental online promotions, direct mail, grass roots marketing campaigns and events, and to a more limited extent magazine, newspaper or radio advertisements, as well as strategically placed signs in the vicinities near our communities. Our marketing strategy is aimed at differentiating Meritage from resale homes, as well as new homes offered by other homebuilders. We solidify this differentiation across all of our marketing and sales efforts to explain how we have thoughtfully selected and incorporated every home's energy-efficient features and benefits as part of a larger, integrated system that enables us to deliver on our LIFE. BUILT. BETTER.® brand promise to our customers, which means having a home that is quieter, cleaner, healthier, smarter and safer.
We sell our homes using furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate to prospective homebuyers the advantages of the designs and features of our homes. At December 31, 2018, we owned 356 completed model homes, 42 models under construction and leased back an additional 8 model homes. We generally employ or contract with interior and 
8

landscape designers who enhance the appeal of our model homes, which highlight the features and options available for the product line within a project. We typically build between one and three model homes for each actively selling community, depending upon the products to be offered and the number of homes to be built in the project. We strive to implement marketing strategies that will educate our buyers on how our unique building techniques and the energy efficient and home automation features in our homes differentiate them from other homes. In our communities, we have built "learning centers" and in-home displays in order to inform our buyers about our many energy-efficient and home automation features and help them understand how and to what extent a Meritage home can help them realize savings through reduced energy bills, and experience and enjoy better health, improved comfort and peace of mind. For our move-up buyers, we recently began introducing a completely re-imagined design center experience. We believe buyers prioritize quality, personal expression and beautiful design along with savings and efficient timelines when choosing their home. With the introduction of our new design center experience, we believe we will deliver this experience to our buyers.
Our homes generally are sold by our commissioned sales associate employees who work from a sales office typically located in a converted garage of one of the model homes for each community. We also employ a team of online sales associates who offer assistance to potential buyers viewing our communities and products online. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 500 full-time sales and marketing personnel. Our goal is to ensure that our sales force has extensive knowledge of our housing product, our energy efficient and innovative features, our sales strategies, mortgage options, and community dynamics, in order to fully execute our marketing message. To achieve this goal, we train our sales associates and conduct regular meetings to update them on our product, communities, sales techniques, competition in the area, financing availability, construction schedules, marketing and advertising plans, available product lines, pricing, options and warranties offered, as well as the numerous benefits and savings our energy efficient product provides. Our sales associates are licensed real estate agents where required by law. We may offer various sales incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades, to attract buyers. The use, type and amount of incentives depends largely on economic and local competitive market conditions. Third-party brokers may also sell our homes, and are usually paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. Frequently, third-party brokers bring prospective buyers to our communities. We have a robust loyalty program for these brokers and we aim to regularly educate them on the benefits of owning a Meritage home and our community offerings, which we believe helps enhance the impact of our marketing message.
We differentiate ourselves from our competitors with our highly desirable and affordable community and plan offerings and our simplified home buying process to effectively meet the needs of today's homebuyers. We also differentiate ourselves through the superior design and value of our communities and homes, our energy-efficiency and other technologies, and our offerings and enhancements made pursuant to the results of ongoing surveying and product research efforts. We believe our commitment to design and build energy-efficient homes is aligned with buyer sensitivities about how eco-friendly designs, features and materials help impact the environment and the livability of homes, as well as their pocketbooks. As evidenced in our strategic shift to focus primarily on first-time and first move-up buyers through our LiVE.NOW. and Design Collections offerings, we are committed to continually evaluating buyer preferences and making adjustments to the homes we offer and the targeted price points in accordance with buyer demand. We believe these efforts set us apart from both other new homes available for sale and the re-sale home market.
Backlog
Our sales contracts require cash deposits and may be subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer’s ability to qualify for financing. Homes covered by such sales contracts but which are not yet closed are considered “backlog” and are representative of potential future revenues. Started homes are excluded from backlog until a sales contract is signed and are referred to as unsold or “spec” inventory. A contract contingent upon the sale of a customer’s existing home is not considered a sale and not included in backlog until the contingency is removed. All of our entry-level homes are started as spec homes whereas a signed sales contract is generally required to release a lot to start construction of a move-up home, although on a regular basis we also start a certain number of move-up homes for speculative sales inventory. We may also start construction on spec homes to accelerate or facilitate the close-out of a community. As a result of our strategic shift to expand our entry-level home product offerings and communities and increase the availability of quick move-in home opportunities, our spec inventory increased to 9.2 specs per active community as of December 31, 2018 as compared to 8.5 in 2017. At December 31, 2018, 78.8% of our 2,433 homes in backlog were under construction. 
We do not recognize any revenue from a home sale until a finished home is delivered to the homebuyer, payment is collected and other criteria for sale and profit recognition are met. At December 31, 2018, of our total unsold homes in inventory excluding completed model homes, 68.7% were under construction without sales contracts and 31.3% were completed homes without sales contracts. A portion of the unsold homes resulted from homesites that began construction with valid sales contracts that were subsequently canceled. We believe that during 2019 we will deliver to customers substantially all homes in backlog at December 31, 2018 under existing or, in the case of cancellations, replacement sales contracts.
9

The number of units in backlog decreased 15.4% to 2,433 units at December 31, 2018 from 2,875 units at December 31, 2017 with a corresponding decrease in the value of backlog to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. 
Customer Financing
Most of our homebuyers require financing. Accordingly, we refer them to mortgage lenders that offer a variety of financing options. While our homebuyers may obtain financing from any mortgage provider of their choice, we have a joint venture arrangement with an established mortgage broker that allows it to act as a preferred mortgage broker to our buyers in most of our markets to help facilitate the financing process as well as generate additional revenue for us through our interest in the joint venture (See Note 4 for additional information on joint venture financial results). In some markets, we may also have referral relationships with unaffiliated preferred mortgage lenders. We may pay a portion of the closing costs to assist homebuyers who obtain financing from our preferred lenders. 
Customer Relations, Quality Control and Warranty Programs
We believe that positive customer relations and an adherence to stringent quality control standards are fundamental to our continued success, and that our commitment to buyer satisfaction and quality control has significantly contributed to our reputation as a high-quality builder.
In accordance with our company-wide standards, one or more Meritage project manager or superintendent generally monitors compliance with quality control standards for each community through the building phase of our homes. These employees perform the following tasks:

• | oversee home construction;


• | monitor subcontractor and supplier performance;


• | manage scheduling and construction completion deadlines; and


• | conduct formal inspections as specific stages of construction are completed.

At the time a home is completed and delivered to a buyer, the customer relationship is transitioned to a customer relations employee who manages the warranty and customer care efforts.    
We generally provide a one-to two-year limited warranty on workmanship and building materials and a ten-year warranty for the structural integrity of the homes we build. We require our subcontractors to provide evidence of insurance before beginning work and provide a warranty to us and to indemnify us from defects with their work and therefore any claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the subcontractors’ responsibility. In certain markets and for certain attached product, we offer an owner-controlled insurance program to our subcontractors which, if accepted, is the insurance for damage resulting from construction defects in lieu of some of the insurance we require from the subcontractor. Although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects (and for those operating in markets with our owner-controlled insurance program, pay a deductible as a condition to such coverage), we are, during applicable warranty periods, ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs. Accordingly, with the assistance of an actuary, we have estimated and established reserves for future structural warranty costs based on the number of home closings and historical data trends for warranty work within our communities. Warranty reserves generally range between 0.1% to 0.6% of a home’s sale price. Those projections are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural warranty claims relating to the construction of our homes, the markets in which we build, claim settlement history, and insurance and legal interpretations, among other factors and we are, therefore, constantly monitoring such reserves. Historically, these reserves have been sufficient to cover net out-of-pocket warranty costs.
Competition and Market Factors
The construction and sale of homes is a highly-competitive industry. We compete for sales in each of our markets with national, regional and local developers and homebuilders, as well as existing resale homes, condominiums and rental housing. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and may have lower costs than we do. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, product type, amenities, design, innovation, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate due to our:

• | ability to recognize and adapt to changing market conditions, from both a capital and human resource perspective;


• | streamlined construction processes that allow us to save on materials, labor and time and pass those savings to our customers in the form of lower prices;


• | experience within our geographic markets which allows us to develop and offer products that provide superior design and quality in line with the needs and desires of the targeted demographic;

10


• | ENERGY STAR® standards in all of our communities and incremental energy-efficient features that create a variety of benefits to our customers and differentiate our product from competing new and existing home inventories;


• | inclusion of home automation through our new M.Connected Home Automation Suite®;


• | ability to capitalize on opportunities to acquire land on favorable terms; and


• | reputation for outstanding service and quality products and our exceptional customer and warranty service.

Our product offerings and strategic locations are successfully competing with both existing homes inventory and surrounding new-home communities as evidenced by our relative orders volume and market share in most of our divisions. We expect that the strengths noted above will continue to provide us with long-term competitive advantages.
We have an extensive market research department that assists the operating divisions in each of our markets to better compete with other homebuilders and the inventory of re-sale homes in surrounding neighborhoods. Our strategic operations team conducts in-depth community-level reviews in each of our markets, including a detailed analysis of existing inventory, pricing, buyer demographics and the identification of each location’s key buyer metrics. This analysis and resulting analytical tools assist in decision-making regarding product designs, positioning, and pricing and underwriting standards for land purchases and land development. Additionally, our market research department is focused on evaluating and identifying new market opportunities. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
To the extent that we acquire undeveloped land, we prefer to close the acquisition of such land after all or most entitlements have been obtained. Construction may begin almost immediately on such entitled land upon compliance with and receipt of specified permits, approvals and other conditions, which generally are within our control. The time needed to obtain such approvals and permits affects the carrying costs of unimproved property acquired for development and construction. The continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in government policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretation and application. The government approval processes discussed above have caused some timing delays but have not had a material adverse effect on our development activities, although there is no assurance that these and other restrictions will not adversely affect future operations as, among other things, sunset clauses may exist on some of our entitlements and they could lapse.
Local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions. These fees are normally established when maps or plats are recorded and building permits obtained. Governing agencies may also require concessions or may require the builder to construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets. In addition, governing agencies may impose construction moratoriums. Because most of our land is entitled, construction moratoriums typically would not affect us in the near term unless they arise from health, safety or welfare issues, such as insufficient water, electric or sewage facilities. We could become subject to delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums, “no growth” or “slow growth” initiatives or building permit allocation ordinances, which could be implemented in the future.
In addition, there is constantly a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. Some of this legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase the cost to construct homes, although our energy-efficiency technologies and offerings meet, and in many instances exceed, current and expected energy efficiency thresholds. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and may result in increased costs and longer approval and development timelines. Similarly, energy and environment-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world, and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, such initiatives could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive carbon dioxide emissions control and other environmental and energy-related regulations.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. In some markets, we are subject to environmentally sensitive land ordinances that mandate open space areas with public elements in housing developments, and prevent development on hillsides, wetlands and other protected areas. We must also comply with open space restrictions, flood plain restrictions, desert wash area restrictions, native plant regulations, endangered species acts and view restrictions. These and similar laws and regulations may result in delays, cause substantial compliance and other costs, and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. To date, compliance with such laws and regulations has not materially affected our operations, although it may do so in the future.

We condition our obligation to acquire property on, among other things, an environmental review of the land. To date, we have not incurred any material unanticipated liabilities relating to the removal or remediation of unknown toxic wastes or other environmental conditions. However, there is no assurance that we will not incur material liabilities in the future relating to toxic waste removal or other environmental conditions affecting land currently or previously owned.
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed or USDA-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state.
Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.
Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,615 full-time employees, including 310 in management and administration, 40 in our title company, 500 in sales and marketing, and 765 in construction and warranty operations. Our operations are carried out through both local and centralized management. Local operations are made up of our division employees, led by management with significant homebuilding experience and who typically possess a depth of knowledge in their particular markets. Our centralized management sets our strategy and leads decisions related to the Company's land acquisition, risk management, finance, cash management and information systems. Our employees are not unionized, and we believe that we have good employee relationships. We pay for a substantial portion of our employees’ insurance costs, with the balance contributed by the employees. We also have a 401(k) savings plan, which is available to all employees who meet the plan’s participation requirements.
We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are coordinated by our project managers and field superintendents who schedule and monitor third party independent subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for architectural, engineering, advertising and some legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically sell more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which creates additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy the deliveries in the second half of the year. We typically benefit from the cash generated from home closings more in the third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long term, although it has been and may continue to be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
