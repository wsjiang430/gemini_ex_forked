Item 1.  Business
 
Las Vegas Xpress, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, originally formed as a Utah corporation under the name State Cycle, Inc. on August 7, 1974. We moved the corporation to the state of Nevada and changed our name to X Rail Enterprises, Inc. on November 5, 2015, at which time our primary business changed from mining to rail transportation, passenger excursions, rail car construction and rail related operations and services. Effective November 4, 2017, we changed our name to Las Vegas Xpress, Inc.
 
Company Overview
 
Las Vegas Xpress, Inc. is in the specialty passenger train business and has three operating or in planning stage divisions, The X Train, which will be an excursion railroad between metropolitan areas and resort/casino destinations, X Wine Railroads, which is a rail excursion from metropolitan areas to wine regions, and Club X Train, a riders membership club for X Train customers.
 
As used in this filing, references to "the Company," "LVXI", "we", "our," "ours" and "us" refer to Las Vegas Xpress, Inc., and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.
 
X Train
 
The X Train will be an excursion passenger rail service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. We expect service to begin in early 2020. LVXI plans to have its casino guests ride the exclusive train service and to manage the host activity of its guests throughout their stay in the resort/casino. We anticipate that, in addition to the service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, future X Train runs will be added in the coming years.
 
We expect to operate the X Train as an Amtrak train listed on the Amtrak national timetable. Amtrak will provide the locomotives, crew and railcars for the project. X Train will provide a complete bundled package of services including ticket, rooms and transfers to & from the station and weekend events such as access to nightclubs, golf outings and restaurants. It will be scheduled as a Friday through Sunday service with passengers in Los Angeles boarding the train at Union Station and arriving at the station in downtown Las Vegas and leased and operated by the X Train. Only the X Train will be able to use our station in Las Vegas. A typical X Train will carry 11 passenger cars and will include food service and will carry on average, 700 passengers per trip. This number can be increased by adding more cars to the route.
 
Our LA to Vegas business plan emanates from a regional transportation feasibility study published in 2007, which suggested that a well-run rail service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas could garner up to 30% of the approximately 12 million passengers who regularly drive between these two metropolitan areas. See: www.rtcsouthernnevada.com. We believe that with our current business plan, we would be able to break-even, on an operating basis, with approximately 20,000 riders per year.
 
To commence commercial service of the Los Angeles to Las Vegas route, we will need to negotiate and secure the necessary rights, equipment and facilities by August 2019. These items include: securing a regularly scheduled train agreement from Amtrak to operate our excursion service on a weekly basis beginning with one round trip train per week and increasing to six round trips per week over the next several years as demand dictates, securing operating rights to run our trains over tracks owned by private railroads, obtaining the capability to operate train equipment safely and in conformity with applicable government regulations, and purchasing or leasing appropriate locomotive and passenger cars designed to move passengers over the route in comfort and securing leases on terminal facilities and passenger depots in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas. We expect the X Train to begin running in January 2020.  We will operate as a railroad under Amtrak’s national entitlement common carrier status.

X Wine Railroad
 
The Company’s X Wine Railroad service from LA Union Station to Santa Barbara California runs on a scheduled basis, once a month on Saturdays, with individual riders (retail) as well as charters for corporate outings and special events (corporate). The X Wine Railroad provides a unique wine tasting experience to riders who take the train aboard special period classic railcars and an excursion to the Los Olivos wine area of Southern California. Over 250 private wineries reside in the area and the X Wine Railroad provides private access to these vineyards on an exclusive basis. Ticket prices are $369 per person, all inclusive. Since February 2017 this train has run once and the Company expects to continue to run this train intermittently, depending on demand. X Wine provides an all-inclusive day trip including a gourmet breakfast, wine tasting in the wineries, wine and cheese lunch at the wineries, and a gourmet dinner on the train's return trip.
Club X Train
 
Club X Train, which is still in the planning stage, will be a one stop shop for all Las Vegas rooms, activities, tours, show tickets and packages. Las Vegas shows, hotel rooms, tours, nightclubs and attractions will all available for members of ClubXTrain.com. This will be the only site riders need to plan their Vegas vacation getaway.
 
We anticipate that when a customer purchases a train ticket on either the X Train (once it commences operations) or any of the X Wine Railroad excursions, such tickets will include enrollment in our Club X membership club. Members will receive points from each excursion they ride and will be provided discounts on products and services we provide. The more they ride, the more points they will receive. Club X train will be the customer's ticket within Vegas for access to nightclubs, hosted bottle service, pool parties, gentlemen's clubs and the Club X Train Crawl: a high end to visiting three nightclubs in one night. Customers will outline their desired plan for the evening and Club X Train will take care of arranging all the details.  We expect to commence offering Club X Train service when the X Train commences running, currently anticipated to be January 2020.

Plan of Operations
 
The X Train
 
On February 11, 2016, the Company entered into share exchange agreements with some shareholders of Las Vegas Railway Express, Inc. ("Las Vegas Rail"). Las Vegas Rail had developed a brand identity in its development of a passenger train service from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, called the X Train. Las Vegas Xpress, Inc. was formed to enter into an agreement with selected shareholders of Las Vegas Rail to exchange the stock of the Company for certain shares of Las Vegas Rail. In addition, the Company executed a license agreement with XTRN to pay a royalty of 5% of the gross revenues generated by the Company's operation of the X Train brand services including the operating name of Las Vegas Railway Express. Accordingly the Company owns the right to use Las Vegas Railway Express and the X Train brand and logo, which it acquired under the license agreement.
 
Under the licensing agreement Las Vegas Xpress, Inc. operates an excursion passenger rail service also known as the X Train that will run between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Service is expected to begin in 2020. The Company plans to have its casino guests ride this exclusive train service and manage a host of activities for its guests throughout their stay in the resorts and casinos in Las Vegas.
 
Accordingly, the Company plans to operate an excursion passenger rail service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The service will operate as an Amtrak train on the Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF railroad and Metrolink railroad under Amtrak's access entitlement. The X Train will be stored in Amtrak's 8th Street yard in Los Angeles and the consist will be assembled there by Amtrak switching engines. Each consist will be made up eleven Amtrak passenger railcars deployed specifically for this service. Each railcar will be retrofitted with a Las Vegas motif. Each train will consist of 11 railcars with a total capacity of approximately 444 passengers.
 
Arrival into Las Vegas is planned to be at the train station in downtown Las Vegas at the Plaza Hotel.
 
At arrival, passengers will disembark the rail cars and immediately board a limo or tour bus provided by Greyhound under an agreement with them to take them to the property where they are staying. All accommodations and activities planned for the weekend stay will be booked via the X Train booking center in Las Vegas, Club X. Weekend VIP and club hop services will be coordinated through our Club X service (www.clubxtrain.com)  for niteclub and outings. Passengers will be picked up at their hotels on Sunday at noon for a 2 pm departure back to Los Angeles Union Station where the weekend experience is concluded.

 Our Competitive Strengths

We have developed a business model that focuses on leisure travelers between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  We believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain a competitive advantage in the market we serve:
 
Large Untapped Market of 12 Million Drivers.  There has been no regular passenger rail service between the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas for over 20 years. The only major highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas is Interstate 15 (“I-15”). Of the more than 12,000,000 annual visitors from the Southern California/Los Angeles market, 94% use automobile transportation to Las Vegas via this corridor every year. We only need to capture 28,000 of these drivers (approximately 0.025 % of the total marketplace) to meet our plan on an operating basis.  As the LA population grows, so will the traffic on this highway; the forecast for traffic on I-15 is expected to be 17 million passengers by 2030. Congestion on I-15 is increasing, with motor vehicle travelers experiencing substantial delays during peak travel times (e.g., generally over 6 hours of drive time on Friday and Sunday afternoons). With increasing gasoline costs, increasingly restrictive highway capacity, and reduced air travel from LA to Las Vegas, a rail transportation product - with both First Class and Coach – should be an attractive and viable alternative. Our trains will offer a service that will set us apart from other travel options by extending our customers’ “Las Vegas” experience while en route.

“Las Vegas Style” Service. The focus of our approach is to create a unique, Vegas class, “must see” mode of travel that not only serves the functional purpose of transporting passengers to Las Vegas, but also integrates seamlessly into the traditional and iconic Las Vegas experience. To accomplish this goal, our award winning team of design professionals and staff has assembled an on-board product reflective of the “Las Vegas” theme, which is comprised of a comfortable, fun, upscale and provocative atmosphere with multiple on-board amenities. Each train ticket entitles a passenger to an assigned seat with a high-quality meal and an alcoholic beverage.
 Oversize baggage, access to the on-board Wi-Fi network, and other premium options will also be available for additional ancillary fees. Commissions will be derived through our call centers, our website, and our on-board mobile application, where customers will be presented with the option to book ahead for various Vegas attractions and necessities such as hotels, shows, tours, restaurant reservations, and rental cars.
 Experienced Management and Board of Directors.  We have a strong management team and board of directors comprised of both experienced industry professionals and successful entrepreneurs. Our CEO, Michael Barron has been a successful entrepreneur establishing and growing several companies over the past 30 years. Our board of directors is led by Dr. Harry Teng, Head of the School of Rail Engineering at UNLV in Las Vegas, Lou Schillinger, CEO of Short Line Insurance Company, with over 300 industry rail clients insured and Don Adams, a 50 year icon in the Las Vegas hotel/casino scene. Company management has operated passenger service on a railroad with our own Club X cars and staff.
