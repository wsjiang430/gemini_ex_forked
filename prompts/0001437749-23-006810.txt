Item 1.         Business
General
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation in 1997. We are a diversified provider of truck components, oil and gas pipeline components and aerospace and defense electronics. We produce a wide range of manufactured products, often under multi-year, sole-source contracts.
 
We focus on those markets where we believe we have the expertise, qualifications and leadership position to sustain a competitive advantage. We target our resources to support the needs of industry participants that embrace technological innovation and flexibility, coupled with multi-year contractual relationships, as a strategic component of their supply chain management. These contracts, many of which are sole-source by part number, have historically created opportunities to invest in leading-edge processes or technologies to help our customers remain competitive. The productivity and innovation that can result from such investments helps to differentiate us from our competition when it comes to cost, quality, reliability and customer service.
 
Our manufacturing processes frequently involve the fabrication or assembly of a product or subassembly according to specifications provided by our customers. We strive to enhance our manufacturing capabilities by advanced quality and manufacturing techniques, lean manufacturing, just-in-time procurement and continuous flow manufacturing, six sigma, total quality management, stringent and real-time engineering change control routines and total cycle time reduction techniques. At the same time, we are working to develop new designs and product innovations by re-engineering traditional solutions to eliminate cost without reducing durability or quality.
 
Business Division Summary
 
We are organized into two business segments, Sypris Technologies and Sypris Electronics. Sypris Technologies, which is comprised of Sypris Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries, generates revenue primarily from the sale of forged, machined, welded and heat-treated steel components primarily for the heavy commercial vehicle and high-pressure energy pipeline applications. Sypris Electronics, which is comprised of Sypris Electronics, LLC, generates revenue primarily through circuit card and full “box build” manufacturing, high reliability manufacturing, systems assembly and integration, design for manufacturability and design to specification work.
Sypris Technologies. Through Sypris Technologies, we are a significant supplier of forged and machined components, serving the commercial vehicle, off highway vehicle, recreational vehicle, automotive, industrial and energy markets in North America. We have the capacity to produce drive train components including axle shafts, transmission shafts, gear sets, steer axle knuckles, and other components for ultimate use by the leading automotive, truck and recreational vehicle manufacturers, including General Motors Company (GM), Freightliner LLC (Freightliner), Mack Truck (Mack), Navistar International Corporation (Navistar), PACCAR, Inc. (PACCAR), Volvo Truck Corporation (Volvo) and Bombradier Recreational Products (BRP). We support our customers’ strategies to outsource non-core operations by supplying additional components and providing additional value added operations for drive train assemblies. We also manufacture high-pressure closures and other fabricated products for oil and gas pipelines.
 
Our manufacturing contracts for the truck components and assemblies markets are often sole-source by part number. Part numbers may be specified for inclusion in a single model or a range of models. Where we are the sole-source provider by part number, we are generally the exclusive provider to our customer of those specific parts for the duration of the manufacturing contract.
 
Sypris Technologies also manufactures energy-related products such as pressurized closures, insulated joints and other specialty products, primarily for oil and gas pipelines and related energy markets. These products are an important source of diversified revenues, which has become an area of greater focus for the Company. We are committed to exploring new product developments and potential new markets for our energy-related products, which will also be an increasing area of focus for the Company going forward.
 
Sypris Technologies represented approximately 63% of our net revenues in 2022.

Sypris Electronics. Sypris Electronics generates revenue primarily through circuit card and full box build manufacturing, high reliability manufacturing, systems assembly and integration, design for manufacturability and design to specification, for customers in the aerospace and defense electronics markets. This includes circuit card assemblies for electronic sensors and systems including radar systems, tactical ground stations, navigation systems, weapons systems, targeting and warning systems and those used in the nation’s high priority space programs.
 
We provide our customers with a broad variety of value added solutions, from low-volume prototype assembly to high-volume turnkey manufacturing. Our manufacturing contracts for the aerospace and defense electronics market are generally sole-source by part number. Our customers include large aerospace and defense companies such as Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop Grumman), Lockheed Martin (Lockheed), L3Harris Technologies (L3Harris), Raytheon Technologies including Collins Aerospace Systems (Raytheon), BAE Systems (BAE) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI). We serve as a subcontractor on U.S. government programs and do not serve as a prime contractor to the U.S. government.
 
The engineering and manufacturing of highly complex components for the aerospace and defense industries is a fragmented industry with no dominant player in the market. The industry has continued to grow with more companies developing printed circuit board assembly capabilities and others entering the market via mergers and acquisitions of smaller companies. This competitive business environment, along with the impact of federal government spending uncertainties in the U.S. and the allocation of funds by the U.S. Department of Defense has challenged Sypris Electronics over the past several years.
 
During 2021 and 2022, we announced new program awards for Sypris Electronics, with certain programs continuing into 2024. In addition to contract awards from Department of Defense (“DoD”) prime contractors related to weapons systems, electronic warfare and infrared countermeasures in our traditional aerospace and defense markets, we have also been awarded subcontracts related to the communication and navigation markets, which align with our advanced capabilities for delivering products for complex, high cost of failure platforms.
 
On March 28, 2022, President Biden's Administration submitted to Congress the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget request, which proposed $813.4 billion in total national defense spending, of which $773 billion was for the base budget of the DoD.
 
On December 29, 2022, the President signed the FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act into law, which provides $858 billion in total national defense funding, of which $816.7 billion is for the DoD base budget. This reflects a $44.6 billion increase over the FY 2023 request for national defense spending, and a $43.7 billion increase for the DoD.
 
The FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act also provided separate and additional funding of $47 billion for Ukraine, the fourth supplemental since March of 2022, bringing the total amount of supplemental funding authority provided to $113 billion.
 
The President’s FY 2024 budget request is anticipated to be submitted to Congress in March 2023, initiating the FY 2024 defense authorization and appropriations legislative process. In addition to the FY 2024 budget process, Congress will have to contend with the legal limit on U.S. debt, commonly known as the debt ceiling. The current statutory limit of $31.4 trillion was reached in January 2023, requiring the Treasury Department to take accounting measures to continue normally financing U.S. government obligations while avoiding exceeding the debt ceiling. It is expected, however, the U.S. government will exhaust these measures by June 2023. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. government may not be able to fulfill its funding obligations and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary programs and wider financial and economic repercussions. The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable congressional debate. Although we believe DoD, intelligence, and homeland security programs will continue to receive consensus support for increased funding and would likely receive priority if this scenario came to fruition, the effect on individual programs or our results cannot be predicted at this time.
 
We expect to compete for follow-on business opportunities as a subcontractor on future builds of several existing government programs. However, the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable uncertainty and the impact on demand for our products and services and our business are difficult to predict.

During 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges and increased demand caused global electronic component shortages, extended lead times and pricing escalations. This had a negative impact on our production schedules and margin performance in 2022 for Sypris Electronics. The majority of the government aerospace and defense programs that we support require specific components that are sole-sourced to specific suppliers; therefore, the resolution of supplier constraints requires coordination with our customers or the end-users of the products. We have partnered with our customers to qualify alternative components or suppliers and will continue to focus on our supply chain to attempt to mitigate the impact of supply component shortages on our business. We expect that global delays of raw materials will impact overall component availability in 2023. We may not be successful in addressing these shortages and other issues.
 
Sypris Electronics accounted for approximately 37% of net revenue in 2022.
 
Our Markets
 
Sypris Technologies. The industrial manufacturing markets of this segment include automotive, truck and off-highway components and assemblies and specialty closures. The automotive, truck and off-highway components and assemblies market consists of the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, including FCA, Freightliner, GM, Mack, Navistar, PACCAR and Volvo, and an extensive supply chain of companies of all types and sizes that are classified into different levels or tiers. Tier 1 companies represent the primary suppliers to the OEMs and include Meritor, Detroit Diesel Corporation (Detroit Diesel), American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (America Axle) and Transmisiones y Equipos Mecanicos, S.A. de C.V. (Tremec), among others. Below this group of companies reside numerous suppliers that either supply the OEMs directly or supply the Tier I companies. In all segments of the truck components and assemblies market, however, suppliers are under intense competitive pressure to improve product quality and to reduce capital expenditures, production costs and inventory levels. The customers for our specialty closure products consists primarily of operators and builders of oil and gas pipelines, which are also facing significant pressures to improve quality, reduce costs and defer capital expenditures.
Sypris Electronics. Although we believe that our programs are well aligned with national defense and other priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending and tax policy, changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities, the affordability of our products, changes in or preferences for new or different technologies, general economic conditions, tariffs and other factors may affect the level of funding for existing or proposed programs.
 
Market conditions for our electronic manufacturing business are characterized by a number of factors. The nature of providing manufactured products to the aerospace and defense electronics industry as well as other regulated markets differs substantially from the commercial electronics manufacturing industry. The cost of failure can be significant, the manufacturing requirements are typically complex and products are produced in relatively small quantities. Companies within this industry are required to maintain and adhere to a number of strict and comprehensive certifications, security clearances and traceability standards.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to improve our position in each of our core markets by increasing the number of multi-year relationships with customers and investing in highly innovative and efficient production capacity to remain competitive on a global scale. We intend to serve our customers and achieve this objective by continuing to:
 
Concentrate on our Core Markets. We are a significant supplier of forged, machined, welded and heat-treated components and subassemblies, serving the commercial vehicle, off highway vehicle, light truck and energy markets in North America. We have been an established supplier to major aerospace and defense companies and agencies of the U.S. Government for over 40 years. We will continue to focus on those markets where we have the expertise, capacity and qualifications to achieve a competitive advantage.
 
Dedicate our Resources to Support Strategic Partnerships. We will continue to prioritize our resources to support the needs of industry leaders that embrace multi-year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management and have the potential for long-term growth. We prefer contracts that are sole-source by part number so we can work closely with the customer to the mutual benefit of both parties.
Pursue the Strategic Acquisition of Assets. Over the long-term, we may consider the strategic acquisition of assets to consolidate our position in our core markets, expand our presence outside the U.S., create or strengthen our relationships with leading companies and expand our range of products in return for multi-year supply agreements. We will consider assets that can be integrated with our core businesses and that can be used to support other customers, thereby improving asset utilization and achieving greater productivity, flexibility and economies of scale.

Grow Through the Addition of New Value-Added Manufacturing Capabilities. We hope to grow through the addition of new value-added manufacturing capabilities and the introduction of additional components in the supply chain that enable us to provide a more complete solution by improving quality and reducing product cost, inventory levels and cycle times for our customers. In many instances, we offer a variety of state-of-the-art machining capabilities to our customers in the industrial manufacturing markets that enable us to reduce labor and shipping costs and minimize cycle times for our customers over the long-term, which we believe will provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.
 
We believe that the number and duration of our strategic customer relationships should grow to enable us to invest in our business with greater certainty and with less risk. The investments we make in support of these relationships are targeted to provide us with the productivity, flexibility, technological edge and economies of scale that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition in the future when it comes to cost, quality, reliability and customer service.
 
Customer Concentration
 
Our five largest customers in 2022 were Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico, S.A de C.V. (Sistemas), Detroit Diesel, Northrop Grumman, ADI and SubCom, LLC (SubCom), which in the aggregate accounted for 70% of net revenue. Our five largest customers in 2021 were Sistemas, Detroit Diesel, Northrop Grumman, ADI and Tremec, which in the aggregate accounted for 68% of net revenue. In 2022, Sistemas, Detroit Diesel and Northrop Grumman, represented approximately 22%, 18% and 14% of our net revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in 2022. In 2021, Sistemas, Detroit Diesel and Northrop Grumman, represented approximately 21%, 18% and 16% of our net revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in 2021.
Geographic Areas and Currency Fluctuations
 
Our operations are located in the U.S. and Mexico. Our Mexican subsidiary is a part of Sypris Technologies and manufacture and sell a number of products similar to those Sypris Technologies produces or previously produced in the U.S. In addition to normal business risks, operations outside the U.S. may be subject to a greater risk of changing political, economic and social environments, changing governmental laws and regulations, currency revaluations and market fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have primarily impacted our earnings only to the extent of remeasurement gains or losses related to U.S. dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiary, because the vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. For each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, “other expense, net” included foreign currency translation losses of less than $0.1 million.
 
Net revenues from our Mexican operations were $51.2 million, or 47%, and $45.4 million, or 47%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, net income from our Mexican operations was $2.2 million, as compared to our consolidated net loss of $2.5 million. In 2021, net income from our Mexican operations was $2.5 million, as compared to our consolidated net income of $2.9 million. You can find more information about our regional operating results, including our export sales, in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Sales and Business Development
 
Our principal sources of new business originate from the expansion of existing relationships, referrals and direct sales through senior management, direct sales personnel, domestic and international sales representatives, distributors and market specialists. We supplement these selling efforts with a variety of sales literature, advertising in trade media and participating in trade shows. We also utilize engineering specialists to facilitate the sales process by working with potential customers to reduce the cost of the products they need. Our specialists achieve this objective by working with the customer to improve their product’s design for ease of manufacturing or by reducing the amount of set-up time or material that may be required to produce the product. The award of contracts or programs can be a lengthy process, which in some circumstances can extend well beyond 24 months. Upon occasion, we commit resources to potential contracts or programs that we ultimately do not win.
 
Our objective is to increase the value we provide to the customer on an annual basis beyond the contractual terms that may be contained in a supply agreement. To achieve this objective, we commit to the customer that we will continuously look for ways to reduce the cost, improve the quality, reduce the cycle time and improve the life span of the products we supply the customer. Our ability to deliver on this commitment over time is expected to have a significant impact on customer satisfaction, loyalty and follow‑on business.

We have signed long-term supply agreements with Detroit Diesel, Volvo, Tremec and Sistemas. We have launched the Sypris Ultra® axle shaft with Detroit Diesel and have strong interest from others within the customer base who are interested in this patented product. We are continuing to explore other opportunities as they arise and have a significant number of outstanding quotations in progress, but there can be no assurances that our efforts to develop new sources of revenues will be successful.
 
Competition
 
The markets that we serve are highly competitive, and we compete against numerous domestic and international companies in addition to the internal capabilities of some of our customers. In the industrial manufacturing markets, we compete primarily against other component suppliers such as Ramkrishna Forgings Limited, Mid-West Forge, Inc., GNA Axles Limited, Brunner International, Inc., Bharat Forge, Commercial Forged Products, Spencer Forge and Machine, Inc., Traxle, SPX Flow, Inc., T.D. Williamson Inc. and National Oilwell Varco, Inc., certain of which serve as suppliers to many Tier I and smaller companies. In the aerospace and defense electronics market, we compete primarily against other component suppliers such as Celestica Inc., Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Spartronics. We may face new competitors in the future as the outsourcing industry evolves and existing or start-up companies develop capabilities similar to ours. In addition, we will face new competitors as we attempt to increase and expand our business.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the availability of capacity, currency exchange rates (especially in low-cost countries), technological capability, flexibility, financial strength and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, and the price, quality and delivery requirements of our customers. Although we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, some of our competitors, as compared to us, are larger and have greater financial and operating resources, greater geographic breadth and range of products, customer bases and brand recognition than we do. We also face competition from manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers that continually evaluate the relative benefits of internal manufacturing compared to outsourcing.
 
Suppliers
 
For portions of our business, we purchase raw materials and component parts from our customers or from suppliers chosen by our customers, at prices negotiated by our customers. When these suppliers increase their prices, cause delays in production schedules or fail to meet our customers’ quality standards, these customers have typically agreed to reimburse us for the costs associated with such price increases and not to charge us for costs caused by such delays or quality issues. Accordingly, our risks are largely limited to accurate inspections of such materials, timely communications and the collection of such reimbursements or charges, along with any additional costs incurred by us due to delays in, interruptions of, or non-optimal scheduling of production schedules. However, for a meaningful part of our business, we arrange our own suppliers and assume the additional risks of price increases, quality concerns and production delays.
 
Raw steel and fabricated steel parts are a major component of our cost of sales and net revenue for the industrial manufacturing business. We purchase a portion of our steel for use in this business at the direction of our customers, with periodic changes in the price of steel being reflected in the prices we are paid for our products. Increases in the costs of steel or other supplies can increase our working capital requirements, scrap expenses and borrowing costs.
 
The Company has encountered a greater number of electronic component shortages and extended lead time issues due to shortages of certain components in the marketplace for the Sypris Electronics business. These shortages and extended lead times are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This may result in increased prices, extension of our product delivery dates, and increased inventory levels for these components as we secure the necessary components from our suppliers or alternative suppliers.
 
There can be no assurance that supply interruptions, tariffs or price increases will not slow production, delay shipments to our customers or increase costs in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Delays, interruptions or non-optimal scheduling of production related to disruptions in raw materials supplies can be expected to increase our costs.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We own or license a number of patents and trademarks, but our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one patent, trademark, license or technologically related group of patents or licenses.
 
   5

  

We regard our manufacturing processes and certain designs as proprietary trade secrets and confidential information. We rely largely upon a combination of trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers and consultants, and our internal security systems, confidentiality procedures and employee confidentiality agreements to maintain the trade secrecy of our designs and manufacturing processes.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities, in the U.S. and Mexico, including regulations concerning financial reporting and controls, labor relations, minimum pension funding levels, export and import matters, health and safety matters and protection of the environment. While compliance with applicable regulations has not adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance in the future or that these regulations will not change or that the costs of compliance will not be material to us.
 
We must comply with detailed government procurement and contracting regulations and with U.S. Government security regulations, certain of which carry substantial penalty provisions for nonperformance or misrepresentation in the course of negotiations. Our failure to comply with our government procurement, contracting or security obligations could result in penalties or our suspension or debarment from government contracting, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
 
We are required to maintain U.S. Government security clearances in connection with certain activities of Sypris Electronics. These clearances could be suspended or revoked if we were found not to be in compliance with applicable security regulations. Any such revocation or suspension would delay our delivery of products to customers. Although we have adopted policies designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that the approved status of our facilities or personnel will continue without interruption.
 
We are also subject to comprehensive and changing federal, state and local environmental requirements, both in the U.S. and in Mexico, including those governing discharges to air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We use hazardous substances in our operations and, as is the case with manufacturers in general, if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from any properties that we may own or operate, we may be held liable and may be required to pay the cost of remedying the condition. The amount of any resulting liability could be material.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 719 employees, of which 538 were engaged in manufacturing, 11 were engaged in sales and marketing, 52 were engaged in engineering and 118 were engaged in administration. Approximately 415 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions that expire on various dates through 2025. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers. Although we believe overall that relations with our labor unions are positive, there can be no assurance that present and future issues with our unions will be resolved favorably, that negotiations will be successful or that we will not experience a work stoppage, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
 
Throughout our Company’s history, we always recognized that people drive the strength of our business and our ability to effectively serve our clients and sustain our competitive position. We are focused on harmonizing our approach to talent to provide seamless opportunities and better experiences to our employees.
 
We have a Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) applicable to all of our employees, our officers and directors and others (such as contractors) performing services for the Company. The Code of Conduct creates expectations and provides guidance on how to carry out our activities in accordance with our purpose, values and ethics, as well in compliance with applicable laws and Company policies. Our Code of Conduct includes topics such as anti-corruption, conflict of interest, discrimination, environmental responsibility, harassment, privacy, political activities, appropriate use of Company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. It is used to reinforce our passion for operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner. The Code of Conduct also emphasizes the importance of having an open, welcoming environment in which all employees feel empowered to do what is right and are encouraged to voice concerns should violations of the Code of Conduct be observed. All employees are required to complete training on the Code of Conduct annually.
 
In an effort to ensure business continuity of our operations during events where senior leadership personnel is impacted, we endeavor each year to examine the top roles within our corporate and subsidiary organizations and identify individuals who could step into those positions if called upon to do so and to identify a set of individuals who could do so with additional time, experience and development.  This succession planning exercise is conducted annually and reviewed with the Board of Directors.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to keep our employees safe and to maintain operations, we sought to comply with government orders in all the states and countries where we operate and in some instances required and enforced stricter protocols than were required by the governing authorities to minimize the risks to our employees. The health and wellness of our employees are critical to our success.
