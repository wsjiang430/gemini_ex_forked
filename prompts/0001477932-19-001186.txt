ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
The Company is a Texas corporation which, prior to 1998, was engaged in the specialty packaging business, primarily as a supplier of packaging products to the agricultural industry. During 1997, the Company commenced an orderly liquidation of its assets (described below) which was completed in 1997. At present, management of the Company is seeking to secure a suitable merger partner wishing to go public or to acquire private companies to create investment value for the Company. For purposes of Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Company is considered a shell company.
History
 
Prior Business Operations
 
The Company was established in July of 1993 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dawson Geophysical Company (“Dawson” and formerly known TGC Industries, Inc.). On July 30, 1993, the Company purchased certain assets of Union Camp Corporation’s packaging division for a purchase price of approximately $6.14 million. The assets purchased included substantially all of the business of weaving and constructing Saxolin Ò paper mesh and polypropylene plastic mesh bagging material for agricultural and industrial applications and substantially all of the properties related to Union Camp’s packaging division. The properties acquired by Chase consisted of Union Camp’s plant facilities located in Portland, Oregon, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, and all machinery, equipment, and inventories connected with these facilities.
 
The Company experienced losses from 1994 through 1997, and in 1997 the Company’s secured lender decided not to renew the Company’s operating line of credit. The Company’s Board of Directors therefore determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and all of its creditors to liquidate in an orderly fashion.
 
Effective July 21, 1997, the Company sold its operations at Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Lockwood Packing Corporation (“Lockwood”). The assets sold included substantially all of the Company’s equipment, furniture, fixtures, and other assets located in the Idaho Falls, Idaho, facility for a total of $75,000. In addition, the Company sold inventory from the Idaho Falls operation to Lockwood for $255,000. The proceeds from these sales were used to reduce the Company’s loan balance with its lender.
 
On July 25, 1997, the Company notified its creditors by mail that the Company would begin an orderly liquidation of all of its remaining assets, outside of a formal bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, in a manner intended to maximize the asset values. The Company retained the firm of Edward Hostmann, Inc. to assist the Company in such liquidation which was completed during 1997.
 
Post-Liquidation Operations
 
Since 1999, the Board of Directors has devoted its efforts to establishing a new business or engaging in a merger or other reorganization transaction.

The Company closed a private placement of 13,334 units (the “Units”) on September 7, 2007. Each Unit was sold for $150 and consisted of: one share of Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock ($100 stated value) convertible into 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “common stock”); 500 shares of common stock; and 500 five-year warrants, each warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at $0.15 per share. Gross proceeds from the offering were $2,000,100, expenses of the offering were approximately $38,000, and net proceeds were approximately $1,962,000.
 
The Company is reporting that effective on December 31, 2018, the Company successfully completed a voluntary early conversion of its outstanding Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock. As a result, the Company no longer has any of the Preferred Stock outstanding.
 
The board of directors authorized the Company to offer to the preferred stock holders the opportunity to convert the preferred stock to common stock at the rate of $0.085, a 15% discount from the $0.10 stated conversion price. Each preferred stock holder accepted the offer, and 36,589 shares of preferred stock were converted to 43,045,897 shares of common stock, effective on December 31, 2018. The board of directors believes that this more simplified capital structure makes the Company a more attractive merger candidate, although there can be no assurances that any such transaction will be available or will occur or, if it were to be approved by the board of directors, that the stockholders of the Company would vote in favor of the transaction.
