Item 1.    BUSINESS
General
Founded in 1938 in Portland, Oregon, as a small, family-owned, regional hat distributor and incorporated in 1961, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown to become a global leader in designing, sourcing, marketing, and distributing outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "we," "us," "our," "the Company," and "Columbia" refer to Columbia Sportswear Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest.
As one of the largest outdoor and active lifestyle apparel and footwear companies in the world, our products have earned an international reputation for innovation, quality and performance. We design, source, market, and distribute outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment under four primary brands, which complement each other to address the diverse needs of consumers:
Columbia®
The Columbia brand is our largest brand, offering performance and casual products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. The durability and functionality of our Columbia brand products make them ideal for a wide range of outdoor and active lifestyle activities, serving a broad population of consumers, including skiers, snowboarders, mountain climbers, outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, hunting and fishing enthusiasts, endurance trail runners, golfers, and outdoor-inspired consumers.
SOREL®
Acquired in 2000, our SOREL brand offers premium, durable and design-driven footwear products to a market of fashion forward and brand savvy female consumers. The SOREL brand also offers a collection of premium men’s and youth utility footwear.
Mountain Hard Wear®
Acquired in 2003, the Mountain Hardwear brand, headquartered in Richmond, California, offers premium apparel, accessories and equipment primarily for the high performance needs of mountaineering enthusiasts and other outdoor athletes, as well as for consumers who are inspired by the outdoor lifestyle.
prAna®
Acquired in 2014, the prAna brand, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, offers stylish and versatile active lifestyle apparel and accessories designed and manufactured with an emphasis on sustainable materials and processes. Our prAna brand apparel products focus on consumers whose active lifestyles include activities such as rock climbing, yoga, outdoor watersports, hiking, and adventure travel. 
Other Brands
The OutDry® brand, acquired in 2010, holds various patents pertaining to processes for manufacturing waterproof and breathable apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. We have incorporated OutDry technology in certain of our branded products.
The Pacific Trail® brand, acquired in 2006, is licensed to third parties across a range of apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. 
We distribute our products through a mix of wholesale distribution channels, our own direct-to-consumer ("DTC") channels (retail stores and e-commerce), independent international distributors, and licensees. In 2018, our products were sold in approximately 90 countries. Substantially all of our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers located outside the United States.
Consumer desire for our products is affected by many variables, including the popularity of outdoor activities and active lifestyles, changing design trends, consumer adoption of innovative performance technologies, variations in seasonal weather, and the availability and desirability of competitor alternatives. Therefore, we seek to drive, anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by developing new products with innovative performance features and designs, creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to generate consumer awareness, demand and retention, and adjusting the mix and price points of available product offerings. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.
Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described below in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
2

Seasonality and Variability of Business
Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry, including seasonal weather and discretionary consumer shopping and spending patterns. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our sales are weighted substantially toward the third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year. In 2018, approximately 60% of our net sales and approximately 80% of our operating income were realized in the second half of the year, illustrating our dependence upon sales results in the second half of the year, as well as the less seasonal nature of our operating costs. The expansion of our DTC businesses has increased the proportion of sales, profits and cash flows that we generate in the second half of the year.
Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period, particularly in light of disruptions in wholesale businesses of distribution, seasonal weather, changes in consumer purchasing behavior, persistent volatility in global economic and geopolitical conditions, volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, and inflationary or volatile input costs, each of which reduces the predictability of our business.
For further discussion regarding the effects of the macro-economic environment on our business, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report. 
Products
We develop and manage our merchandise in two principal categories: (1) apparel, accessories and equipment and (2) footwear. The following table presents the Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and percentages of net sales attributable to each of our principal product categories, for each of the last three years ended December 31:

(Dollars in millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
Net Sales | | % of Sales | | Net Sales | | % of Sales | | Net Sales | | % of Sales
Apparel, accessories and equipment | $ | 2,191.0 | | | 78.2 | % | | $ | 1,928.0 | | 78.2 | % | $ | 1,865.4 | 78.5 | %
Footwear | 611.3 | | | 21.8 | | | 538.1 | | | 21.8 | | 511.6 | | 21.5 
Total | $ | 2,802.3 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 2,466.1 | | 100.0 | % | $ | 2,377.0 | 100.0 | %

Apparel, accessories and equipment
We design, develop, market, and distribute apparel, accessories and equipment for men and women under our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear, SOREL, and prAna brands, and for youth under our Columbia brand. Our products incorporate the cumulative design, fabrication, fit, and construction technologies that we have pioneered over several decades and that we continue to innovate. Our apparel, accessories and equipment are designed to be used during a wide variety of outdoor activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, hiking, climbing, mountaineering, camping, hunting, fishing, trail running, water sports, yoga, golf, and adventure travel.
Footwear
We design, develop, market, and distribute footwear products for men, women and youth under our Columbia and SOREL brands. Our footwear products include durable, lightweight hiking boots, trail running shoes, rugged cold weather boots for activities on snow and ice, sandals and shoes for use in water activities, and casual shoes for everyday use. Our Columbia brand footwear products seek to address the needs of both the casual consumer and outdoor consumers who participate in activities that typically involve challenging or unusual terrain and trail conditions, in a variety of weather. Our SOREL brand products offer premium casual and cold weather footwear for all ages and genders, with a focus on young, fashion-conscious female consumers.
Product Design and Innovation
We are committed to designing innovative and functional products for consumers who participate in a wide range of outdoor activities, enabling them to enjoy those activities longer and in greater comfort by keeping them warm or cool, dry and protected. We also place significant value on product design and fit (the overall appearance and image of our products) that, along with technical performance features, distinguish our products in the marketplace.
Our research and development efforts are led by an internal team of specialists who work closely with independent suppliers to conceive, develop and commercialize innovative technologies and products that provide the unique performance benefits desired by consumers during outdoor activities. We have also established working relationships with specialists in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, industrial design, materials research, and graphic design, and in other related fields. We utilize these relationships, along with consumer insights and feedback, to develop and test innovative performance products, processes, packaging, and displays. We believe that these efforts, coupled with our technical innovation efforts, represent key factors in the past and future success of our products.

Intellectual Property
We own many trademarks, including Columbia Sportswear Company®, Columbia®, SOREL®, Mountain Hard Wear®, prAna®, OutDry®, Pacific Trail®, the Columbia diamond shaped logo, the Mountain Hardwear nut logo, the SOREL polar bear logo, and the prAna sitting pose logo, as well as many other trademarks relating to our brands, products, styles, and technologies. We believe that our trademarks are an important factor in creating a market for our products, in identifying our Company and in differentiating our products from competitors' products. We have design and utility patents, which expire at various times, as well as pending patent applications in the United States and other countries. We file applications for United States and foreign patents for inventions, designs and improvements that we believe have commercial value; however, these patents may or may not ultimately be issued, enforceable or used in our business. The technologies, processes and designs described in our patents are incorporated into many of our most important products. We believe our success primarily depends on our ability to continue offering innovative solutions to match consumer needs through design, research, development, and production advancements, rather than our ability to secure patents. We vigorously protect these proprietary rights against counterfeit reproductions and other infringing activities. Additionally, we license some of our trademarks across a range of apparel, footwear, accessories, equipment, and home products.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products through a mix of wholesale distribution channels, our own DTC channels, independent international distributors, and licensees. Our wholesale channels consist of small, independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores, regional, national and international sporting goods chains, large regional, national and international department store chains, and internet retailers. We sell our products to distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales and marketing operations. We also sell a wide range of apparel, footwear, accessories, equipment, and home products through licensing arrangements with third party manufacturers. In addition, we market Columbia brand apparel and accessories under licensing arrangements with various collegiate and professional sports organizations and entertainment companies.
We also sell our products directly to consumers in each of our geographic segments through our own network of branded and outlet retail stores and online. In addition, we have concession-based arrangements with third-parties at branded, outlet and shop-in-shop retail locations in our Asia Pacific and Europe regions, where the Company retains ownership of inventory and control over certain aspects of operations. Our DTC businesses enable us to increase consumer and retailer awareness of and demand for our products, model compelling retail environments for our products, and strengthen emotional connections between consumers and our brands over time. Our branded retail stores and e-commerce sites allow us to showcase a broad selection of products and to support the brands' positioning with fixtures and imagery that may then be replicated and offered for use by our wholesale and distributor customers. These stores and sites provide high visibility for our brands and products and help us to monitor the needs and preferences of consumers. In addition, we operate outlet stores to sell our products and to serve a role in our overall inventory management by enabling us to profitably liquidate excess, discontinued and out-of-season products while maintaining the integrity of our brands in wholesale and DTC channels. 
We operate in four geographic segments: (1) the United States ("U.S."), (2) Latin America and Asia Pacific ("LAAP"), (3) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and (4) Canada, which are reflective of our internal organization, management and oversight structure. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and distribution of outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. The following table presents Net sales to unrelated entities and approximate percentages of net sales by geographic segment for each of the last three years ended December 31: 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
(Dollars in millions) | Net Sales | | % of Sales | | Net Sales | | % of Sales | | Net Sales | | % of Sales
United States | $ | 1,728.5 | | | 61.7 | % | | $ | 1,520.0 | | | 61.6 | % | $ | 1,505.2 | 63.3 | %
LAAP | 530.1 | | | 18.9 | | | 475.1 | | | 19.3 | | | 453.7 | | 19.1 
EMEA | 350.8 | | | 12.5 | | | 293.7 | | | 11.9 | | | 253.5 | | 10.7 
Canada | 192.9 | | | 6.9 | | | 177.3 | | | 7.2 | | | 164.6 | | 6.9 
Total | $ | 2,802.3 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 2,466.1 | | | 100.0 | % | $ | 2,377.0 | 100.0 | %

U.S. 
The U.S. accounted for 61.7% of our Net sales for 2018. We sell our products in the U.S. to approximately 5,700 wholesale customers and through our own DTC business. As of December 31, 2018, our U.S. DTC business consisted of 113 outlet retail stores and 23 branded retail stores. We also sell our products through our four brand-specific e-commerce websites in the United States. In addition, we earn licensing income in the United States based on our licensees' sale of licensed products.
4

We distribute the majority of our products sold in the U.S. from distribution centers that we own and operate in Portland, Oregon and Robards, Kentucky. In some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from contract manufacturers through third-party logistics companies or directly to wholesale customer-designated facilities in the United States.
LAAP
The LAAP region accounted for 18.9% of our Net sales for 2018. We sell our products in the LAAP region through a combination of wholesale and DTC businesses in China, Japan and Korea and to independent international distributors across the LAAP region.
In Japan and Korea, we sell to approximately 230 wholesale customers. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, there were 120 and 154 concession-based, branded, outlet and shop-in-shop locations in Japan and Korea, respectively. We also sell our products through our four brand-specific e-commerce websites in Japan and Korea. We distribute our products in Japan and Korea through third-party logistics companies that operate warehouses near Tokyo and Seoul, respectively.
In 2014, we commenced operations of a 60% majority-owned joint venture with Swire Resources Limited ("Swire") for purposes of continuing the development of our business in China. We entered into an agreement with Swire in September 2018, in which we committed to buy out the non-controlling interest in the joint venture. On January 2, 2019, we closed the buyout of the 40% non-controlling interest. We operate 83 retail store locations and sell products through brand-specific e-commerce websites in China across multiple platforms and have distribution relationships with approximately 50 wholesale dealers that operate approximately 630 retail locations. We distribute our products to wholesale customers, through our own retail stores and through e-commerce channels in China through a third-party logistics company with a warehouse in Shanghai. 
We sell to international independent distributors who sell our products in locations throughout the LAAP region. The majority of sales to our LAAP distributors are shipped directly to the distributor from the contract manufacturers from which we source our products.
EMEA
The EMEA region accounted for 12.5% of our Net sales for 2018. We sell our products to wholesale customers and independent international distributors who sell our products in locations throughout the EMEA region. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we operated 32 outlet, shop-in-shop and concession-based locations and 1 branded retail store in various locations in Western Europe. We also sell products through brand-specific e-commerce websites in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 
We distribute the majority of our products sold in the EMEA region through a distribution center that we own and operate in Cambrai, France. The majority of sales to our EMEA distributors are shipped directly to the distributor from the contract manufacturers from which we source our products. 
Canada
Canada accounted for 6.9% of our Net sales for 2018. We sell our products in Canada to approximately 1,300 wholesale customers. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we operated 9 outlet retail stores in Canada. We also sell products through brand-specific e-commerce websites in Canada. 
We distribute the majority of our products sold in Canada from a distribution center that we own and operate in London, Ontario. 
Marketing
Our portfolio of brands enables us to target a wide range of consumers across the globe with differentiated products. We believe our marketing supports and enhances our competitive position in the marketplace, drives global alignment through seasonal initiatives, builds brand equity, raises global brand relevance and awareness, infuses our brands with excitement, and, most importantly, stimulates consumer demand for our products worldwide. During 2018, we invested approximately 5.4% of our Net sales in marketing programs.
Our integrated marketing efforts deliver consistent messages about the performance benefits, features and styling of our products within each of our brands. Our target audiences vary by brand and we utilize a variety of means to deliver our marketing messages, including online advertising and social media, television and print publications, experiential events, branded retail stores in select high-profile locations, enhanced product displays in partnership with various wholesale customers and independent international distributors, and consumer focused public relations efforts.
We work closely with our key wholesale customers to reinforce our brand messages through online, television, radio, and print advertising campaigns, as well as in stores using branded visual merchandising display tools. We also utilize our own employees or contractors to visit our customers' retail locations in major cities around the world to facilitate favorable in-store presentation of our products. 
We operate branded e-commerce websites or marketing websites in North America, Europe, Japan, Korea, and China, and maintain a presence on a variety of global social media platforms to connect with consumers. In addition, we authorize our distributors to operate 
5

e-commerce or marketing websites, or both, and to maintain a presence on social media platforms, which help to reinforce our brand messages. Through digital media, consumers are able to interact with content created to inform and connect them with our brands and products, to be directed to nearby retailers and to purchase our products directly. Use of digital marketing and social media has become increasingly important within each of our brands' global efforts to build strong emotional connections with consumers through consistent, brand-enhancing content.
Working Capital Utilization
We design, develop, market, and distribute our products, but do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. As a result, most of our capital is invested in short-term working capital assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable from customers, and finished goods inventory. At December 31, 2018, working capital assets accounted for approximately 75% of Total assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, the degree to which we efficiently utilize our working capital assets can have a significant effect on our profitability, cash flows and return on invested capital. The overall goals of our working capital management efforts are to maintain an optimal level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers to satisfy end consumer demand, to alleviate manufacturing capacity constraints and to drive efficiencies, as well as to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers.
Demand Planning and Inventory Management 
As a branded consumer products company, inventory represents one of the largest and highest risk capital commitments in our business model. We begin designing and developing our seasonal product lines approximately 12 months prior to soliciting advance orders from our wholesale customers and approximately 18 months prior to the products' availability to consumers in retail stores. As a result, our ability to forecast and produce an assortment of product styles that matches ultimate seasonal wholesale customer and end-consumer demand and to deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner can significantly affect our sales, gross margins and profitability. For this reason, we maintain and continue to make substantial investments in information systems, processes and personnel that support our ongoing demand planning efforts. The goals of our demand planning efforts are to develop a collaborative forecast that drives the timely purchase of an adequate amount of inventory to satisfy demand, to minimize transportation and expediting costs necessary to deliver products to customers by their requested delivery dates and to minimize excess inventory to avoid liquidating excess, end-of-season goods at discounted prices. The demand planning process has become more complex as an increased proportion of the forecast is for in-season replenishment that is not confirmed until later in the selling period. Failure to achieve our demand planning goals could reduce our revenues or increase our costs, or both, which would negatively affect our gross margins and profitability and could affect our brand strength. 
In order to manage inventory risk, we use incentive discounts to encourage our wholesale customers to place orders at least six months in advance of scheduled delivery. We generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent international distributors for the fall and spring seasons based on seasonal ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts to plan manufacturing volumes to meet demand. 
We use those advance orders, together with forecasted demand from our DTC businesses, forecasted wholesale order cancellations, reorders and replenishment orders, market trends, historical data, customer and sales feedback, and other important factors to estimate the volumes of each product to purchase from our suppliers around the world. The competitive landscape with our suppliers has resulted in our efforts to extend our buying periods and to procure products earlier in the seasonal period. From the time of initial order through production, receipt and delivery, we attempt to manage our inventory to reduce risk. We generally ship the majority of our advance spring season orders to customers beginning in January and continuing through June. Similarly, we typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to customers beginning in July and continuing through December. Generally, orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment.
Our inventory management efforts cannot entirely eliminate inventory risk due to the inherently unpredictable nature of unseasonable weather, consumer demand, the ability of customers to cancel their advance orders prior to shipment, and other variables that affect our customers' ability to take delivery of their advance orders when originally scheduled. To minimize our purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery, we place a significant amount of orders for our products with contract manufacturers prior to receiving our customers' advance orders and we maintain an inventory of select products that we anticipate will be in greatest demand. In addition, we build calculated amounts of inventory to support estimated at-once orders from customers and auto-replenishment orders on certain long-lived styles.
6

Credit and Collection
We extend credit to our wholesale customers and distributors based on an assessment of each customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist us in scheduling production with our suppliers and delivering seasonal products to our customers on time, we may offer customers discounts for placing early advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before peak seasonal shipping periods. These extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectable receivables. In order to manage the inherent risks of customer receivables, we maintain and continue to invest in information systems, processes and personnel skilled in credit, risk analysis and collections. In some markets and with some customers we use credit insurance, customer deposits or standby letters of credit to minimize our risk of credit loss. 
Sourcing and Manufacturing 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. Virtually all of our products are manufactured to our specifications by contract manufacturers located outside the U.S. We seek to establish and maintain long-term relationships with key manufacturing partners, but generally do not maintain formal long-term manufacturing volume commitments. We believe that the use of contract manufacturers enables us to substantially limit our invested capital and to avoid the costs and risks associated with owning and operating large production facilities and managing large labor forces. We also believe that the use of contract manufacturers greatly increases our production capacity, maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing. We manage our supply chain from a global and regional perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment, including political risks, factory capacity, import limitations and costs, raw material costs, availability and cost of labor, and transportation costs. Without long-term commitments, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate or timely production capacity or favorable pricing terms. 
Our apparel, accessories and equipment are manufactured in 14 countries, with Vietnam and China accounting for approximately 61% of our 2018 apparel, accessories and equipment production. Our footwear is manufactured in three countries, with China and Vietnam accounting for substantially all of our 2018 footwear production.
Our five largest apparel, accessories and equipment factory groups accounted for approximately 32% of 2018 global apparel, accessories and equipment production, with the largest factory group accounting for approximately 11% of 2018 global apparel, accessories and equipment production. Our five largest footwear factory groups accounted for approximately 80% of 2018 global footwear production, with the largest factory group accounting for approximately 38% of 2018 global footwear production. Most of our largest suppliers have multiple factory locations, thus reducing the risk that unfavorable conditions at a single factory or location would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
We maintain nine manufacturing liaison offices in a total of seven Asian countries. Personnel in these manufacturing liaison offices are direct employees of Columbia and are responsible for overseeing production at our contract manufacturers. We believe that having employees physically located in these regions enhances our ability to monitor factories for compliance with our policies, procedures and standards related to quality, delivery, pricing, and labor practices. Our quality assurance process is designed to ensure that our products meet our quality standards. We believe that our quality assurance process is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products. In addition, independent contractors that manufacture products for us are subject to standards of manufacturing practices ("SMP"). Columbia sources products around the world and values legal, ethical and fair treatment of people involved in manufacturing our products. Each factory producing products for us is monitored regularly against these standards. Additional information about our SMP and corporate responsibility programs may be found at www.columbia.com and www.prana.com. The content on our websites is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
Competition
The markets for outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment are highly competitive. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the end-use markets are brand strength, product innovation, design, functionality, durability, and price, as well as the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the ability to align speed of product delivery with consumer expectations. 
In each of our geographic markets, our brands face significant competition from numerous competitors, some of which are larger than we are and have greater financial, marketing and operational resources with which to compete, and others that are smaller with fewer resources but that may be deeply entrenched in local markets. The markets in Japan, China and Korea have attracted a large number of competitive local and global brands. In other markets, such as Europe, we face competition from brands that hold significant market share in one or several European markets but are not significant competitors in other key markets. Some of our large wholesale customers also market competitive apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment under their own private label brand names. In addition, our DTC businesses expose us to branded competitors and wholesale customers who operate retail stores in key markets and who sell competitive products online. Our independent international distributors and licensees also operate in very competitive markets and compete against a variety of local and global brands.
7

In addition to competing for end-consumer and wholesale market share, we also compete for manufacturing capacity of independent factory groups, primarily in Asia, for retail store locations in key markets and for experienced management, staff and suppliers to lead, operate and support our global business processes. Each of these areas of competition requires distinct operational and relational capabilities and expertise in order to create and maintain long-term competitive advantages.
Government Regulation
Many of our international shipments are subject to existing or potential governmental tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, such as import duties and potential safeguard measures that may limit the quantity of various types of goods that may be imported into the United States and other countries. These trade barriers often represent a material portion of the cost to manufacture and import our products. Our products are also subject to domestic and foreign product safety and environmental standards, laws and other regulations, which are increasingly restrictive and complex. As we strive to achieve technical innovations, we face a greater risk of compliance issues with regulations applicable to products with complex technical features. Although we diligently monitor these standards and restrictions, a state, federal or foreign government may impose new or adjusted quotas, duties, safety requirements, material restrictions, or other restrictions or regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 6,511 full-time equivalent employees.
