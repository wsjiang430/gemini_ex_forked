DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Arion Group Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 7, 2016 and established a fiscal year end of January 31. We are currently a start-up company exploring various manufacturing and distribution business opportunities in the dietary ingredient and nutritional supplement industry. However, as of the filing of this statement 10-K, no definitive agreement has been entered into in connection with our business plan related to the above targeted industry.
 
On Nov 21, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), a change in control of the Company occurred, pursuant to which Mr. Mingyong Huang acquired a total of 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (or approximately 65.53% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of the date of acquisition) from Ms. Nataliia Kriukova, the previous principal shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to the SPA and other related agreements, Ms. Nataliia Kriukova resigned from all management and Board positions. The Company also paid off shareholder loan owed to Ms. Kriukova in the amount of $2,663 with cash and inventory on hand pursuant to the PSA on November 21, 2018.
 
Prior to November 21, 2018, we distributed an assortment of cedar phyto barrels in the USA and Europe. Our products were offered at prices marked-up from 80% to 100% of our cost. Our customers were asked to pay us 100% in advance. We filled placed orders and supplied the products within a period of thirty days (30) days or less following receipt of any written order. Customers were responsible for the custom duties, taxes, insurance or any other additional charges that might incur. The business of distribution of cedar phyto barrels was discontinued after November 21, 2018.
 
Concurrent with change of control, we have changed our business plan to focus on medical & health care industry, including consulting services provided to third parties for planning, design and compliance of cannabis cultivation in the USA. However, as of January 31, 2019, we have generated only $2,000 of revenue from the consulting services.
