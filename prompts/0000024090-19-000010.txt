Item 1.   BUSINESS
Overview
Citizens, Inc. ("Citizens" or the "Company") is an insurance holding company incorporated in Colorado serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.  We had approximately $1.6 billion of assets at December 31, 2018 and approximately $4.4 billion of insurance in force.  Our core insurance operations include:

• | U.S. dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies predominantly sold to foreign residents, located principally in Latin America and the Pacific Rim, through independent marketing consultants;


• | ordinary whole life insurance policies to middle income households concentrated in the Midwest, Mountain West and southern United States through independent marketing consultants; and


• | final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel and funeral homes.

During the last five years, except for 2018, our business, revenues and assets have continued to grow, driven primarily by continued new and renewal sales and increased investment income. From 2014 through 2018, revenues rose 6% from $230.2 million in 2014 to $244.0 million in 2018, but declined approximately 3% in 2018 compared to 2017.  During that same period, our assets grew 14% from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, and our net income was impacted by non-recurring tax items in the last two years and declined 85% from net loss of $6.0 million in 2014 to a net loss of $11.1 million in 2018. Net income before federal income taxes was $(2.0) million in 2014 and $2.0 million in 2018. See Item 6.  "Selected Financial Data" and Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Report.
Strategic Initiatives
The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and executive management team are continuing their assessment of the Company's international and domestic business models and strategies with the assistance and support of external consultants and advisors.  Our strategic realignment of the Company's international business model is ongoing under the leadership of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Marketing Officer.  Specifically, we are focused on (1) introducing new products in the international market and increasing our profitability in both international and domestic markets for our Life segment and our Home Service segment; (2) a potential restructuring of our international business and operations that may include withdrawals from certain markets; (3) a strategic modernization and upgrade from our legacy technology systems and IT operations with a focus on digitization, our future business needs and cyber risk; (4) effectively operating our international life insurance business offshore in Bermuda through CICA Life Ltd.; and (5) assessing and optimizing our investment portfolio strategy.
We completed a novation of all of the international policies issued by CICA Life Insurance Company of America, a Colorado corporation ("CICA") to CICA Life Ltd., a newly established Bermuda entity ("CICA Ltd."), effective July 1, 2018. Both CICA and CICA Ltd. are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. As previously disclosed, Bermuda was chosen for its strong insurance regulatory environment and suitability with the Company's priorities to protect our customers. We expect to operate our international business exclusively from this entity going forward. For more information on the impact of the novation, see the discussion in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report and Note 1 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 9 - "Income Taxes" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. As the Company continues its strategic review, it may make further changes to its business model in the future.
We announced in April 2018 a decision to discontinue accepting life insurance applications from Brazilian residents or citizens. We recorded premiums from the Brazilian portion of our business of $10.0 million or 7.2% of total international premiums as of December 31, 2018 compared to $11.1 million or 7.6% as of December 31, 2017. The Company is continuing to assess the financial impacts of this change, but based upon the information to date, we do not anticipate that it will be material to our financial results of operations. The Company intends to continue fulfilling commitments under existing policies and to refocus its resources on other more attractive potential markets, products and opportunities.

In coordination with our business model changes we are actively monitoring quantitative changes in sales patterns as well as qualitative feedback from our independent sales consultants and policyholders to identify and analyze long term business trends, while simultaneously exploring opportunities to mitigate any negative impacts and put the Company on a path toward sustainable profits and growth.
As a result of the Company’s strategic review of its technology systems, the Company implemented technology upgrades in 2018 to support its ongoing operations and initiatives. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company completed the implementation of a new Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") application, which replaced several of the Company's back-office legacy systems, such as the general ledger, accounts payable, cash management, and fixed asset systems. The introduction of this new ERP application and the related workflow changes resulted in changes to the Company’s financial reporting controls and procedures. These system changes were undertaken to standardize accounting systems, improve management reporting and consolidate accounting functions for the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Company also implemented a new actuarial valuation and modeling system, GGY AXIS, as of July 1, 2018 for CICA and CICA Ltd. actuarial reporting to provide enhanced modeling capabilities. The impact of this system conversion resulted in changes in estimates due to refinements reflected as a decrease in reserves of $10.2 million and a decrease in DAC of $4.3 million, before tax. This implementation also resulted in changes to our financial reporting controls and procedures during the third and fourth quarters of 2018.
The low interest rate environment has required us to reduce the policy-related benefits and policyholder dividends for most of our policies offered internationally in reaction to the compressed spreads.  Prior to 2017, our policies provided significantly higher guarantees and policyholder dividends that were not sustainable within the then-current financial markets and our return from our then-current investments.  As a result, the Company reduced discretionary dividends on existing international policies in 2016, which lowered our dividend expense from $10.7 million in 2015 to $6.8 million, $6.2 million and $6.3 million for the years ended 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In addition, in 2017, the Company repriced products sold internationally to better align with the current low interest rate environment we faced. Sales have been depressed on these new products compared to the previously higher guaranteed products they replaced. We expect to issue some newly enhanced products in 2019 that we believe will be more desirable to our international clients.
The Company hired a third-party investment manager in May 2018 to manage, supervise and direct the Company's investment accounts and enhance our portfolio and investment strategies. We routinely monitor the portfolio's rate of return as compared to the product features in our insurance policies and strive to maximize returns on our investment portfolio within our conservative investment guidelines. Our primary objective is to grow bottom-line returns for our shareholders.  We monitor the risk that changes to our products will result in lower demand for our new policies, or that the financial markets will make our investment strategy more difficult to maintain a rate of return. 
The following pages describe the operations of our two business segments:  Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance. CICA, CICA Ltd. and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC") constitute the Life segment, and Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC") and Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") constitute the Home Service segment. In addition to the Life Insurance and Home Service business, the Company also has other non-insurance operations ("Other Non-Insurance Enterprises") which primarily include the Company's IT and Corporate-support functions. 
Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. For more information about the financial performance of our business segments, see Note 8 - "Segment and Other Operating Information" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Life Insurance
Our Life Insurance segment issues U.S. Dollar-denominated endowment contracts internationally which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection and ordinary whole life insurance U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts sold to foreign residents.  These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured and may utilize rider benefits to provide additional increasing or decreasing coverage and annuity benefits to enhance accumulations.  For the majority of our business, we retain the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk.  Historically we have operated this segment through our CICA and CNLIC insurance subsidiaries. Since, July 1, 2018, we have operated the novated international business in this segment through CICA Ltd. We operate our domestic business in this segment through CICA and CNLIC.

International Sales
We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.  We have participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975.  We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:

• | larger face amount policies typically issued when compared to our U.S. operations, which results in lower underwriting and administrative costs per unit of coverage;


• | premiums typically paid annually rather than monthly or quarterly, which reduces our administrative expenses, accelerates cash flow and results in lower policy lapse rates than premiums with more frequently scheduled payments; and


• | persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to U.S. policies.

As of December 31, 2018, we had insurance policies in force in more than 20 countries, including Colombia, Venezuela, Taiwan, Ecuador and Brazil as our top producing countries. As discussed above, we decided in 2018 to discontinue accepting new life insurance applications from Brazilian residents or citizens. In 2018, international direct premiums comprised approximately 96% of total direct premiums in the Life segment and 72% of our total direct premiums.
Our independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.  We maintain contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products. However, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.  Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we expect we would seek to continue the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms. Our agreements with independent marketing firms and consultants typically provide that they are independent contractors responsible for their own operational expenses and are the representative of the prospective insured.  In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.  The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.  All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
International Products
We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.  These policies have been structured to provide:

• | U.S. Dollar-denominated cash values that accumulate, beginning in the first policy year, to a policyholder during his or her lifetime;


• | premium rates that are competitive with most foreign local companies;


• | a hedge against local currency inflation;


• | protection against devaluation of foreign currency;


• | capital investment in a more secure economic environment (i.e., the U.S.); and


• | lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.

Our international products have living benefit features. Most policies contain guaranteed cash values and are participating (i.e., provide for cash dividends as apportioned by the Board).  Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to policy cash dividends as well as annual premium benefits if the annual premium benefit was elected.  According to the policy language, the policyowner has several options with regard to the policy dividends and annual premium benefits. Any annual policy cash dividend may, at the option of the policyowner and provided the value of a dividend is not encumbered by a policy loan, be applied under one of the following options: (1) paid in cash to the policy owner; (2) credited toward payment of premiums on the policy; (3) left with the Company to accumulate at a defined interest rate; (4) applied to increase the amount of insurance benefit by purchase of paid-up additions to the policy; or (5) be assigned to a third-party. If the policy is encumbered by a loan, only option (3) will apply to secure the outstanding loan. Similarly, all annual premium benefits credited to the policy may at the option of the policyowner, and provided the policy is not encumbered by a policy loan, be applied under one of the following options: (1) paid in cash to the policy owner; (2) credited toward payment of premiums on the policy; (3) left with the Company to accumulate at an annually company declared interest rate; or (4) be assigned to a third-party. Likewise, 
5

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

if the policy is encumbered by a loan, only option (3) will apply to secure the outstanding loan. Under the "assigned to a third-party" provision, the Company has historically allowed policyowners, after receiving a copy of the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "CISIP") prospectus and acknowledging their understanding of the risks of investing in Citizens Class A common stock, the right to assign policy values outside of the policy to the CISIP, which is administered in the United States by Computershare, Trust Company, N.A., our plan administrator and an affiliate of Computershare Inc., our transfer agent. The CISIP is a direct stock purchase plan available to policyowners, shareholders, our employees and directors, independent consultants, and other potential investors through the Computershare website. The Company has registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable to participants under the CISIP on a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") that is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Computershare administers the CISIP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CISIP, which is available on the Computershare website and as part of the Company’s registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
International Competition
The life insurance business is highly competitive.  We compete with a number of stock and mutual life insurance companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.  There are more than 700 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.  A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces. 
Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. dollars, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.  We believe our international policies are usually acquired by individuals in the upper middle class in their respective countries and those with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries.  The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.  Our mortality charges are typically lower due to our customer demographics, which provides a competitive advantage.  Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
Domestic Sales
In 2018, domestic direct premiums comprised approximately 4% of total direct premiums in the Life segment and 3% of our total direct premiums. The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 20 years.  We discontinued new sales of our non-Home Service domestic products beginning January 1, 2017. Under the direction of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Marketing Officer, we are reviewing our domestic strategy.
Domestic Life Insurance Products
Our domestic life insurance products have historically focused primarily on living needs and provided benefits focused toward accumulating financial benefits for the policyowner.  The features of our domestic life insurance products include:

• | cash accumulation/living benefits;


• | tax-deferred interest earnings;


• | guaranteed lifetime income options;


• | monthly income for surviving family members;


• | accidental death benefit coverage options; and


• | an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.

Our life insurance products have historically been designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.  The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.

Domestic Home Service Insurance
Our domestic Home Service segment operates through our subsidiaries SPLIC, MGLIC and SPFIC, and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.  Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 311 employee-agents who work on a route system and through over 350 funeral homes and independent agents who sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.  To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents. In 2018, our Home Service segment comprised 25%, or $47.5 million of our total direct premiums.
Home Service Products and Competition
Our Home Service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.  The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $7,000 in 2018. Due to the lower risk associated with small face amount polices, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.  Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000. We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.  We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.  We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales.
Other Non-Insurance Enterprises
Other Non-Insurance Enterprises includes the results of the parent company, Citizens, Inc., and Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company.  As of December 31, 2018, Insurance Investors, Inc., which previously provided aviation transportation to the Company, was dissolved into its parent, CICA.
Operations and Technology
Our administrative operations principally serve our Life Insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 120 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.  Our home service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our service center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, actuarial, customer service, claims processing, administrative and investing activities. We added three personnel to our office location in Bermuda related to CICA Ltd. operations in 2018. We perform underwriting, policy issuance and claims processing relating to our international policies from our Bermuda location.
We have a single integrated information technology system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.  Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set-up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated data edits, storage backup, image management and other related functions.  Each company we acquire has been converted onto our administrative system.  This system has been in place for more than 30 years and has been updated on an ongoing basis as technology has evolved.
We are currently reviewing technology options to transition from our legacy administration system to an upgraded, modernized technology platform that will service our policy administration needs into the future. For our current block of insurance contracts under administration and accounting, we have outsourced the operations and maintenance of our legacy system to a third-party provider.

Enterprise Risk Management
The Company has an enterprise risk management function ("ERM") that analyzes the Company’s risks on an individual and aggregated basis and is responsible for ensuring that the Company’s risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances as determined by management with oversight from the Audit Committee. The Company's focus on ERM strengthens its risk management culture and discipline. The mission of ERM is to support the Company in achieving its strategic priorities by:

• | Providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the Company, including risk concentrations and correlations;


• | Helping management define the Company’s overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk return profile of the business relative to the Company’s strategic intent and financial underpinning;


• | Assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the Company’s overall risk philosophy;


• | Communicating and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and


• | Providing insight to assist in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines.

Enterprise Risk Management Structure and Governance
Effective risk oversight is an important priority for the Company’s Board and senior management team. While it is the job of the President and Chief Executive Officer and senior management to assess and manage the Company’s risk exposure through ERM, in accordance with New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") requirements, the Audit Committee of the Board is charged with discussing guidelines and policies to govern the process by which ERM is handled. The Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company’s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.
The five broad categories of risk exposures assessed and managed by senior management include, but are not limited to:

• | Strategic risk, including international business risks;


• | Insurance risk, including those arising out of catastrophes and acts of terrorism;


• | Financial risk, including market, credit and liquidity risks;


• | Operational risk, including cybersecurity risk and legal and regulatory compliance risks; and


• | Any other risk that poses a material threat to the operational and/or strategic viability of the Company.

In addition to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee considers the risks and rewards that may be implicated by our executive compensation philosophy and programs, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company’s governance practices, director succession and committee composition and leadership to manage risks associated with corporate governance. Although risk oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, the full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding the committees’ considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company. 
Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the U.S. states and Bermuda.
U.S. Regulation
Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.  State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.  In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business.  We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.  Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.  The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and 
8

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

has resulted in changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.  Its requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state) and establishing a new Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. The FIO is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. However, the FIO’s limited monitoring abilities posed minimal risk to the insurance industry and the Dodd-Frank Act has had no significant impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The rulemaking process going forward may change with the current presidential administration. 

The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.  Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.  In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.  It is our practice to fully and consistently cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 31 states and in the District of Columbia.  We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and in Bermuda.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.  The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.  In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.

All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority with financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.  These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.  Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.  For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective state or jurisdiction of domicile.  The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.  In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.

The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.

Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.  The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.  RBC requirements weight the type of business underwritten by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.  Should the ratio of adjusted 
9

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions would be required by the affected company, including submitting a capital plan to the Department of Insurance in the insurance company's state of domicile.
International Regulation 
CICA Ltd., our Bermuda domiciled subsidiary, is subject to regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the "BMA") and compliance with all applicable Bermuda law and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to Bermuda’s Insurance Act 1978 (the "Insurance Act"). 
CICA Ltd., which is incorporated to carry on long-term business, is registered as a Class E insurer, which is the license class for long-term insurers and reinsurers with total assets of more than $500 million that are not registrable as a single-parent or multi-owner long-term captive insurer or reinsurer. CICA Ltd. is not licensed to conduct general business. The Insurance Act regulates the insurance business of CICA Ltd. and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA.
The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Certain requirements of the Insurance Act include: the filing of annual statutory financial returns; the filing of annual U.S. GAAP financial statements; the filing of annual capital and solvency return; the delivery of a declaration of compliance; compliance with minimum enhanced capital requirements; compliance with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct; compliance with minimum solvency margins; limitations on dividends and distributions that CICA Ltd. may make to Citizens, Inc., its parent company; preparation of an annual Financial Condition Report providing details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework, solvency and financial performance; preparation of an assessment of an insurer's own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer’s Solvency Self Assessment; the establishment and maintenance of a head and principal office in Bermuda (with certain officers, a principal representative and a director to reside in Bermuda); appointment of an independent auditor; appointment of an actuary approved by the BMA; and compliance with restrictions on certain changes in control of regulated insurers.
Bermuda’s regulatory regime provides a risk-based capital model, termed the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”), as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to their capital. The BSCR framework applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer's assets, liabilities and premiums, including a formula to take into account catastrophe risk exposure.  The BMA established risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin requirements for Bermuda insurers that mandate that a Bermuda domiciled subsidiary’s Enhanced Capital Requirement ("ECR") be calculated by either (a) BSCR, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. CICA Ltd. uses the BSCR in calculating its solvency requirements. The Economic Balance Sheet (“EBS") framework is embedded as part of the BSCR and forms the basis of our ECR.

In order to minimize the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation and in moving towards the implementation of a risk-based capital approach, the BMA has established a threshold capital level (termed the Target Capital Level ("TCL")), set at 120 percent of ECR, that serves as an early warning tool for the BMA. Failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL would likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight. 
All Bermuda “exempted companies” are exempt from certain Bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non-Bermudians. However, exempted companies may not participate in certain enumerated business transactions, including the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda not in furtherance of the business carried on outside Bermuda or under license granted by the Bermuda Minister of Finance. Generally, it is not permitted without a special license granted by the Bermuda Minister of Finance to insure Bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of, in or based in Bermuda.
In December 2018, the Economic Substance Act 2018 (the “ESA”) came into effect in Bermuda. Under the provisions of the ESA, every Bermuda registered entity engaged in a “relevant activity” must satisfy economic substance requirements by maintaining a substantial economic presence in Bermuda. Under the ESA, insurance or holding entity activities (both as defined in the ESA and Economic Substance Regulations 2018) are relevant activities. To the extent that the ESA applies to CICA Ltd., we will be required to demonstrate compliance with economic substance requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda. Companies that carry on insurance as a relevant activity are deemed to comply with the economic substance requirements, with respect to their insurance business, if they comply with existing regulatory requirements under the Insurance Act and the applicable provisions of Bermuda's Companies Act 1981.

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country. Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country. We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country or jurisdiction, except with respect to Bermuda, where CICA Ltd. is domiciled, and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency. We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries. We have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries. The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country. There is a lack of uniform regulation, lack of clarity in certain regulations and lack of legal precedent in addressing circumstances similar to ours. Our compliance review has confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain jurisdictions, as described in detail in "Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business." We are exploring alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions.
