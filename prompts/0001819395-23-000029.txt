Item 1. Business
Overview
We are on a mission to revolutionize hospitality through innovative, tech-enabled service, and inspiring, thoughtfully designed accommodations combined into one seamless experience. Sonder was born from a desire to offer the modern traveler better accommodation choices than unremarkable “big box” hotels, often unreliable home-shares, and overly expensive boutique hotels. We lease and operate a variety of accommodation options — from fully-equipped serviced apartments to spacious hotel rooms — in 43 cities in 10 countries. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 9,700 units available for guests to book at over 250 properties. 
We work directly with real estate owners to lease properties that meet our standards, furnish and decorate them to provide a design-led, technology-enabled experience, and then make them available for guests to book directly (through the Sonder app, our website, or our sales personnel) or through indirect channels (such as Airbnb, Expedia, Booking.com, and other online travel agencies). We manage our properties using proprietary and third-party technologies and deliver services to guests via the Sonder app and 24/7 on-the-ground support. Our mobile-first guest experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com or another channel. Incorporating technology into all aspects of the business, we offer consistent quality at a compelling value to our guests. 
Our accommodations come in a variety of shapes and sizes to suit guests’ needs – from a multiple-bedroom apartment with fully-equipped kitchen and private laundry facilities, to a hotel room or suite. Our diverse product portfolio serves various traveler types, including leisure travelers, families, digital nomads, and business travelers. Our interior designers and other teams take pride in bringing inspiring spaces to life throughout our portfolio. 
In addition to modern design, we apply technology across our business. Our guest-facing technology leads guests through their entire Sonder experience, beginning with easy, intuitive browsing of our full portfolio and reserving a unit, to in-app check-in and requests for intra-stay cleans or other services. Technology also underpins our hospitality operations, from underwriting and supply growth, to building openings, pricing and revenue management, demand generation, interior design, and day-to-day operations. By leveraging technology, our goal is to reduce operating costs and provide both a better guest experience and a compelling value.
Focus on Enhancing the Guest Experience
We strive to deliver a better way to stay through technology and design and put the guest experience at the center of everything we do. 
We have reimagined the guest journey based on a belief that the ubiquity of mobile devices provides an opportunity to modernize the traveler’s entire experience, alongside the anticipation of guest needs and a design-focused experience. Our technology puts guests in full control of their stay. The Sonder mobile-first guest experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com, the Sonder app, directly with our sales personnel, or through one of our indirect channels such as Airbnb, Expedia or Booking.com. All guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with our services and enhance their stay, but use of the Sonder app is not required.
The Sonder app puts the “lobby on your phone” and empowers guests to seamlessly navigate their entire journey, from booking through check-out. This includes:
•Search, Discovery & Booking: Easy, intuitive browsing and booking of any unit in our portfolio;
•Check-In: Virtual check-in, online receipt of access instructions, and the ability to request and confirm an early check-in directly through the Sonder app; 
•One-Touch WiFi: In-app, one-touch connections to our speedy WiFi;
•Digital Concierge: Curated localized recommendations, available through the app, to help guests navigate each neighborhood’s unique experiences;
•Customer Service On Demand: App-based service requests, connecting guests with our local city team members who are ready to provide timely assistance; and
•Check-out: In-app requests for late check-out and information regarding on- and off-premises baggage storage. The simple app-based check-out process further engages guests by automatically following up with surveys and referral promotion codes.
While the Sonder guest experience aims to be contactless and self-service, our guest services team can be reached 24/7 through the Sonder app, by telephone, text/WhatsApp, and email. For any requests requiring in-person support, we have local team members in each of our cities who are ready to assist.
We also bring a passion for design and creativity to our guests’ experiences. We take pride in the spaces we bring to life through our interdisciplinary teams and external partnerships spanning architecture, product and service design, graphic communications, and more. Our properties have been featured in publications including Surface, Travel + Leisure, Condé Nast Traveler, Elle Decor, Fast Company, Forbes, CNBC, and House Beautiful. Fully equipped kitchens, extra living space, and private laundry facilities are available in many of our apartment-style spaces, providing our guests a wide variety of options whether traveling for leisure or business, individually or as a group. 
Supply Growth
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 9,700 units available for guest bookings (“Live Units”) across 43 cities and 10 countries, with approximately 7,900 additional units for which we have signed real estate contracts but are not yet available for guests to book (“Contracted Units”), diversified across both apartments and hotels. At December 31, 2022, our five largest cities (New York City, Dubai, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and London) accounted for 38.4% of our Live Units, and our 10 largest cities accounted for 59.0% of our Live Units. In 2023, we intend to focus our supply growth efforts primarily on existing Sonder markets, where we have built localized teams and relationships with developers, investors, and property owners for our Live and Contracted Units. In the future, we intend to expand into additional markets in Europe and North America, as well as other locations.
Our properties include 1-, 2-, and 3+ bedroom and studio furnished apartments, nearly all of which include in-unit laundry appliances and fully stocked kitchens, as well as thoughtfully designed studio and 1-bedroom hotel rooms. The majority of our Live and Contracted Units (“Total Portfolio”) consist of commercial or mixed use apartment developments ranging from small ten or 20 unit buildings to modern 300+ unit towers, with larger buildings comprising an increasing proportion of our apartment portfolio in recent years. Over the past few years, we have gone from leasing portions of buildings to now primarily focusing on leasing full buildings going forward.
A smaller, but growing proportion of our portfolio consists of hotels, where we have partnered with independent hotel property owners to convert existing properties into Sonder-branded or co-branded hotels, putting a modern spin on the traditional hotel, with inspiring design and tech-enabled service. 
In the future, we may add resorts and other types of properties to our portfolio. We believe all categories of properties can benefit from better design, modern service, and technology that eliminates inefficiencies.
Demand Generation and Revenue Management 
Historically, we generated demand primarily by listing our units on the websites operated by online travel agencies and Internet-based accommodations marketplaces (“OTAs”). OTAs are paid a percentage channel fee for each Sonder unit booked on their platforms. Today, the primary OTAs that travelers use to book our units are Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia, with 50.1% of 2022 revenue coming through these three OTAs. Guests booking one of our units through an OTA immediately see that their booking is a Sonder property, clearly labeled with the Sonder brand. Guests booking a stay on one of these OTAs can use the Sonder app to manage their stay and enhance their experience, but that is not required.
While OTAs were historically our primary source of demand, we now generate a substantial percentage of revenue directly through Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or our sales personnel. Direct bookings accounted for approximately 47.2% of total revenue in 2022 and 51.6% in 2021. We began experimenting with performance marketing and extended stay discounts on Sonder.com during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to derive direct bookings from modest performance marketing, repeat bookings, and other organic traffic on Sonder.com.
In the last few years, we have also been developing an internal sales team to focus on corporate and group travel, which are significant revenue sources for most hotels but which have not historically been a major revenue source for us. This team’s efforts include building relationships with travel management companies on the global distribution system (“GDS”), corporate relocation and housing companies, and global and local corporate accounts. 
Data-Driven Revenue Management 
Our revenue management team uses analytics and data science to optimize pricing and occupancy levels. This includes software that enables our revenue managers to set pricing strategies on a market-by-market basis, taking into account the anticipated response of occupancy rates to pricing changes. We have built pricing automation technology and a room attribution algorithm, which we use to create competitive and dynamic prices. 
Ancillary Revenue Opportunities 
To complement our typical guest stay revenue, we are continuing to explore opportunities to generate ancillary revenue from value-added services for additional fees. For example, we recently launched guaranteed early check-in and late check-out at some of our properties, available for add-on or separate purchase upon booking or within the Sonder app during a stay. We are also exploring separate charges for room upgrades and value-added room amenities, such as guaranteed parking, and other revenue initiatives.
Leases and Transaction Process 
We lease all of our properties, including both existing buildings and development projects. A majority of our leases are fixed leases, whereby we agree to a fixed periodic fee per unit, many times subject to negotiated rent escalations. We also offer flexible contract structures, including mixed lease structures, whereby we agree to pay the real estate owner a minimum fixed periodic fee, plus a certain share of property revenue, at times with a capped periodic amount, and revenue share agreements, whereby we agree to pay the real estate owner a variable fee based on revenue related metrics as specified in the agreement, rather than a fixed periodic fee. 
Our typical property lease has a 5- to 7-year initial term, with up to two 5-year renewals at our option. Our leases commonly include upfront rent abatement to offset the initial setup costs and revenue ramp for new units. They also frequently include downside protections, including partial rent relief in the event of a recession, regulatory changes, and force majeure events.
Additionally, in many of our leases, we have negotiated an upfront allowance paid by the real estate owner to help offset the capital invested to prepare and furnish a building and the individual units. We are able to negotiate these allowances by offering real estate owners a higher expected yield on their investment, through future lease payments, compared to a deal without an allowance. Effectively, we are compensating real estate owners for providing “furnished” units. By agreeing to such terms, real estate owners can generate higher future cash flows from units while also allowing us to begin operations with much less upfront capital invested. As noted above, we use the term “Contracted Units” to refer to units subject to leases that we have signed, but are not yet ready for guest booking. Certain signed leases have contingencies or conditions that must be satisfied before we take over the units, and from time to time, we exclude some of these leases from our Contracted Units total based on our judgment about the likelihood that the contingencies or conditions will be satisfied. 
Operations 
Our operations teams focus on efficiently and effectively opening new Sonder buildings, providing best practice playbooks for ongoing operations, and serving our guests. The team includes both local service staff focused on building openings and guest service requests requiring in-person assistance, as well as central teams focused on supply chain, interior design, real estate development, guest service, and operational excellence. 
Supply Chain 
In the United States and Canada, we have built a streamlined global supply chain powered by warehouse and inventory management technology. Furniture, art, decor, linens, and other guest facing items are curated and sourced by our centralized sourcing and merchandising team, and initially stored in central warehouses for distribution to local properties. Typically, new buildings receive furniture and decor items all at once, as a full “hotel in a box.” We focus on a high level of furniture quality and reliability while retaining aesthetic appeal and expect our suppliers to abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct (which is informed by internationally recognized social, environmental, and ethical standards). In Europe, the Middle East and Mexico, we work with local providers to deliver a similar aesthetic and grade of product to deliver a high-quality guest experience, brand consistency, and fast deployment. 
Building Openings
Our highly experienced on-the-ground teams focus on onboarding new properties quickly and efficiently. Before welcoming guests to a new property, our local teams ensure that the spaces are immaculately set up and well-photographed. 
Day-to-Day Operations 
Our day-to-day operations are delivered by central and locally based teams, powered by a combination of proprietary and third-party software, to address guests’ inquiries, issues, and requests quickly and effectively. Our central guest services team has hubs in North America, Europe, and Asia. 
Back-of-house teams such as housekeeping — both Sonder-employed and third-party providers—use software to help them deliver clean spaces and resolve any guest issues or requests that might arise. 
Competition 
Given the nature of our business model, we operate in two highly competitive environments: (i) attracting guests; and (ii) securing desirable real estate supply. 
Competition for Guests 
Travelers have many options as they search for a stay that best suits their needs. We compete for guests based on many factors, including the location and quality of accommodations, property amenities, reputation for guest services and guest-facing technologies, pricing, and brand loyalty. Within traditional hospitality, we compete primarily with major incumbent operators in the upscale and upper upscale hotel segments, such as Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt, who have built their brands and customer loyalty over several decades. We also compete against boutique hotel operators and smaller hotel chains, particularly in non-U.S. markets.
Guests are increasingly shifting their hospitality spend to alternative accommodation providers that offer differentiated, often home-like experiences at price points below that of traditional hotels. Within alternative accommodations, we compete with a wide variety of operators, many of which focus on a small number of markets. The alternative accommodation space also includes OTAs such as Airbnb, Vrbo (owned by Expedia Group), and other marketplaces, and various large Internet-based companies that advertise vacation homes, home-shares, hotel rooms, and other travel services. While OTAs market and list competitors’ accommodations, they are also an important channel partner for us. 
Competition for Real Estate Supply 
We compete against various parties for potential new properties in our target markets. On the apartment side, we compete against other leasing styles (e.g., traditional lease-up to 12-month term tenants) as well as other short-term rental companies with similar business models to our own. On the hotel side, we primarily compete against traditional hotel property managers. 
We believe that we offer a compelling value proposition to the developers and owners of apartments and hotels. We provide apartment developers potentially superior economics by eliminating lengthy lease-up periods, minimizing sales and marketing costs, simplifying rent collections from a single master lessee, and removing many daily operational burdens. For independent hotel owners, we offer a steady stream of income while taking the operational headaches off their hands and applying technology and design to improve the property’s performance. We believe that we are the preferred counterparty of many of our partners due to our scaled operations and proven track record. 
Regulatory Compliance 
Our strategy includes rigorous attention to regulatory compliance, as our operations are subject to regulations in the following principal areas, across a wide variety of jurisdictions. 
Property and Accommodations Regulation 
Our business is subject to U.S. and foreign federal, state, and local laws and regulations that vary widely by city, country, and property type. In many cities, local regulations affect our ability to offer accommodations for specified durations or in certain neighborhoods. Hospitality and transient accommodations operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws and regulations relating to accessibility, and to laws, regulations, and standards in other areas such as zoning and land use, licensing, permitting and registrations, fire and life safety, environmental and other property condition matters, staffing and employee training, cleaning protocols, and property “star” ratings where required. Additionally, our real estate owners are responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employees, property maintenance, and operations, environmental laws, and other matters. 
Before signing any new leases in a new market, we engage local legal counsel to help identify relevant regulatory requirements. This research includes analysis on licensing and zoning, building code, accessibility and operations requirements, fire and life safety regulations, tax compliance, and local employment laws. Every leased property has unique characteristics, requiring further due diligence and regulatory analyses before each new lease signing. 
Privacy and Data Protection Regulation
In processing travel transactions and information about guests and their stays, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data. The collection, storage, processing, transfer, use, disclosure, protection, and other processing of this information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, as well as privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various U.S. States and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its implementing regulations (the “CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and the United Kingdom (“UK”) General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and UK Data Protection Act. 
We take various technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols designed to protect data, including data pertaining to guests and employees, and we are engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and considering additional steps to comply with the CCPA/CPRA, EU GDPR, PIPEDA, UK GDPR, UK Data Protection Act, and other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. 
Employment Laws and Regulations 
We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration, workplace safety and health, and hotel-specific ordinances. 
Securities, Accounting, and Nasdaq Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations, and corporate reporting, including the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the listing standards of Nasdaq. 
Other Regulation 
Our business is subject to various other laws and regulations, involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection, online messaging, advertising, and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries or persons. As we expand into additional markets, especially outside of the U.S., we will be subject to additional laws and regulations. 
The regulatory environment in each market is often complex and evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations are inconsistent and ambiguous and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to an innovative hospitality provider such as Sonder, which often makes their application to our business uncertain. For additional information regarding the laws and regulations that affect our business, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 
In 2020, we established a dedicated Sustainability, Partnerships, and Social Impact function that supports, advises and provides best practices on responsible business practices across the organization. We understand the importance of ESG in this context and have taken deliberate steps to begin Sustainable Accounting Standards Board data collection and measurement for future disclosure to investors. Our ESG goal is to foster the social, environmental, and economic well-being of the communities we call home. To do this, we are developing business practices through a “People and Planet” framework. This framework illustrates our commitment to our employees and guests, to the communities in which we operate, and to minimizing our environmental footprint. Initial efforts include, among others, the publication of core corporate social responsibility policies, such as a Supplier Code of Conduct, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) Statement, Modern Slavery Act Statement, and Zero Tolerance policy reflected in the “house rules” applicable to guest stays. We have also implemented a policy granting time-off to permit employees to engage in local U.S. elections, and a Volunteer Time Off Policy to facilitate employee volunteering. Other initiatives of ours focus on sustainability, such as energy, water and the elimination of single-use plastics at Sonder properties. 
Sonder Employees and Culture 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 993 employees in the United States, and approximately 702 employees located in 9 countries outside of the U.S. Our workforce consisted of approximately 995 salaried and approximately 700 hourly employees as of that date. Certain non-U.S. employees are currently represented by unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Culture 
Our people philosophy is to create a workplace where everyone can thrive. 
Our culture is defined by ten leadership principles, which are designed to ignite more innovation, to allow us to move quickly and strategically, to keep us inspired and coordinated, and to help us move faster, be more inspiring, and be a better place to work. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Extending hospitality to all is one of our leadership principles. Living up to that principle means fully embracing diversity so that all of our employees, guests, partners, and communities feel safe, respected, included, cared for, and empowered. 
We are resolute against hate. In accordance with our non-discrimination and harassment policy, we have zero tolerance for racism, sexism, discrimination, intimidation, or violence of any kind. 
An important part of our business mission is a never-ending pursuit to make things better. We are in the early stages of our DEI work as a company. We have created a DEI working group to listen to and to engage employees and evaluate our progress. We have also established several employee resource groups whose aim is to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, contractual provisions, and restrictions on access and use to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
At December 31, 2022, we had 104 trademark registrations and pending applications, including registrations for “Sonder” in the United States, Canada and various other countries, applications and registrations for the Sonder bird logo in 33 countries, and one registration for “Sonder” (and bird logo) and two applications for “SONDER in Chinese Characters” in China. 
In addition to trademark protection, we reserve and register domain names when and where deemed appropriate and are the registered holder of more than 80 domain names, including “sonder.com.” 
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with certain of our employees, consultants, contractors, and business partners. Certain employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in the terms of use on our website and guest app. 
Seasonality 
Seasonality causes period-to-period variances in a particular property’s occupancy and pricing, depending upon seasonal factors such as weather patterns, local events, and holidays, as well as property location and type. Based on results prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue per available room tends to be lower across our portfolio in the first quarter and fourth quarters of each year due to seasonal factors such as weather and holidays and the market mix and product mix of our portfolio at the time. However, the effect of seasonality will vary as our market mix and product mix continues to evolve. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
