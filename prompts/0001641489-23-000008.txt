ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of orally administered treatments for diabetes. We are focused on treating metabolic and inflammatory diseases to minimize their long-term complications and improve the lives of patients. We have an innovative pipeline of first-in-class small molecule clinical and preclinical drug candidates. Our lead program is TTP399, an orally administered, small molecule, liver-selective glucokinase activator (“GKA”) that is a potential adjunctive therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. On April 13, 2021, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for TTP399 as an adjunctive therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on FDA’s determination that preliminary clinical evidence indicates that an investigational therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more significant endpoints relative to available therapies for a serious or life-threatening condition. Once granted, Breakthrough Therapy designation provides a sponsor with added support and the potential to expedite development and review timelines for a promising new investigational medicine. The Breakthrough Therapy designation for TTP399 in type 1 diabetes was supported by the positive results from the Phase 2 SimpliciT-1 Study, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, adaptive study assessing the safety and efficacy of TTP399 as an adjunct to insulin therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes. In this trial, treatment with TTP399 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c relative to placebo and a clinically meaningful decrease (40%) in the frequency of severe and symptomatic hypoglycemia. TTP399 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, in which abnormal levels of serum or urine ketones were detected less frequently in patients taking TTP399 than those taking placebo. Moreover, a Phase 1 mechanistic study of TTP399 in patients with type 1 diabetes to determine the impact of TTP399 on ketone body formation showed no increased risk of ketoacidosis with TTP399 during acute insulin withdrawal in patients with type 1 diabetes. We have completed the study conduct for An Open-Label Phase 1 Study in Healthy Male Subjects to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of [14C]-TTP399 Following Single Dose Oral Administration. Ten participants have been dosed, and analysis is ongoing. We are working on the design for pivotal and registrational studies for TTP399, with input from the FDA, which we expect to launch in 2023. We are currently in active discussions with respect to financing, partnering and/or licensing transactions for the further development of TTP399. 
We also conducted a multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study of HPP737, an orally administered phosphodiesterase type 4 (“PDE4”) inhibitor, to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of HPP737 in healthy volunteers as part of our psoriasis program. Dose escalation up to 20mg/day demonstrated approximate dose proportional increases in exposure, while maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no dose limiting safety or tolerability findings observed. Given the strategic focus of vTv announced on November 9, 2021, development activities in the United States on HPP737 have remained paused while evaluating strategic options for this program, including potential licensing arrangements. 
In addition to our internal development programs, we are continuing to further the development of five partnered programs: a small molecule GLP-1r agonist, TTP273 (in certain Asian territories excluding Japan), the PDE4 inhibitor, HPP737 (in certain Asian territories excluding Japan), a PPAR-δ agonist, HPP593, an Nrf2 activator, HPP971 and the RAGE antagonist, azeliragon, through collaborations with pharmaceutical partners via licensing arrangements. 
Impact of COVID-19
We have been actively monitoring the COVID-19 global health crisis and its impact on our business, employees, patients, partners, suppliers, and vendors. Our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were not significantly impacted by COVID-19. Though our financial results were not significantly impacted, COVID-19 precautions directly and indirectly impacted the timelines for the clinical trials conducted during 2022 and may impact the timelines of the trials currently in process with our partners and being planned. 
vTv has continued to make adjustments that allow us to maintain our business operations despite current circumstances, including establishing remote working options for all employees. Given the current scope of the pandemic, we cannot predict the impact of the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak on future clinical trials and financial results due to a variety of factors, including the continued good health of our employees, the ability of our third-party suppliers, vendors, manufacturers and partners to continue to operate and provide services, the ability of our clinical trial sites to continue or resume operations, any further government and/or public actions taken in response to the pandemic and the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Pipeline
The following table summarizes our current drug candidates and their respective stages of development:
Our Strategy
Our goal is to advance the development of our differentiated pipeline of orally administered, small molecule drug candidates to treat metabolic and inflammatory diseases to minimize their long-term complications and to improve the lives of patients. In December 2021, the Company announced a strategic decision to prioritize the development of its lead program TTP399, a novel, oral, liver-selective glucokinase activator. This decision included a reduction in the Company’s workforce affecting approximately 65% of its employees. We are also actively seeking licensing deals for our other assets. As key components of our strategy, we are focused on:
•Continuing to advance TTP399 as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes. On April 13, 2021, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for TTP399 as an adjunctive therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The Breakthrough Therapy designation for TTP399 in type 1 diabetes was supported by the positive results from the phase 2 SimpliciT-1 Study, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, adaptive study assessing the safety and efficacy of TTP399 as an adjunct to insulin therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes. In this trial, treatment with TTP399 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c relative to placebo and a clinically meaningful decrease (40%) in the frequency of severe and symptomatic hypoglycemia. In addition the mechanistic study in patients with type 1 diabetes to determine the impact of TTP399 on ketone body formation during a period of acute insulin withdrawal indicated no increased risk of ketoacidosis with TTP399 during acute insulin withdrawal in patients with type 1 diabetes. These results are important since the FDA has declined to approve SGLT2 inhibitors as an adjunctive therapy in Type 1 Diabetes ("T1D"), with concerns over the potential increased risks of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in focus. The Company is planning two pivotal, placebo-controlled clinical trials of TTP399 in patients with type 1 diabetes and is engaged with the FDA on the optimal clinical trial designs for these studies. The Company expects to begin these pivotal studies in 2023.
•Seeking additional strategic collaborations and additional funding to support the continued development and commercialization of our development programs. We will continue to seek additional funding to support the further development of our drug candidates. Such support may come from strategic collaborations with non-profit research funding organizations such as JDRF International or from collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. We are currently in active discussions with respect to financing, partnering and licensing transactions for the further development of TTP399.

•Continuing to monitor and support existing partnerships for pipeline programs. Our partners developing our GLP-1r, PPAR-δ, PDE4, and Nrf2 programs continue to advance these assets in their respective licensed territories. We continue to support and monitor these partnerships. 
Our Type 1 Diabetes Program –TTP399
Diabetes Overview
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which a person’s pancreas stops producing insulin (a hormone that enables people to get energy from food). Type 1 diabetes results when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas called beta cells. While the causes of type 1 diabetes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. The onset of type 1 diabetes is not believed to be affected by diet or lifestyle.
Current Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes and Their Limitations
Patients with type 1 diabetes have difficulty achieving and maintaining consistent glycemic control, defined as HbA1c < 7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). In order to maintain appropriate glycemic control, patients with type 1 diabetes are required to constantly monitor their blood glucose levels, closely manage their diet, and administer insulin via injection in response. While technology has advanced to help people with type 1 diabetes manage the burden of this monitoring and insulin administration process, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, patient outcomes have not improved: approximately 80% of people with type 1 diabetes fail to achieve the ADA’s recommended HbA1c levels. Failure to maintain glycemic control results in dangerous excursions into hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia that are potentially fatal. In addition, the accumulated impact of these glycemic excursions can raise a patient’s risk of potentially serious and life-threatening long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage.
Several existing treatment options for type 2 diabetes have been investigated to treat type 1 diabetes, generally without success. While a pair of SGLT-1/2 and SGLT-2 inhibitors were approved in recent years in Europe and Japan with label restrictions to certain sub-groups of people with type 1 diabetes, these therapies have not been approved in the U.S. due to safety risks primarily relating to diabetic ketoacidosis (“DKA”). Alternative therapeutic modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, are under clinical investigation and have demonstrated evidence of the potential to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes. Such alternatives have not completed clinical development or received regulatory approval, nor do they address the unmet need of existing patients with type 1 diabetes or those that eventually become patients with type 1 diabetes following any therapeutic delay in disease onset.
With insulin and pramlintide injection as the only treatment options approved in the United States for type 1 diabetes, there is a serious unmet medical need to provide people with type 1 diabetes additional, especially oral, treatment options that can help them to reduce HbA1c, or the incidence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose levels below normal) or DKA.
The Role of Glucokinase Activation in Diabetes
Glucokinase (“GK”) is a key regulator of glucose homeostasis and acts as the physiological glucose sensor, changing its conformation, activity, and/or intracellular location in parallel with changes in glucose concentrations. GK has two distinctive characteristics that make it a good choice for blood glucose control. First, its expression is mostly limited to tissues that require glucose-sensing (mainly liver and pancreatic β-cells). Second, GK acts as a biological sensor for changes in serum glucose levels and modulates changes in liver glucose metabolism that in turn regulates the balance between hepatic glucose production and glucose consumption and modulates changes in insulin secretion by the β-cells. GK activation is attractive as a potential therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes and has a mechanism of action entirely distinct from currently marketed oral anti-diabetic drugs (“OAD”).
TTP399
TTP399 is an orally administered, small molecule, liver-selective glucokinase activator (“GKA”) in development as an adjunctive therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. TTP399 has a novel mechanism of action: liver-selective activation of GK that seeks to provide intensive glycemic control and a reduction in the risk of hypoglycemia. Our trials for TTP399 to date suggest that our liver-selective approach to GK activation has the potential to avoid the tolerability issues associated with other GKAs, such as activation of GK in the pancreas, stimulation of insulin secretion independent of glucose, hypoglycemia, increased lipids, and liver toxicity. Based on data from Phase 1 and 2 trials to date, we believe that TTP399, if approved, has the potential to be a first-in-class OAD due to its liver-selectivity and novel mechanism of action. We have completed ten Phase 1 and three Phase 2 clinical trials of TTP399, one of which was six months in duration. In our 
Table of Contents

Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, TTP399 was well tolerated with negligible incidence of hypoglycemia in the type 2 diabetes studies and a significant reduction of hypoglycemia observed in the Phase 2 study in type 1 diabetes.
Positive Phase 2 Simplici-T1 Study
In February 2020, we announced positive results from the Simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP399, assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of TTP399 in adult patients with T1D over a 12-week period. The Simplici-T1 Study achieved its primary objective by demonstrating statistically significant improvements in HbA1c for TTP399 compared to placebo. Moreover, a clinically meaningful decrease (40%) in the frequency of severe and symptomatic hypoglycemia was observed in patients taking TTP399 when compared to those taking placebo.
Mechanistic study
In October 2021, we announced positive results from the mechanistic study indicating no increased risk of ketoacidosis with TTP399 during acute insulin withdrawal in patients with type 1 diabetes.
 Consistent with previous clinical studies of TTP399, the drug was well tolerated with fewer subjects reporting treatment-emergent adverse events in the group taking TTP399 than in the placebo group. Importantly, patients taking TTP399 reported no events of hypoglycemia, while four events of hypoglycemia were reported in the placebo group.
Clinical Development Plan
Based upon the positive results of our Simplici-T1 Study, we requested breakthrough treatment designation (BTD) with the FDA which was granted in April 2021.We have completed the study conduct for An Open-Label Phase 1 Study in Healthy Male Subjects to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of [14C]-TTP399 Following Single Dose Oral Administration. Ten participants have been dosed, and analysis is ongoing. The Company is planning two pivotal, placebo-controlled clinical trials of TTP399 in subjects with type 1 diabetes and is engaged with the FDA on the optimal clinical trial designs for these studies. The Company expects to begin these pivotal studies in the second half of 2023. The FDA confirmed that the effect size of TTP399 on events of hypoglycemia as demonstrated in the Phase 2 SimpliciT-1 Study are clinically meaningful and that a reduction in events of hypoglycemia would be an acceptable clinical endpoint for evaluation of an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
Preclinical Development Plan
Long-term toxicology studies and Development and reproductive toxicology studies, have been completed. Carcinogenecity studies are ongoing and expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2024.
Collaboration Agreements
G42 Transaction
On May 31, 2022, the Company and G42 Investments AI Holding RSC Ltd, a private limited company (“G42 Investments”), entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “G42 Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company sold to G42 Investments 10,386,274 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a price per share of approximately $2.41, for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million, which was paid (i) $12.5 million in cash at the closing and (ii) $12.5 million in the form of a promissory note of G42 Investments to be paid on May 31, 2023 (the "G42 Promissory Note"). As part of the G42 Purchase Agreement, G42 Investments nominated a director as appointee and the Company’s board of directors approved appointing the new director to the Company’s board.
G42 Investments has agreed to certain transfer restrictions (including restrictions on short sales or similar transactions) and restrictions on further acquisitions of shares, in each case subject to specified exceptions. Following the expiration of a lock up period, from the period May 31, 2022 until December 31, 2024 (or if earlier, the date of receipt of FDA approval in the United States for TTP399 (the “FDA Approval”) of TTP399), the Company has granted to G42 Investments certain shelf and piggyback registration rights with respect to those shares of Class A common stock issued to G42 Investments pursuant to the G42 Purchase Agreement, including the ability to conduct an underwritten offering to resell such shares under certain circumstances. The registration rights include customary cooperation, cut-back, expense reimbursement, and indemnification provisions.
Contemporaneously with the G42 Purchase Agreement, effective on May 31, 2022, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the “Cogna Agreement”) with Cogna Technology Solutions LLC, an affiliate of G42 Investments (“Cogna”), which requires Cogna to work with the Company in performing clinical trials for the Company’s TTP399 compound (the “Licensed Product”) as well as jointly creating a global development plan to develop, market, and commercialize TTP399 in certain countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia (the “Partner Territory”). Under the 
Table of Contents

terms of the Cogna Agreement, Cogna will obtain a license under certain intellectual property controlled by the Company to enable it to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under the Cogna Agreement, including to develop and commercialize the Licensed Product in the Partner Territory, but will not have access to the various intellectual property related to the license and TTP399. Specifically, the Company will share various protocols with Cogna related to conducting the clinical trials and will provide the patient dosages and placebo of TTP399 needed to conduct the trials. 
Under the Cogna Agreement, Cogna has the right to develop and commercialize the Licensed Product in the Partner Territory at its own cost once restrictions on the use of the IP have been lifted by the Company. The Cogna Agreement determined which specific countries in the Partner Territory that Cogna may pursue development and commercialization and provides the Company with the ability to determine when Cogna can benefit from this IP through the powers granted to the Company to approve the global development plan. Further, the Company may supply at cost, or Cogna may manufacture, TTP399 for commercial sale under terms to be agreed upon by the parties at a later date.
Separately, the Company will conduct its clinical trials for TTP399 outside of the Partner Territory, at its own cost. The results of each party’s clinical trials will be combined by the Company to seek FDA approval in the United States for TTP399. On December 21, 2022, G42 Healthcare Technology Solutions LLC (formerly known as Cogna Technology Solutions LLC) novated its rights and obligations under the Cogna Agreement to G42 Healthcare Research Technology Projects LLC ("G42 Healthcare"), an affiliate of G42 Investments. As a result of the novation, all references to Cogna herein shall be deemed to refer to G42 Healthcare.
The G42 Purchase Agreement also provides for, following the receipt of FDA approval of the Licensed Product, at the option of G42 Investments, either (a) the issuance of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Milestone Shares”) having an aggregate value equal to $30.0 million or (b) the payment by the Company of $30.0 million in cash (the “Milestone Cash Payment”). The issuance of the Milestone Shares or the payment of the Milestone Cash Payment, as applicable, are conditioned upon receipt of the FDA Approval and subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the G42 Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance that the FDA Approval will be granted or as to the timing thereof.
Once commercialization takes place in the Partner Territory, the Company will receive royalties in the single digits from Cogna on the net sales of the Licensed Product for a period of at least ten years after the first commercial sale of the Licensed Product in the Partner Territory.
On February 28, 2023, the Company and G42 Investments amended the G42 Purchase Agreement and modified the G42 Promissory Note to accelerate the payment due under the note. Pursuant to the amendment, on February 28, 2023, the Company received $12.0 million, which reflected the original amount due under the G42 Promissory Note less a 3.75% discount, in full satisfaction of the note. 
CinPax and CinRx Transaction
On July 22, 2022, the Company entered into the CinRx Purchase Agreement with CinPax, LLC (“CinPax”), a subsidiary of CinRx Pharma, LLC (“CinRx”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to CinPax 4,154,549 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a price per share of approximately $2.41, for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million, which was paid (i) $6.0 million in cash at the closing of the transaction and (ii) $4.0 million in the form of a non-interest-bearing promissory note with CinPax and was paid to the Company on November 22, 2022. The CinRx Purchase Agreement provides CinPax the right to nominate a director to be approved on vTv’s Board of Directors and a board observer, which was subsequently approved by the Company’s board. 
The CinRx Purchase Agreement also provides CinRx warrants to purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of Class A common stock at an initial exercise of price of approximately $0.72 per share (the “CinRx Warrants”). The CinRx Warrants will become exercisable by CinRx only if (i) the Company receives FDA approval to market and distribute the pharmaceutical product containing the Company’s proprietary candidate, TTP399, or (ii) the Company is acquired by a third party, sells all or substantially all of its assets related to TTP399 to a third party or grants a third party an exclusive license to develop, commercialize and manufacture TTP399 in the United States. If neither of these events happen within five years of the date of the issuance of the CinRx Warrants, the CinRx Warrants will expire and not be exercisable by CinRx. The exercise price of the CinRx Warrants and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the CinRx Warrants are subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the CinRx Warrants.
Additionally, in conjunction with the CinRx Purchase Agreement the Company and CinRx entered into a Master Service Agreement whereby CinRx provides the Company with consulting, preclinical and clinical trial services, as enumerated in project proposals negotiated between the Company and CinRx from time to time.

Our Psoriasis Program – HPP737 - PDE4 Inhibitor
Psoriasis Overview
Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which the growth cycle of skin is accelerated due to an imbalance in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This results in the proliferation of skin cells and the development of raised, red, silvery scale plaques (i.e., plaque psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris) that has not only medical implications but an impact on a patient’s quality of life. While the specific inciting events for this pro-inflammatory process are unknown psoriasis may be caused by autoimmunity and genetic predisposition. Events such as trauma to the skin, stress, illness, or infection that triggers the immune systems, obesity, and weather have been identified as triggers for flare ups. 
Current Treatment for Psoriasis and Their Limitations
Topical therapies including glucocorticoids and vitamin D analogs are the mainstay of treatment for mild psoriasis. The continuous long-term use of glucocorticoids is limited by the risk of skin thinning / atrophy and the potential for systemic absorption. Vitamin D analogs are often added to glucocorticoids to improve glucocorticoid efficacy while allowing for reduction in glucocorticoid dose. Moderate to severe disease is treated with systemic therapies including oral PDE4 inhibition, immunosuppressants, retinoids, and biologics (ex: anti-TNF agents, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors). Biologics, while realizing high efficacy rates in treating psoriasis, are associated with administration by injection, high cost, need for laboratory monitoring and increased risk of infection. 
Inhibitors of PDE4 act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (“cAMP”), which has a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects. PDE4 activity is increased in the skin of patients with psoriasis leading to up-regulation of immune modulatory, pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines including interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Treatments for psoriasis are aimed at reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine activity. The therapeutic potential of oral PDE4 inhibitors has been limited by dose limiting AEs such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. 
HPP737
HPP737 is an orally administered, potent and selective, non-CNS penetrant PDE4 inhibitor that addresses inflammatory diseases and offers the potential for an improved tolerability profile and efficacy over commercially available PDE4 inhibitors. HPP737 has shown potent inhibition of IL-17a and TNF-α production in in vitro studies and activity in several animal models of inflammation. HPP737 has completed Phase 1 single-ascending dose and initial multiple-ascending dose studies, in which it was well tolerated at all doses tested in healthy volunteers. Clinical data generated to date supports achieving target engagement (reduction in ex vivo LPS stimulated TNF-α) at HPP737 plasma concentrations predicted to be efficacious from preclinical models.
In September 2021, we announced the results of a multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study of HPP737, an orally administered phosphodiesterase type 4 (“PDE4”) inhibitor, to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of HPP737 in healthy volunteers as part of our psoriasis development program. The trial enrolled 12 subjects in each of two dose cohorts, 15mg and 20mg, randomized to receive HPP737 or placebo (3:1) orally once daily for 14 days. Dose escalation up to 20mg once per day demonstrated dose proportional increases in exposure, while maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no dose limiting safety or tolerability findings observed. There were no serious adverse events and no discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events.
Business Plan
Given the new strategic focus of vTv announced on November 9, 2021, development activities in the United States on HPP737 were paused while evaluating strategic options for this program, including potential licensing arrangements. 
Our Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Program – TTP273 - GLP-1r Agonist
Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Overview
Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (“CFRD”) shares some features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes but is distinct, and is likewise categorized as diabetes due to other causes, specifically a disease of the exocrine pancreas by the American Diabetes Association. In people with cystic fibrosis (“CF”), the thick, sticky mucus that is characteristic of the disease causes scarring of the pancreas. This scarring prevents the pancreas from producing normal amounts of insulin. The damaged pancreas also responds to insulin signaling in a delayed manner. The delay and blunting of the insulin response in patients with CFRD results in post-prandial hyperglycemia.
Table of Contents

The Role of GLP-1r Activation in Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes
GLP-1, an incretin hormone that is released by the gut in response to nutrients, lowers postprandial glucose by promoting insulin secretion. Abnormally low postprandial stimulation of incretins has been described in CF patients and improvement in postprandial hyperglycemia has been demonstrated following prandial administration of GLP-1 agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors. Nevertheless, the use of existing GLP-1 mimetics that are available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to treat CFRD is limited by the GI side effects and undesired weight loss associated with these agents.
TTP273
TTP273 is an orally available, small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been demonstrated to reduce postprandial glucose excursion in response to an oral glucose test or mixed meal tolerance test in both preclinical and clinical studies. We believe that TTP273 could be used to treat postprandial hyperglycemia in CFRD patients and CF patients with abnormal post-prandial glucose excursions without inducing hypoglycemia or GI side effects. An oral therapy such as TTP273 is needed because the current method of treatment of CFRD is injected insulin, which comes with associated risks of hypoglycemia and poses additional burdens on patients. Other available oral therapies for type 2 diabetes are not recommended for the treatment of CFRD due to side effects such as hypoglycemia, weight loss, or nausea. In particular, the GLP-1 mimetics currently in the market have been demonstrated to result in increased GI side effects and undesired weight loss, both of which are major drawbacks for patients with CFRD. 
We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP273. Additionally, we have completed nine Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP054, a predecessor orally administered GLP-1r agonist. In our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, TTP273 has been demonstrated to be well-tolerated with lower incidences of GI side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, than placebo with minimal weight loss, especially in non-obese patients.
We are currently planning an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of TTP273, but the final design may be adjusted based on the feedback received, if any, from the FDA and the conduct of this clinical trial is dependent upon securing a funding partner.
Our Nrf2/Bach1 Modulator Program
The Role of Nrf2/Bach1 Modulators
Chronic, unresolved inflammation, oxidative stress, and resulting fibrosis are key features of many diseases. Inflammation is an integral component of the normal immune response that occurs when cells encounter harmful stimuli, such as invading pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. During inflammation, cells activate inflammatory processes and complexes that increase the production of cytokines, which are proteins that recruit and activate immune cells.
Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated. The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of the cell as they produce the energy that the cell needs to function. This energy is produced by converting fatty acids and glucose into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a process called oxidative phosphorylation. During inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism is temporarily reprogrammed to suppress oxidative phosphorylation. Instead of primarily making ATP, the mitochondria divert fatty acids and glucose to increase the production of proinflammatory mediators. During this reprogramming, the mitochondria release chemically reactive molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can directly attack pathogens and amplify the production of cytokines.
In a normal immune response, the resolution of inflammation begins after the harmful stimuli have been eliminated. Nrf2 is a protein that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of specific genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production. When activated, Nrf2 promotes the resolution of inflammation by normalizing mitochondrial metabolism, restoring redox balance, and suppressing cytokine production. 
In many chronic and genetic diseases, Nrf2 activity is suppressed, and the resolution of inflammation fails to occur or is inadequate, leading to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, excess production of ROS, and production of cytokines. These processes cause chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to tissue damage and loss of organ function.
To date, therapeutic agents seeking to active Nrf2, such as such as Bardoxolone or Tecfidera, have relied on reactive, electrophilic biological targets that may present safety and tolerability issues. Non-electrophilic activation of the Nrf2 pathway via targeting the Bach1 transcriptional repressor provides an alternative mechanism by which to increase the activation of Nrf2 to reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation associated with many acute and chronic diseases.
Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor that controls the expression of certain genes involved in the body’s antioxidant response processes. Genetic knock-out models of Bach1 have shown increased expression of multiple antioxidant proteins such as heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), leading to a significant level of cellular, tissue and organ protection in a wide variety 
Table of Contents

of mouse models. Hemin and the hemin mimetic cobalt protoporphyrin IX (“CoPP”) are Bach1 ligands that have served as useful tool compounds to investigate the role of Bach1 inhibition in a variety of disease settings. Both molecules have been shown to have beneficial effects on oxidative stress and inflammatory-mediated pathologies in several animal models. Further, the ubiquity of the response suggests that the observed tissue protective effects are not related to the underlying causes of a particular disease, but instead are an intrinsic outcome of Bach1 modulation along with Nrf2 activation.
HPP3033
Our candidate, HPP3033, represents a novel, non-electrophilic therapeutic approach to activating the Nrf2 pathway that has the potential to be used in the treatment of chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress. We are currently evaluating HPP3033 and other Nrf2 activator compounds in various preclinical studies.
Partnered Development Programs
PPAR-δ and Reneo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
On December 21, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement with Reneo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Reneo”) (the “Reneo License Agreement”), under which Reneo obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize our peroxisome proliferation activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) agonist program, including the compound HPP593 (REN001), for therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic application in humans.
Under the terms of the Reneo License Agreement, Reneo paid us an initial license fee of $3.0 million. We are eligible to receive additional potential development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments totaling up to $94.5 million. In addition, Reneo is obligated to pay us royalty payments at mid-single to low-double digit rates, based on tiers of annual net sales of licensed products. Such royalties will be payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of expiration of the licensed patents covering a licensed product in a country, expiration of data exclusivity rights for a licensed product in a country or a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country. In addition, we have received common stock and certain participation rights representing a minority interest in Reneo’s outstanding equity.
Under the terms of the Reneo License Agreement, Reneo will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of the licensed products, at its cost, and is required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization efforts.
The Reneo License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue until expiration of all royalty obligations of Reneo to us. Either party may terminate the Reneo License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. Reneo may terminate the Reneo License Agreement at will upon prior written notice.

Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by employees or through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become publicly known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use or incorporate intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our drug candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, mechanism of action, control and predictability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement, and availability of comparable alternative therapies.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement.
Potential Competing Products – Type 1 Diabetes
If approved, we expect that our type 1 diabetes investigational drug candidate will compete with oral non-insulin agents that are currently being developed or which have limited approval in certain jurisdictions. These include SGLT-1/2 inhibitors, such as sotagliflozin, being developed by Lexicon and SGLT-2 inhibitors such as AstraZeneca’s dapagliflozin, both of which are approved for limited use in the European Union and Japan as well as Eli Lilly/Boehringer Ingelheim’s empagliflozin, which is not currently approved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. None of these treatments are approved for treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States.
Collaboration Revenue and Customers
Most of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is related to our licenses of certain compounds in the preclinical stage or clinical stage, including the Cantex License Agreement, Anteris License Agreement, Huadong License Agreement, the Reneo License Agreement, and the Newsoara License Agreement. Revenue recognized in these periods relates to initial consideration received in the form of upfront payments and equity interests, research activities performed by our personnel, and the achievement of development milestones. 
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union (“EU”), extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the
