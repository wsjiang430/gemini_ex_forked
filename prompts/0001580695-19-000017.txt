Item 1. | Business.
----------------------------------+----------

 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to VOIP MDU.com in 2004 and subsequently to VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones.
 
In 2013, Voip-Pal acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited (“Digifonica”), to fund and co-develop Digifonica’s patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications - a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).
 
The Digifonica patents formed the basis for Voip-Pal’s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of issued and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2.1       U.S. Patent No. 8,422,507, issued April 16, 2013, applies, for example, to lawful intercept scenarios in which communications originating in an Internet Protocol (IP) network system from a subscriber to another party occur through a media relay, where information associated with the subscriber profile meets intercept criteria, such that a routing message is produced to cause the media relay to send a copy of the communications to a mediation device.
 
2.2       U.S. Patent No. 9,143,608, issued September 22, 2015, applies, for example, to lawful intercept scenarios in which communications originating in an Internet Protocol (IP) network system from a subscriber to another party occur through a media relay, and where a profile associated with the subscriber includes intercept determination information and destination information indicating where to send monitored communications. For example, when intercept criteria are met, at least some of the intercept determination information and the destination information are included in a routing message.
 
2.3       U.S. Patent No. 9,549,071, issued January 17, 2017, generally relates to, among other things, lawfully intercepting Internet Protocol (IP) communications between a first party and a second party, where a profile associated with the first or second party includes intercept determination information and destination information for one of the first or second party that is to be monitored, the destination information indicating where to send the monitored communications. For example, when an intercept criterion is met, at least some of the intercept determination information and the destination information is included in a routing message.
 
2.4       U.S. Patent No. 10,038,779, issued July 31, 2018, generally relates to lawfully intercepting VoIP or other data communications between a first party and a second party, based on an intercept request message that contains (a) an identification of at least one party whose communications are to be monitored, (b) intercept determination information, and (c) destination information indicating where copies of intercepted communications are to be sent. For example, when an intercept criterion is met, at least some intercept determination information and destination information is included in a routing message.
 
2.5       U.S. Application no. 15/861,572, allowed on August 8, 2018, also relates to lawfully intercepting VoIP or other data communications between parties.
 

3. | Mobile gateway
---+---------------


● | U.S. Patent No. 8,630,234 and Canadian Patent No. 2,732,148 generally relate to, among other things, methods for channeling communications into distributed VoIP gateways (e.g., to allow mobile phones to avoid or minimize long-distance charges while roaming in a geographical area serviced by another cellular provider). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Neither of these patents are currently asserted in litigation. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3.1       U.S. Patent No. 8,630,234, issued January 14, 2014, generally relates to, among other things, a method of roaming with a mobile phone. For example, the mobile phone could receive an access code reply message from the access server that includes a temporary access code allowing the mobile phone to initiate a call to the callee using the access code. In this example, because the call is “local”, the mobile phone can avoid incurring long-distance roaming charges.
 
3.2       Canadian Patent No. 2,732,148, issued April 25, 2018, is directed to, among other things, subject-matter similar to the counterpart U.S. patent (see description above).

4. | Emergency assistance calling
---+-----------------------------


● | U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,537,805 and 9,565,307 generally relate to emergency assistance calling and are applicable, for example, to certain E911 scenarios. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4.1       U.S. Patent No. 8,537,805, issued September 17, 2013, relates to, among other things, handling emergency calls from a caller in a voice over IP (VoIP) system. The ‘805 Patent could apply, for example, when a routing request message is received and the contents of an emergency call identifier field of a profile match the callee identifier. In this example, if the caller identifier is not associated with a pre-associated identifier, a temporary identifier is associated with the caller. When the emergency call flag is active, for example, a routing message establishes a route between the caller and an emergency response center, the routing message including an emergency response center identifier from a profile associated with the caller and the DID identifier associated with the caller.
 
4.2       U.S. Patent No. 9,565,307, issued February 7, 2017, relates to, among other things, routing emergency communications. The ‘307 Patent could apply, for example, when a routing request includes the caller identifier and the callee identifier, and where the caller identifier identifies a profile associated with the caller that includes an emergency call identifier (e.g., “911”) and an emergency response center identifier. In this example, when the callee identifier matches the emergency call identifier, a routing message establishes the call, the routing message having a first portion including the emergency response center identifier and a second portion, which portion may include either a temporary or pre-assigned identifier associated with the caller, for example.
 

5. | Allocating charges
---+-------------------


● | U.S. Patent Nos. 8,774,378 and 9,998,363 both generally relate to allocating charges for communication services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5.1       U.S. Patent No. 8,774,378, issued July 8, 2014, could apply, for example, to scenarios where a communication system operator and a reseller of communication services allocate charges incurred by a user. In this example, the process for attributing charges may involve determining a user cost based on a chargeable time and free time associated with the user, where the chargeable time is based on communication session time and a pre-defined billing pattern—then account balances for the user, reseller and system operator are updated accordingly.
 
5.2       U.S. Patent No. 9,998,363, issued June 12, 2018, relates to, among other things, attributing charges for communications services provided in a communications system for a communication session between a user’s device and a destination device.
 

6. | Determining a time for permitting a communication session
---+----------------------------------------------------------

 
6.1       U.S. Patent No. 9,137,385, issued September 15, 2015, generally relates to, among other things, determining a time for permitting a communication session to be conducted (e.g., a time-to-live or TTL). This patent has not been asserted in litigation.
 
6.2       Canadian App. No. 2,916,217, which also relates to determining a time for permitting a communication session to be conducted (e.g., a time-to-live or TTL), received an indication of allowance August 27, 2018.
 

7. | Uninterrupted transmission during endpoint changes
---+---------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. Patent Nos. 8,675,566; 9,154,417; 10,021,729; European Patent No. 2478678; and Canadian Patent No. 2812174 all generally relate to, among other things, uninterrupted transmission during endpoint changes (e.g., station handoffs). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7.1       U.S. Patent No. 8,675,566, issued March 18, 2014, generally relates to, among other things, uninterrupted transmission of internet protocol (IP) transmissions during endpoint changes.
 
7.2       U.S. Patent No. 9,154,417, issued October 6, 2015, generally relates to, among other things, uninterrupted transmission, where in response to an IP transmission at a media relay, a session information record is processed in a certain manner.
 
7.3       U.S. Patent No. 10,021,729, issued July 10, 2018, generally relates to, among other things, facilitating an uninterrupted internet protocol (IP) communication session, involving internet protocol transmissions between a first entity and a second entity, during endpoint changes.
 
7.4       European Patent No. 2478678 and Canadian Patent No. 2812174 relate to subject matter similar to the aforesaid U.S. patents (see above descriptions).

Amount Spent on Research and Development
 
For the two years ended September 30, 2018, the Company has incurred no research and development expenses.
 
Employees
 
We have one full time employee. The Company utilizes various consultants and contractors for other services.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) and, as such, have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings.
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 

– | Exemptions for “emerging growth companies” from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an “emerging growth company” if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. We will retain “emerging growth company” status until the earliest of:
 

(i) | the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO; 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 

(i) | audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are only required to provide two years of financial statements); 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for “smaller reporting companies” 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
 7

 

The JOBS Act further exempts an “emerging growth company” from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an “emerging growth company” regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the “emerging growth company’s” IPOs.
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” to submit registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow “emerging growth companies” to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an “emerging growth company” nor an “emerging growth company” which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.
 
For so long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” as described above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, as is currently our plan, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.
