ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

 
With respect to this discussion, the terms we us our and the Company refer to Joshua Gold Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation.
 
(a) Corporate History and Background.

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 10, 2009 under the name ABC Acquisition Corp 1501. Prior to the Stock Purchase transaction described below, our business purpose was to seek the acquisition of or merger with, an existing private company. Accordingly, we were engaged in organizational efforts in order to put us in a position where we could seek to target and eventually acquire an existing private company.

On June 4, 2010, Ben Fuschino, our sole officer and director at that time, sold his 35,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock, which shares represented 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock, to Luc Duchesne and Robert Cormier for a total purchase price of $7,000 (the Stock Purchase). Upon closing of the Stock Purchase, (i) Mr. Duchesne and Mr. Cormier held a controlling 100% ownership in the Company, (ii) we changed our business and became a

start-up carbon measuring company and (iii) we changed our name to Bio-Carbon Systems International Inc. to better reflect our new business enterprise. 

Immediately after the closing of the Stock Purchase, on June 4, 2010, we entered into a license agreement (the Cormier License) with R&B Cormier Enterprises Inc. (Cormier Enterprises), an Ontario corporation and a license agreement (the GSN License) with GSN Dreamworks, Inc., an Ontario corporation (GSN). The Cormier License and GSN License (collectively, the License Agreements) granted the Company licensed intellectual property and technology to conduct airborne and other surveys of forested lands in areas that are difficult to access. Those surveys would have been conducted in a statistically verifiable process designed for use in carbon trading programs to assess the potential value of the surveyed lands as carbon sequestration land parcels in carbon trading, carbon sequestration, and other greenhouse gas emission control, offset and reduction programs.

Also, on June 4, 2010, the Company entered into consulting agreements (collectively, the Consulting Agreements) with Mr. Duchesne and Mr. Cormier, pursuant to which Mr. Duchesne and Mr. Cormier agreed to provide the Company with management and advisory services with respect to the intellectual property licensed to the Company under the Cormier and GSN Licenses. 

On December 23, 2010, the Company elected to terminate the License Agreements and Consulting Agreements as the Company determined that conditions were not in place for the successful exploitation of the technology covered by the License Agreements. The termination did not given rise to any penalties against the Company as the termination was concluded through a mutual agreement of separation. 

Upon termination of the aforementioned License and Consulting Agreements, the Company abandoned the carbon measuring business and became a mineral exploration company located in Oakville, Ontario, Canada through the acquisition of a mineral rights lease and other mineral properties, as described in further detail below. The Companys principal business activity now is the exploration of mineral property interests. The Company is considered to be in the exploration stage and substantially all of the Companys efforts are devoted to exploring mineral property interests. There has been no determination whether the Companys interests in unproven mineral properties contain mineral reserves which are economically recoverable. 

On February 1, 2016, the Company registered articles of amendment with the state of Nevada changing the name of the Company from Joshua Gold Resources Inc. to Enhanced Energy Solutions Corp.

On October 18, 2016, the Company registered articles of amendment with the state of Nevada changing the name of the Company from Enhanced Energy Solutions Corp. back to Joshua Gold Resources Inc.

The Company does not have any current plans, arrangements, discussions or intentions, whether written or oral, to engage in a merger or acquisition with an identified or unidentified company or person to be used as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company.
 
We are a development stage company and currently have no revenues. At December 31, 2018, our total current assets were $47,187 and our total current liabilities were $936,570. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $266,955.

Business Overview

We intend to devote substantially all of our efforts on establishing our business plan and continuing to grow our operations in the mineral exploration sector. We do not have sufficient capital to operate our business and will require additional funding to sustain operations through December 2019. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve revenues sufficient to become profitable. Our internet address is www.joshuagoldresources.com.
Employees

 As of February 7, 2019, we had no full-time employees and two part-time employees. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees in the next twelve (12) months.   5    Competition
  We are an exploration stage mineral resource exploration company that competes with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing and for the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact our ability to achieve the financing necessary for us to acquire mineral property interests and conduct exploration activities.   We will also compete with other mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in mineral exploration companies. The presence of competing mineral exploration companies may adversely impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors.   Government Regulation and Standards
 
 There are several governmental regulations that materially restrict the exploration for minerals and the extraction of minerals and any related mining activities in Canada and in the Northwest Territories. The Company will be subject to the mining laws and regulations in force in Canada and in the Northwest Territories (as well as any other jurisdiction wherein a future-acquired property is located). In order to comply with applicable regulations, the Company may be required to obtain work permits, post bonds and perform remediation work for any physical disturbance to land.   Additionally, the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law in July of 2010, includes a requirement for certain companies using conflict minerals in the manufacturing of, or contracting to manufacture, products to publicly disclose the source of the conflict mineral. The conflict mineral list currently includes columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, and gold mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo and several surrounding central African countries. These companies reporting obligations begin with the 2013 calendar year, with the initial reports due in May 2014. The Company currently has no business operations, nor intent to engage in business development activity, within the covered region. The Company is currently focused on development of mineral properties primarily in Canada. However, the Company may incur costs related to its future customers compliance with the law, including, but not limited to: (i) assist future mineral purchase customers by creating and maintaining adequate chain of custody records relating to minerals mined by the Company to establish that they are not conflict minerals, and (ii) provide information to customers for their own conflict mineral reports and audits.  As a general matter, management of the Company will attempt to ensure that all budgets for exploration programs include a contingency for regulatory compliance.  Emerging Growth Company
  We are and we will remain an "emerging growth company" as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).   As an "emerging growth company", we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:  · only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Managements Discussion and Analysis disclosure; · reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; · no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and · exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.  6     We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.  Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a smaller reporting company, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company.  Specifically, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
