Item 1. Business.
Our Company
 
Norris Industries, Inc. (“NRIS” or the “Company”) (formerly International Western Petroleum, Inc.) was incorporated on February 19, 2014, as a Nevada corporation and is headquartered in Weatherford, Texas. The Company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry, and currently focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. On May 4, 2015, the Company initially acquired working interests from the Bend Arch Lion 1A and the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Ventures in Coleman County of Texas, encompassing a total production of 7 producing oil and gas wells on a total of 380 acres out of 777-acre leaseholds indicating proven recoverable reserves. We believed that the Bend Arch Lion 1A and 1B Joint Ventures as parts of the total 777-acre leasehold have not been fully explored. The Company has managed the 45-acre Marshall Walden joint venture with 8 Woodbine Sand oil wells in Kilgore City, Texas, and it acquired a 640 acre leasehold with 3 oil wells (proved undeveloped) from the multi-zone Ratliff property in King County, in an attempt to establish a foothold in the Eastern Permian Basin of Texas. The Company, in fiscal year 2018, also purchased producing oil and gas mineral leases on December 28, 2017, in the Texas counties of Jack County and Palo-Pinto County in North Central Western part of Texas. The leases were for 20 gross oil and gas wells on 2,790 gross acres with majority working and operating interests with daily production of 50+ barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”). Currently, NRIS holds approximately 4,200 total gross acres in leaseholds in various areas of North Central Texas region. The Company plans to focus its limited resources on its existing leaseholds in the future.
 
The Company underwent a change of control in July 2017, when Patrick Norris, and his affiliate JBB Partners (“JBB”) acquired the majority of ownership of the Company and provided loans and equity funding for the oil/gas mineral rights purchases and covering the operational expenses of Company.
 
The Company will, from time to time, seek strategic investors and other funding to help it develop additional exploration and acquisition projects located within the Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin and other prime acquisition targets in the Central West, South and East Texas.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We are an exploration & production (“E&P”) oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. The Company’s goal is to tap into the high potential leases of the Central West Texas region of the United States, aiming to unlock the potential in the prolific Bend Arch-Fort Worth region. This area is approximately 120 miles long and 40 miles wide, running from Archer County, Texas in the north to Brown County, Texas in the south. The Company is also looking at other acquisition opportunities in the Permian Basin, West Texas, East Texas and South Texas region.
 
Management believes that focusing on the development of existing small producing fields is one of the key differentiators of the Company. Oil and natural gas reserve development is a technologically oriented industry. Management believes that the use of current generally available technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success means the ability to make an oil/gas well that produces a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbons. In general, the Company expects to conduct 3D Seismic surveys to determine more accurate drilling locations and drilling depths beside its initial georadiometry technology application via its last 10 drilling projects. For short-term cash flow enhancement, the Company plans to seek large-reserve oil and gas properties with low production to acquire at the lowest cost possible and then implement effective Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) methods to improve its current revenues and assets. For long-term cash flow enhancement, the Company plans to identify larger and more mature production opportunities while selecting capital partners to buyout via the Company’s strategic joint venture partnerships, thus significantly increasing production via additional drilling and state-of-the-art EOR implementations.
 
The Company’s long-term objective is to increase shareholder value by growing reserves, production and cash flow.
 
The Company is currently listed on the OTCQB marketplace of OTC Link as an E&P oil and gas company.

The general strategic objectives of the Company are set forth below.
 
Develop and Grow Our Hydrocarbon Acreage Positions Using Outside Development Expertise. We plan to focus on improving our assets that are located in hydrocarbon-rich resource plays to improve our asset quality and to improve on production. We plan to leverage outside expertise to apply available EOR technologies to economically develop our existing property portfolio and those that we may acquire in the future. We operate the majority of our acreage, thus giving us certain control over the planning of capital expenditures, execution and cost reduction. Our operations also allow us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. Our leasehold acquisition strategy is to pursue long-term contracts that allow us to maintain flexible development plans and avoid short-term obligations to drill wells, as have been common in other resource plays. As a small producer, we regularly evaluate industry drilling results and implement technologically effective operating practices which may increase our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital.
 
Manage Our Property Portfolio Proactively. We evaluate our properties to identify and divest non-core assets and higher cost or lower volume producing properties with limited developmental potential, to enable us to focus on a portfolio of core properties with what we believe to be the greatest economic potential to increase our proved reserves and production.
 
Acquire Small Producing Companies with Compelling Underlying Values. We review acquisition opportunities with underlying assets to evaluate their development potential and accelerate production to unlock their potential value.
 
Maintain Positive Equity Balance Sheet to Execute Our Growth Plan. Our management team is focused on maintaining a positive asset balance sheet since this gives it the ability to increase borrowing capacity and access to capital markets and to provide us with a liquidity level to execute continued growth in assets and revenues.
 
Our operation strategy is to identify niche hydrocarbon land leases in Texas with in-depth studies and develop proven reserves via drilling new wells and re-entering existing low production wells to maximize production and enhance valuation of our production assets.
 
Based upon management’s and its use of outside petroleum exploration experience, geology expertise, and ability to identify potential acreage and moderate production fields, management believes that the Company’s future valuation as a public company is speculative but could become attractive if and when we increase our production successfully.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Management believes that there are a number of competitive strengths that would allow us to successfully execute our business strategies:
 
Simple Capital Structure. We have a simple capital structure and de-risked inventory of locations with what we believe is upside potential to take advantage of the continuing recovery of oil prices to acquire potential production at reasonable cost. Management believes there are opportunities for profits to be made now that oil prices appear to have stabilized and if they continue to gradually rise higher.
 
Management Team. With selected experience in key aspects of the development of resource plays, our management team and its consultants have decades of combined experience in the industry and a commitment to create shareholder value via an acquisition strategy. We also consult and work with geologists, engineers, and other professionals to execute on our business objectives.
 
Moderate Risk Exploration Practice. Unlike many major oil companies that often drill very deep wells with a high degree of risk, we focus on shallow well exploration (sub 5,000 feet) that is less expensive and has lower risk factors. The basis for management’s belief that the wells that can be drilled in the prospective leases will have the capacity to produce a reasonable amount of hydrocarbon and due to our recent studies of the general areas where we are prospecting the projects. That is our most important exploration practice.

Under The Radar Asset Base. Management believes it can acquire, from time to time, hydrocarbon land leases with sub-300 barrels of oil per day (“bopd”) wells that have large hydrocarbon reserves that have been overlooked by other oil and gas operators. Management believes that these “under the radar” prospective leases have multi-year drilling inventory and reasonable production history with high upside potential and not readily accessible to the public for auctions, thus adding to our competitive advantage on these “under the radar” opportunities. Management also believes that these highly valuable leases are not economically justifiable for the major oil and gas companies in the region because such companies need wells that produce at least 300 barrels (“Bbls”) of oil per day per well to meet their business model and operating costs.
 
Geographic Diversity. We believe that our geographic diversity encompassing the West, Central West, East and South Texas regions provides us with some flexibility to direct our capital resources to projects with the greatest potential returns and access to multiple key end markets, which mitigates our exposure to temporary price dislocations in any one market.
 
Technologies
 
Oil and natural gas reserve development is a technologically oriented industry. Management believes that technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercially viable oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success rate means the ability to make an oil/gas well that can produce a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbon.
 
At NRIS, we engage consultants to focus on geoscience along with help in our understanding of complex mineralogy in shale reservoirs and better determining zones prone to enhance production. This technology strongly suggests where to frack by providing us with rapidly available data while delivering game changing levels of collaboration: multi-well, multi-user and multi interpreter. Our field engineers, geologists and petrophysicists work together for better drilling decisions.
 
Reservoir Estimate
 
As of March 1, 2019, our estimated gross proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Bryant M. Mook, PE, using SEC prices of $63.43 per Bbl of oil and $3.04 per Mcf of natural gas, increased to 120 MBbl of oil and 1,536 MMcf of natural gas. As result of lease purchases from funding made available from our majority owner, we include 100% of our net oil reserves and 100% of our net natural gas reserves that were classified as proved producing that include values from the proved not producing (“PDNP”), and for its Proved Undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves categories as of March 1, 2019.
Sales Strategy
 
Our sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price is higher. To maintain the lowest production cost, we will aim to have our inventory be as low as possible, in some instances virtually zero. Our E&P core team has business relationships with BML, Transport Oil, and Lion Oil Trading & Transportation, for oil sales and WTG Jameson for gas sales. The Company entered into production agreements with BML, Lion Oil and WTG Jameson so that, as our tier 1 buyer, they can handle pick-up and sales of our crude oil stock to refineries and gas via local gas pipelines.
 
As such, crude oil will be picked up from our leases as needed during the calendar month. At the end of the month the crude total sales will be tallied by lease and the 30-day average of the daily closing of oil will be tabulated. On or about the 25th of the following month the proceeds checks’ will be issued to the financial parties of record.
 
Operational Plans
 
During fiscal year 2019, the Company was in a period of assessment and work-over of its existing wells as result of its acquisition of the Jack and Palo Pinto oil and gas leases, completed on December 28, 2017. During the 2020 fiscal year, we are looking for, on a selective basis, oil and gas reserve concessions with existing production. We intend to seek to raise enough capital via equity or debt financing options to meet our operational goals in fiscal year 2020, be this from our control owner, or other third-party financing sources, including the capital markets.

Based on the Company’s general management and petroleum exploration experience, as well as its geology expertise, the Company believes it has the ability to identify potential acreage with existing producing fields and acquire them.
 
The Company has adjusted its E&P plan to a focus on acquisitions and production opportunities in the North Texas and Permian Basin region. This region has been producing oil continuously for nearly 100 years and the U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) has recently announced that this region has the largest estimate of continuous oil production that it has ever assessed. Our area of interest is production locations in Texas but may include unique opportunities outside of the Texas Permian Basin market where property prices are too high for the smaller players as a result of USGS estimates that there are 20 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil.
 
The Company has an acquisition model which is based on a concept that has been proven in the past to be an effective and successful path of development for many other well- known E&P players:
 

a) | the financed acquisition of mature smaller oil fields that have potential for instituting EOR incremental production processes; and 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | Develop strategic partnerships with existing operators to share production increases garnered through the implementation of this EOR plan. 

 
After identifying a new prospect, additional research and evaluation was carried out using our personal contacts, geologists, 3D seismic, satellite hydrocarbon imaging, production data and other available resources to glean information and data in order to make an acquisition decision. Our operational plan after an acquisition is to increase production of the acquired oil and gas properties using current technologies with a designated budget pre-approved by the Company’s senior management team. The Company plans to implement cost saving measures in operating budgets for each exploration project, but each budget will vary depending on the total depth of drilling and whether it is a new drilling or a re-entry. For each project, the Company plans on hiring selected operators to work under the close supervision of a core team of Company geologists, engineers and scientists.
 
The exploration and production process is a two-phase process: 1) drilling and testing and 2) well completion. The Company plans to hire drilling specialists and technical consultants designated to oversee the drilling and reentering of existing holes for each well during the drilling and testing phase. For the well completion process, the Company plans to hire technical data collectors and cementing operators to ensure the best performance upon perforating the wells at different pay zones based on thorough technical advisory work done by our internal and external production personnel and geologists before production.
 
The Company also applies selective leading edge EOR technologies from technology vendors to improve existing production after each future acquisition.
 
Completed Acquisitions with Production Enhancement Programs
 
To date, the Company has prospected and completed several exploration and acquisition projects:
 
The Bend Arch Lion 1A JV, Coleman County, TX:
 
This drilling joint venture is a 160-acre leasehold having four producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner International Western Oil. This field has been surveyed with high quality proven reserves encompassing several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand, the Palo Pinto, and in some instances the Ellenburger pay zone. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 39.5% working interest from IWO in the Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch White property encompassing 160 acres – State ID# 21488) (the “1A Venture”.) By acquiring these working interests, the Company directly receives the share of working interest revenue (after accounting for applicable taxes, expenses, and landowner royalties) IWO was receiving prior to the acquisitions.

-


As of February 28, 2019, the 1A Venture property had four (4) gross oil and gas wells (1.58 net wells). The initial production of this property started in April 2014.
 
Management plans to review and determine how best to implement a production improvement program on several of its wells including the Bend Arch Lion 1A and others. As a result of recent studies that show accessible proven reserves in several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand and the Ellenburger pay zones, management believes its production improvement program can offer an increase from the current production of these fields by re-completing certain pay zones with either standard acidizing jobs, a new EOR method, or reentering and fixing equipment in areas that have become declining wellbores.
 
The Bend Arch Lion 1B JV, Coleman County, TX:
 
This drilling joint venture is a 220-acre leasehold having 6 new producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner International Western Oil. In May 2015, the Company acquired working interests of this leasehold which has been surveyed with high quality proven reserves encompassing several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand and in some instances the Ellenburger pay zone. At the moment, the leasehold has 3 producing wells coming from the Gray Sand formation and 3 producing wells coming from the Ellenberger formation. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired 46% working interest in the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch Red property encompassing 220 acres - State ID# 13121) (the “1B Venture”).
 
As of February 28, 2019, the 1B Venture property had six (6) gross oil and gas wells (3 net wells). The initial production of this property started in March 2015.
 
Management plans to determine how best to implement a production improvement program on the Bend Arch Lion 1B as the result of our prior in-depth studies that show accessible proven reserves in several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand pay zone and the Ellenburger pay zone. Management believes this can offer a potential increase from the current production of this field by re-completing certain Gray Sand pay zone with either standard acidizing jobs or a new EOR method, and entering the virgin Gray Sand pay zone or increasing pumping efficiency in the Ellenburger pay zone in certain declining wellbores.
 
The Marshall Walden JV, Kilgore City, TX:
 
As of July 29, 2016, the Company served as the managing venturer in a 45-acre joint venture with Odyssey Enterprises LLC which has financed the Marshall Walden joint venture for the lease purchase and optimization of wells located in Kilgore, Texas, in the heart of the Woodbine formation. There are 8 wellbores in the acquisition, with 4 currently in production and 4 inactive. During the year ended February 28, 2018, the Company completed a re-work of several inactive wellbores and plans to upgrade to a new pump set up to enhance oil production levels. Management believes that this Marshall Walden acquisition put a solid foundation in place for the Company in the East Texas region.
 
As of February 28, 2019, the Marshall Walden property had six (6) gross oil and gas wells (0.6 net wells) which are intermittently active, plus two (2) injection wells. There are no definitive plans currently; the Company expects to determine such in the next fiscal year. The initial production of this property started in September 2016.
 
The Ratliff Property, King County, TX:
 
As of December 6, 2016, the Company acquired, in a series of payments that totaled $100,000, a 640 acres oil and gas lease and also 3D Seismic data for 340-acres of the leasehold acreage acquired in King County, Texas. This acquisition represented a 100% working interest with 70% net revenue interest on leasehold acreages in King County, Texas, with additional options to lease up to 800 acres of adjoining acreage with 3D seismic data. The 640-acre leasehold comes with an existing tank facility for the production of oil, natural gas, and water. There is also a full injection wellbore set in place that is equipped. There have been five (5) wellbores drilled on this lease dating back to the 1970s, and these previous wellbores ranged from 4800ft – 6200ft in total depth, with three (3) different prolific hydrocarbon formations.

Management believes that this acquisition created an initial small foothold for us in the Eastern Permian Basin. Within depth studying of the 3D seismic data, we believe there are up to eight (8) proven undeveloped locations (“PUDs”) throughout the lease’s acreage. Management also believes that the Company can best take full advantage of the complete 3D Seismic data available and should be able to drill wellbores in favorable locations. The Company plans to develop a workover plan on existing oil and gas wells that are producers via extended re-entry method before the end of fiscal year 2020. As of February 28, 2019, the Ratliff property had minimal production but had value in several proved developed not producing (“PDNP”) wells based on the Company’s year-end reserve analysis.
 
The Stuart Leases of Jack County and Palo-Pinto County
 
The Jack County and Palo-Pinto County Stuart oil leases were purchased on December 28, 2017 for $1,600,000 in cash and have twenty (20) gross oil and gas wells (15 net wells) which the management is operating production on its properties.
 
The data below is based on the SEC Non-Escalated Analysis of Estimated Proved Reserve of the Jack County and Palo Pinto County associated leases as well as the Bend Arch Lion 1A and Bend Arch Lion 1B, and Marshall-Walden leaseholds in which the Company has certain minority interests. As of March 1, 2019, this evaluation report was prepared by an independent third-party Bryant M. Mook, a double PE reservoir engineer based in Houston, Texas. In order to include portions of the PDNP from the reserves report, the Company has secured assurances from its majority owner to do a review and to fund selectively up to the $250,000 maximum cost indicated in such reserve report to be able to increase its current production rates. The Company will concentrate on those wells in which the Company either owns a majority, or 100% of the working interest in such oil and gas property lease.
