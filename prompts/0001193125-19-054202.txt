 Disclosure of reserves 
 Summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end
The table below summarizes the net proved reserves for the company, as at December 31, 2018, as detailed in the Supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities part of the Financial section, starting on page 34 of this report. 
 All of the companys reported reserves are located in Canada. The company has reported proved reserves based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period ending December 31. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. No major discovery or other favourable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2018 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date. 

 | Liquids (a) | | Natural gas | | Synthetic oil | Bitumen | Total oil-equivalentbasis |

Total net proved | | 62 | | 639 | | 466 | | 3,166 | 3,800


(a) | Liquids include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). NGL proved reserves are not material and are therefore included under liquids.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the company only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors, including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty framework and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the companys capital spending and also impact its partners capacity to fund their share of joint projects. The companys operating decisions and its outlook for future production volumes are not impacted by proved reserves as disclosed under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definition. 
 As a result of improved prices during 2018, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, an additional 2.3 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl qualified as proved reserves at year-end 2018. 
 Technologies used in establishing proved reserves estimates 
 Imperials proved reserves in 2018 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. 
 Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages. 
 In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
 
5 


 Preparation of reserves estimates 
 Imperial has a dedicated reserves management group that is separate from the base operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of Imperials proved reserves. This group also maintains the official reserves estimates for Imperials proved reserves. In addition, this group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting processes within Imperial. 
 The reserves management group maintains a central database containing the companys official reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the systems controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance, and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to reserves estimates in the central database, including the addition of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless those changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the base operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and endorsement by the operating organization and the reserves management group, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the companys board of directors. 
 The internal qualified reserves evaluator is a professional geoscientist registered in Alberta, Canada and has over 20 years of petroleum industry experience, including 14 years of reserves related experience. The position provides leadership to the internal reserves management group and is responsible for filing a reserves report with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The companys internal reserves evaluation staff consists of 40 persons with an average of 13 years of relevant technical experience in evaluating reserves, of whom 20 persons are qualified reserves evaluators for purposes of Canadian securities regulatory requirements. The companys internal reserves evaluation management team is made up of 17 persons with an average of 13 years of relevant experience in evaluating and managing the evaluation of reserves. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves 
 As at December 31, 2018, approximately 11 percent of the companys proved reserves were proved undeveloped reflecting volumes of 404 million oil-equivalent barrels. Proved undeveloped reserves are associated with Cold Lake and the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. This compared to 450 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2017. The decrease of 46 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves includes 63 million oil-equivalent barrels at Cold Lake and conventional assets, partially offset by an increase of 17 million oil-equivalent barrels at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. Conversion of proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed was 22 million oil-equivalent barrels in 2018, associated with conventional, and Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more represent about 71 percent (285 million oil-equivalent barrels) of proved undeveloped reserves and are associated with ongoing drilling programs at Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets and at Cold Lake. These undeveloped reserves are planned to be developed in a staged approach to align with operational capacity and efficient capital spending commitment over the life of the assets. The company is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty framework and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. 
 One of the companys requirements to report resources as proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments towards the development of the reserves. The company has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long lead-time in order to be developed. The company made investments of about $391 million during the year to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves in its Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets and at Cold Lake. These investments represented about 40 percent of the $991 million in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

Canadian dollars per thousand cubic feet | | | 
Natural gas | 2.43 | 2.58 | 2.41 


(a) | Liquids include crude oil, condensate and NGLs.
----+------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, Imperials average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen declined generally in line with Western Canada Select, adjusted for changes in the exchange rate and transportation costs. The companys average Canadian dollar realizations for synthetic crude increased, however the widening of the western Canadian light crude differential relative to West Texas Intermediate during the fourth quarter of 2018 negatively impacted synthetic crude realizations. 
 In 2017, Imperials average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen and synthetic crudes increased generally in line with the North American benchmarks, adjusted for changes in the exchange rate and transportation costs. 
 Average unit production costs 
 

Canadian dollars per barrel | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Bitumen | 29.39 | 26.81 | 24.24
Synthetic oil | 60.34 | 58.96 | 46.24
Total oil-equivalent basis (a) | 35.28 | 32.96 | 28.52


(a) | Includes liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas.
----+----------------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, bitumen unit production costs were higher, primarily driven by Kearl costs associated with improving reliability, partly offset by the impact of higher production. 
 In 2018, synthetic oil unit production costs were higher, primarily driven by higher maintenance costs, including impacts of the June 20 site-wide power disruption. 
 In 2017, synthetic oil unit production costs were higher, primarily driven by impacts of the fire at the Syncrude Mildred Lake upgrader.

 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources 
 Cold Lake 
 To maintain production at Cold Lake, capital expenditures for additional production wells and associated facilities are required periodically. Additional wells were drilled on existing phases in 2018. 
 The company also conducts experimental pilot operations to improve recovery of bitumen from wells by means of new drilling, production or recovery techniques. 
 Aspen, Cold Lake expansion and other oil sands activities 
 The company filed a regulatory application for a new in-situ oil sands project at Aspen in December 2013, using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology to develop the project in three phases producing about 45,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. In 2015, the company amended the regulatory application to develop the Aspen project using solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) technology. The technology significantly improves capital efficiency and lowers greenhouse gas intensity versus the existing SAGD technologies. The project is proposed to be executed in two phases producing about 75,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. 
 In October 2018, regulatory approval for the Aspen in-situ project was received from the Alberta Energy Regulator. The first phase of the project was approved by the companys board and appropriated for $2.6 billion. Construction began late in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 In March 2016, Imperial filed a regulatory application for the Cold Lake expansion project to develop the Grand Rapids interval using SA-SAGD technology. The project is proposed to produce 50,000 barrels per day, before royalties. In August 2018, regulatory approval for the Cold Lake expansion project was received from the Alberta Energy Regulator. The regulatory approval is currently being reviewed. No final investment decisions have been made at this time.

 Work continues on technical evaluations to support potential Corner, Clyden and Chard in-situ development regulatory applications. 
 The company also has interests in other oil sands leases in the Athabasca and Peace River areas of northern Alberta. Evaluation wells completed on these leased areas established the presence of bitumen. The company continues to evaluate these leases to determine their potential for future development. 
 Montney and Duvernay 
 The company is continuing to evaluate, develop and produce resources in its Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets in the western provinces. 
 Beaufort Sea 
 In 2007, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in an exploration licence in the Beaufort Sea. As part of the evaluation, a 3-D seismic survey was conducted in 2008 and the company has since carried out data collection programs to support environmental studies and safe exploration drilling operations. 
 In 2010, the company executed an agreement to cross-convey interests with another company to acquire a 25 percent interest in an additional Beaufort Sea exploration licence. As a result of that agreement, the company operates both licences and its interest in the original licence was reduced to 25 percent. The exploration licences are held through 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
 In 2013, the company and its joint venture partners filed a project description, initiating the formal regulatory review of the project. 
 In December 2016, the Federal Government of Canada declared Arctic waters off limits to new offshore oil and gas licences for five years subject to review at the end of that period. Existing licences will not be impacted. The Federal Government continues to consult with existing leaseholders. Current activities continue to focus on community consultation and progressing legislative changes to extend the life of existing licences. The company continues to evaluate the licences. 
 Liquefied natural gas (LNG) activity 
 WCC LNG Ltd., jointly owned by the company (20 percent) and ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. (80 percent), was granted an export licence in 2013 for up to 30 million tonnes of LNG per year for a period of 25 years. In 2016, the licence period was extended to 40 years. In December, 2018, after careful review, Imperial and ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. withdrew the WCC LNG project from the British Columbia environmental assessment process. 
 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining methods 
 The company continues to evaluate other undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region.

 Present activities 
 Review of principal ongoing activities 
 Cold Lake 
 Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to the companys refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. 
 During 2018, net production at Cold Lake was about 120,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 147,000 barrels per day. 
 Kearl 
 Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, which is processed through extraction and froth treatment trains. The company holds a 70.96 percent participating interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to the companys refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 During 2018, the companys share of Kearls net bitumen production was about 135,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 146,000 barrels per day. Increased 2018 production reflects improved operational reliability associated with ore preparation, enhanced piping durability and feed management. 
 Imperial continues to progress work to increase Kearl annual average production to 240,000 barrels of bitumen per day (Imperials gross share would be about 170,000 barrels of bitumen per day), through planned investment including supplemental crushing capacity and flow distribution interconnects to enhance reliability, increase redundancy and reduce downtime. The work is expected to be complete by year-end 2019. 
 Syncrude 
 Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The company holds a 25 percent participating interest in the joint venture. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped to the companys refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 In 2018, the companys share of Syncrudes net production of synthetic crude oil was about 60,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 62,000 barrels per day. 
 The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production. Royalties are subject to the oil sands royalty regulations which are based upon a sliding scale determined largely by the price of crude oil. 
  Delivery commitments 
 The company has no material commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil or gas under existing contracts and agreements.

 Western provinces 
 The companys bitumen leases include about 194,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of about 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The company also has about 69,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totaling about 177,000 net acres, which include about 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area, about 34,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Aspen area, about 30,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Corner area and about 18,000 net acres in the Chard area. These 177,000 net acres are suitable for in-situ recovery techniques. 
 The companys share of Syncrude joint venture leases covering about 63,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic oil acreage. 
 
12 


 Oil sands leases have an exploration period of 15 years and are continued beyond that point by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, by payment of escalating rentals, or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production. 
 The company holds interests in an additional 1,167,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in the western provinces related to crude oil and natural gas. 
 Crude oil and natural gas leases and licences from the western provinces have exploration periods ranging from two to 15 years and are continued beyond that point by proven production capability. 
 Canada lands 
 Land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration licence (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of about 252,000 net acres and significant discovery licence (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea areas of about 183,000 net acres. 
 Exploration licences on Canada lands and Atlantic offshore have a finite term. If a significant discovery is made, a SDL may be granted that holds the acreage under the SDL indefinitely, subject to certain conditions. 
 The companys net acreage in Canada lands is either continued by production or held through ELs and SDLs. 
 Atlantic offshore 
 The Atlantic offshore acreage is continued by production or held by SDLs.

 Downstream 
 Supply 
 The company supplements its own production of crude oil, condensate and petroleum products with substantial purchases from a number of other sources at negotiated market prices. Purchases are made under both spot and term contracts from domestic and foreign sources, including ExxonMobil. 
Transportation 
 Imperial currently transports the companys crude oil production and third party crude oil required to supply refineries by contracted pipelines, common carrier pipelines and rail. To mitigate uncertainty associated with the timing of industry pipeline projects and pipeline capacity constraints, the company has developed rail infrastructure. The Edmonton rail terminal has total capacity to ship up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. 
Refining 
 The company owns and operates three refineries, which process predominantly Canadian crude oil. In 2017, Imperial decided to discontinue manufacturing base stocks, associated waxes and finished lubricants at its Strathcona Refinery lube complex and lube oil blend plant. Operations continued at the blend plant until mid-2018. In addition to crude oil, the company purchases finished products to supplement its refinery production. 
 The approximate average daily volumes of refinery throughput during the three years ended December 31, 2018, and the daily rated capacities of the refineries as at December 31, 2018, were as follows. 
 

 | Refinery throughput (a) | | Rated capacities (b)
 | Year ended December 31 | | at December 31 
thousands of barrels per day | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2018
Strathcona, Alberta | | 173 | | 185 | | 168 | 191
Sarnia, Ontario | | 109 | | 103 | | 108 | 119
Nanticoke, Ontario | | 110 | | 95 | | 86 | 113
Total | | 392 | | 383 | | 362 | 423


(a) | Refinery throughput is the volume of crude oil and feedstocks that is processed in the refinery atmospheric distillation units.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Rated capacities are based on definite specifications as to types of crude oil and feedstocks that are processed in the refinery atmospheric distillation units, the products to be obtained and the refinery process, adjusted to include an estimated allowance for normal maintenance shutdowns. Accordingly, actual capacities may be higher or lower than rated capacities due to changes in refinery operation and the type of crude oil available for processing.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Refinery throughput averaged 392,000 barrels per day in 2018, up from 383,000 barrels per day in 2017. Capacity utilization increased to 93 percent from 91 percent in 2017. 
 Refinery throughput averaged 383,000 barrels per day in 2017, up from 362,000 barrels per day in 2016. Capacity utilization increased to 91 percent from 86 percent in 2016, reflecting reduced turnaround maintenance activity. 
 Distribution 
 The company maintains a nationwide distribution system, to move petroleum products to market by pipeline, tanker, rail and road transport. The company owns and operates natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and has interests in the capital stock of one crude oil and two products pipeline companies.

 Marketing 
 The company markets petroleum products throughout Canada under well-known brand names, most notably Esso and Mobil, to all types of customers. 
 Imperial supplies petroleum products to the motoring public through Esso and Mobil-branded sites and independent marketers. At the end of 2018, there were about 2,200 sites operating under a branded wholesaler model whereby Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties who own and operate sites in alignment with Esso and Mobil brand standards. The Mobil fuels brand was launched in Canada in 2017 with the conversion of more than 200 existing unbranded third party sites completed by the end of 2018. 
 Imperial also sells petroleum products, including fuel, asphalt and lubricants, to large industrial and transportation customers, independent marketers, resellers, as well as other refiners. The company serves agriculture, residential heating and commercial markets through branded fuel and lubricant resellers. 
 The approximate daily volumes of net petroleum products (excluding purchases / sales contracts with the same counterparty) sold during the three years ended December 31, 2018, are set out in the following table. 
 

thousands of barrels per day | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Gasolines | | 255 | | 257 | | 261
Heating, diesel and jet fuels | | 183 | | 177 | | 170
Heavy fuel oils (a) | | 26 | | 18 | | 16 
Lube oils and other products | | 40 | | 40 | | 37 
Net petroleum product sales (a) | | 504 | | 492 | | 484


(a) | In 2018 and 2017, carbon black product sales are reported under Net petroleum product sales  Heavy fuel oils; in 2016, they were reported under Total petrochemical sales  Polymers and basic chemicals.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, sales growth continued to be driven by optimization across the full downstream value chain, and the expansion of Imperials logistic capabilities. 
 Chemical 
 The companys Chemical operations manufacture and market benzene, aromatic and aliphatic solvents, plasticizer intermediates and polyethylene resin. Its petrochemical and polyethylene manufacturing operations are located in Sarnia, Ontario, adjacent to the companys petroleum refinery. 
 The companys total petrochemical sales volumes during the three years ended December 31, 2018, were as follows. 
 

thousands of tonnes | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Total petrochemical sales (a) | | 807 | | 774 | | 908


(a) | In 2018 and 2017, carbon black product sales are reported under Net petroleum product sales  Heavy fuel oils; in 2016, they were reported under Total petrochemical sales  Polymers and basic chemicals.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, sales volumes were higher primarily due to higher production in polymers and basic chemicals, driven by stronger reliability. 
 Lower sales volumes in 2017 were primarily due to the reclassification of carbon black product sales.

 Environmental protection 
 The company regards protecting the environment in connection with its various operations as a priority. The company works in cooperation with government agencies, industry associations and communities to address existing, and to anticipate potential, environmental protection issues. In the past five years, the company has made capital and operating expenditures of about $4.8 billion on environmental protection and facilities. In 2018, the companys environmental capital and operating expenditures totalled approximately $0.6 billion, which was spent primarily on activities to protect the air, land and water, including remediation projects. Capital and operating expenditures relating to environmental protection are expected to be about $0.7 billion in 2019. 
 Human resources 
 

career employees (a) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Total | | 5,700 | | 5,400 | | 5,600


(a) | Rounded. Career employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical, administrative and wage employees who work full time or part time for the company and are covered by the companys benefit plans.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 About 6 percent of the companys employees are members of unions. 
 Competition 
 The Canadian energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. Competition exists in the search for and development of new sources of supply, the construction and operation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products pipelines and facilities and the refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum products and chemicals. The energy and petrochemical industries also compete with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers.

 Government regulation 
 Petroleum and natural gas rights 
 Most of the companys petroleum and natural gas rights were acquired from governments, either federal or provincial. These rights, in the form of leases or licences, are generally acquired for cash or work commitments. A lease or licence entitles the holder to explore for petroleum and / or natural gas on the leased lands for a specified period. 
 In western provinces, the lease holder can produce the petroleum or natural gas discovered on the leased lands and retains the rights based on continued production. Oil sands leases are retained by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. 
 The holder of a licence relating to Canada lands and the Atlantic offshore can apply for a SDL if a discovery is made. If granted, the SDL holds the lands indefinitely subject to certain conditions. The holder may then apply for a production licence in order to produce petroleum or natural gas from the licenced land. 
 Project approval 
 Approvals and licences from relevant provincial or federal governmental or regulatory bodies are required for the company to carry out, or make modifications to, its oil and gas activities. The project approval process for major projects can involve, among other things, environmental assessments (including relevant mitigation measures), stakeholder and Indigenous consultation and input regarding project concerns, and public hearings. Approval may be subject to various conditions and commitments arising through these processes. 
 Crude oil 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of crude oil from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities on the basis of engineering and conservation principles. 
 Additionally, in December 2018, the Government of Alberta introduced temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations, which took effect on January 1, 2019. These regulations impose production limits on large producers in Alberta. The duration and impact of these regulations is uncertain. 
 Exports 
 Export contracts of more than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require the prior approval of the National Energy Board (NEB) and the Government of Canada. Export contracts of less than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require an order from the NEB. 
 Natural gas 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of natural gas from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities. These limitations are to ensure oil recovery is not adversely impacted by accelerated gas production practices. These limitations do not impact gas reserves, only the timing of production of the reserves and did not have a significant impact on Imperials 2018 gas production rates. 
Exports 
 The Government of Canada has the authority to regulate the export price for natural gas and has a gas export pricing policy, which accommodates export prices for natural gas negotiated between Canadian exporters and U.S. importers. 
 Exports of natural gas from Canada require approval by the NEB and the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada allows the export of natural gas by NEB order without volume limitation for terms not exceeding 24 months.

 Royalties 
 The Government of Canada and the provinces in which the company produces crude oil and natural gas, impose royalties on production from lands where they own the mineral rights. Some producing provinces also receive revenue by imposing taxes on production from lands where they do not own the mineral rights. 
 Different royalties are imposed by the Government of Canada and each of the producing provinces. Royalties imposed on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids vary depending on a number of parameters, including well production volumes, selling prices and recovery methods. For information with respect to royalties for Cold Lake, Syncrude and Kearl, see Upstream section entitled Present activities under Item 1 on page 11. 
 Investment Canada Act 
 The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. The acquisition of natural resource properties may, in certain circumstances, be considered a transaction that constitutes an acquisition of control of a Canadian business requiring Government of Canada approval. 
 The Act also requires notification of the establishment of new unrelated businesses in Canada by entities not controlled by Canadians, but does not require Government of Canada approval except when the new business is related to Canadas cultural heritage or national identity. The Government of Canada is also authorized to take any measures that it considers advisable to protect national security, including the outright prohibition of a foreign investment in Canada. By virtue of the majority stock ownership of the company by ExxonMobil, the company is considered to be an entity which is not controlled by Canadians. 
 Competition Act 
 The Competition Bureau ensures that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace. The Competition Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act (the Act). A merger transaction, whether or not notifiable, is subject to examination by the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau to determine whether the merger will have, or is likely to have, the effect of preventing or lessening substantially competition in a definable market. The assessment of the competitive effects of a merger is made with reference to the factors identified under the Act. 
 An Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC) may be issued by the Commissioner to a party or parties to a proposed merger transaction who want to be assured that the transaction will not give rise to proceedings under section 92 of the Act. Section 102 of the Act provides that an ARC may be issued when the Commissioner is satisfied that there would not be sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order against a proposed merger. The issuance of an ARC is discretionary. An ARC cannot be issued for a transaction that has been completed, nor does an ARC ensure approval of the transaction by any agency other than the Competition Bureau.
