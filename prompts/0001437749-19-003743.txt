Item 1.  Business
General

IKONICS Corporation (“IKONICS” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Minnesota as Chroma-Glo, Inc. in 1952 and changed its name to The Chromaline Corporation in 1982.  In December 2002, the Company changed its name to IKONICS Corporation.  The Company’s three traditional businesses, Domestic, IKONICS Imaging and Export, have been the development, manufacture and selling of photosensitive liquids (“emulsions”) and films for the screen printing,  awards and recognition industries and dye sublimation markets.  These sales have been augmented with inkjet receptive films, ancillary chemicals and related equipment to provide a full line of products and services to its customers. These products are sold worldwide primarily through distributors.  The Company further diversified itself by expanding its business to industrial markets. These efforts now include the Company’s Advanced Material Solutions (“AMS”) business unit which uses the Company’s proprietary processes and photoresist film for the abrasive etching of composite materials, industrial ceramics, silicon wafers, and glass wafers.  The customer base for AMS is primarily the aerospace and electronics industries.  Based on its expertise in ultraviolet curable fluids and inkjet receptive substrates, the Company has also developed a patented digital texturing technology (“DTX”) for putting patterns and textures into steel molds for the plastic injection molding industry. The original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) for the Company’s DTX technology is primarily the automotive industry. The Company offers a suite of products to the mold making industry.  Industrial inkjet printers, which are integral to the DTX system, are manufactured by a third party and sold by IKONICS.  The Company’s business plan is to sell consumable fluids and transfer films.  For most markets, these sales are direct to the mold maker.  The DTX technology is also utilized in prototyping where the Company’s technology offers a unique combination of high definition, large format prints, and abrasion resistance.
Products

The Company has four primary technology platforms: ultraviolet (UV) chemistry, film coating and construction, technical abrasive etching, and industrial inkjet printing. The Company’s traditional products and new initiatives are based on these platforms and their combinations. The Company’s Chromaline branded products for the screen printing industry and IKONICS Imaging products for the awards and recognition market are based on UV chemistry and film coating and construction capabilities; the AMS offering is a combination of UV chemistry, film coating and construction and technical abrasive etching capabilities; DTX is a combination of UV chemistry, film coating and construction, and industrial inkjet printing.  There is overlap and synergy in the market between the Domestic, Ikonics Imaging, AMS and DTX product offerings, and the Company offers ancillary products, including equipment to provide customers with a total solution.  The Company considers this combination of core technologies and product offerings to be unique.
Distribution and Customers

The Company currently has approximately 200 domestic and international distributors for its Chromaline and ImageMate screen printing emulsions and films.  The Company’s abrasive etching products are mainly sold directly to end users in the awards and recognition market under the Ikonics Imaging brand. AMS products are sold either directly to users or the Company offers AMS as a service. DTX includes the sales of consumable inks and films to customers that have purchased specialized industrial inkjet printers from the Company’s strategic partner. DTX sales are primarily direct to end users. The Company markets and sells its products through magazine advertising, trade shows and the internet.
 
The Company has a diverse customer base both domestically and abroad, with international sales accounting for 29.4% of total sales in 2018 and 30.5% of total sales in 2017, and does not depend on one or a few customers for a material portion of its revenues.  In 2018 and 2017, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
 
Quality Control in Manufacturing

In March 1994, IKONICS became the first company in northern Minnesota to receive ISO 9001 certification.  ISO 9000 is a worldwide standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization that provides a framework for quality assurance.  The Company has been recertified every three years beginning in 1997.  IKONICS’ quality function goal is to train all employees properly in both their work and in the importance of their work.  Internal records of quality, including related graphs and tables, are reviewed regularly and discussions are held among management and employees regarding how improvements might be realized.  The Company has rigorous materials selection procedures and also uses testing procedures to assure its products meet quality standards.
Research and Development and Intellectual Property
 
The Company incurred costs totaling 3.7% of sales, or $677,000, on research and development in 2018, and 4.0% of sales, or $689,000, in 2017.  In its research program, IKONICS has developed ultraviolet light-sensitive chemistries used in the manufacturing of screen print stencils, photoresists for abrasive etching and acid resist and prototyping ink jet fluids and ink jet receptive films.  The Company has a number of patents and patent applications on these chemistries and applications.  There can be no assurance that any patent granted to the Company will provide adequate protection to the Company’s intellectual property.  Within the Company, steps are taken to protect the Company’s trade secrets, including physical security, confidentiality and non-competition agreements with employees, non-disclosure agreements where applicable, and confidentiality agreements with vendors.  Over the past few years, the Company has directed a larger portion of it research and development resources towards industrial inkjettable fluids and ink jet receptive substrates along with dye sublimation films.  The Company has also invested significant resources for personnel and equipment to develop proprietary products and techniques for the etching of composite materials, industrial ceramics and electronic wafers.
 
In addition to its patents, the Company has various trademarks including the “IKONICS,” “Chromaline,” “IKONICS Imaging,” “Precision Abrasive Machining,” “SmartFlex,” “PhotoBrasive,” “AccuArt,”  “Nichols,” “image mate,” “Alpha FlexTrace,” “Alpha MicroCap,”, “DTX”, “SubTHAT!” and "IKONART" trademarks.

Raw Materials

The primary raw materials used by IKONICS in its production are photopolymers, polyester films, polyvinylacetates, polyvinylalcohols and water.  The Company’s purchasing staff leads in the identification of both domestic and foreign sources for raw materials and negotiates price and terms for all domestic and foreign markets.  IKONICS’ involvement in foreign markets has given it the opportunity to become a global buyer of raw materials at lower overall cost.  The Company has a number of suppliers for its operations.  Some suppliers provide a significant amount of key raw materials to the Company, but the Company believes alternative sources are available for most materials.  For those raw materials where an alternative source is not readily available, the Company has contingency raw material replacement plans.  To date, there have been no significant shortages of raw materials.  The Company believes it has good supplier relations.
Competition

The Company competes in its markets based on product development capability, quality, reliability, availability, technical support and price.  Though the screen printing market is much larger than the awards and recognition market, IKONICS commands significantly more market share in the latter.  IKONICS has two primary domestic competitors in its screen printing film business.  They are larger than IKONICS and possess greater resources than the Company in many areas.  The Company has numerous competitors in the market for screen print emulsions, many of whom are larger than IKONICS and possess greater resources.  The market for the Company’s abrasive etching products in the awards and recognition market has one significant competitor.  IKONICS considers itself to be the leader in this market.  There are significant competitors, using different technologies in the new markets being entered by the Company. The primary competition for AMS is from other machining methods, most of which are well established. The primary competition for DTX comes from old, well-established technologies based on wax and screen printing and new competition from laser technologies.
Government Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of federal, state and local industrial laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of material into the environment and protection of the environment.  The governmental authorities primarily responsible for regulating the Company’s environmental compliance are the Environmental Protection Agency, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District.  Failure to comply with the laws promulgated by these authorities may result in monetary sanctions, liability for environmental clean-up and other equitable remedies.  To maintain compliance, the Company may make occasional changes in its waste generation and disposal procedures.
 
These laws and regulations have not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures or competitive position of the Company.  The Company believes that it complies in all material respects with the various federal, state and local regulations that apply to its current operations.  Failure to comply with these regulations could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations and capital expenditures and such negative impact could be significant.
 
The Company also is subject to regulations from foreign governments covering the importation of certain chemicals. The Company believes that it complies in all material respects with these regulations that apply to its current products.  Failure to comply with these regulations could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations and capital expenditures and such negative impact could be significant.
