Overview
 We are a precision medicine company harnessing the power of molecular diagnostics and informatics to help combat infectious disease. We are developing molecular information products and services for global healthcare settings, helping to guide clinicians with more rapid and actionable information about life threatening infections, improve patient outcomes, and decrease the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, or MDROs. Our proprietary DNA tests and informatics address the rising threat of antibiotic resistance by helping physicians and other healthcare providers optimize care decisions for patients with acute infections.  
 Our molecular diagnostics and informatics products, product candidates and services combine our Acuitas® molecular diagnostics and Acuitas Lighthouse® informatics platform for use with our proprietary, curated MDRO knowledgebase. We are working to deliver our products and services, some in development, to a global network of customers and partners.

 We have established a number of commercial arrangements to support execution of our business strategy as we work to address the more than $2 billion potential market for precision medicine MDRO solutions. Our relationship with Merck & Co., Inc. includes investment from Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, or MGHIF, and a research agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme, or MSD, to provide access to MSD’s 250,000 clinical isolate SMART bacterial surveillance archive. In December 2017, we entered into a subcontractor agreement with ILÚM Health Solutions, LLC, an entity created by Merck’s Healthcare Services and Solutions  division, whereby ILÚM Health Solutions provided us with services to the Company in the performance of the Company’s CDC contract to deploy ILÚM’s commercially-available cloud- and mobile-based software platform for infectious disease management in three medical sites in Colombia with the aim of improving antibiotic use in resource-limited settings. 
 In September 2018, we announced a collaboration with the New York State Department of Health, or DOH, and ILÚM to develop a state-of-the-art research program to detect, track, and manage antimicrobial-resistant infections at healthcare institutions in New York State. The collaboration is called the New York State Infectious Disease Digital Health Initiative. The first portion of the collaboration is the completion of a development project, expected to last one year, that we believe will lead to a statewide program.  Under the demonstration project, OpGen will work with DOH’s Wadsworth Center and ILÚM to develop an infectious disease digital health and precision medicine platform that connects healthcare institutions to DOH and uses genomic microbiology for statewide surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance. The DOH, ILÚM and OpGen will work collaboratively to build a sustainable, flexible infectious diseases reporting, tracking and surveillance tool for antimicrobial resistance that can be applied across New York State.
 In October 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with QIAGEN N.V. to advance our rapid diagnostics for antimicrobial resistance. Under the agreement, we will work to commercialize QIAGEN’s EZ1 Advanced XL automated nucleic acid purification instrumentation (EZ1) and reagent kits in the United States to be used with our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products. Under the terms of 
 4


the agreement, we will purchase EZ1 instruments and reagent kits from QIAGEN and sell or place them with customers in the United States for use with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products, both RUO and, when 510(k) clearance is obtained, as diagnostic products.
 In June 2017, we entered into a global supply agreement to provide customer access to Thermo Fisher Scientific’s products to support the commercialization of our Acuitas Rapid Test and Acuitas Lighthouse Software products in development to combat MDROs. We are working to expand all of these established relationships and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future.
 We believe more rapid genetic identification methods will reduce morbidity from MDROs, reduce healthcare costs through reduced length of stay, and assist in the identification of targeted antibiotic therapy. Current conventional microbiology, largely unchanged in 50 years, requires one to two days for growth and phenotypic analysis and often leads to the use of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy in the early stages of infection.
 We are developing high resolution Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests designed to determine pathogen levels in clinical specimens and the key drug resistance gene profiles of Gram-negative organisms. Our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) tests are available for sale for research use only.  Following completion of our research and development efforts and receipt of appropriate regulatory clearances, we anticipate our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests will be used in the clinical setting to provide pathogen and antibiotic resistance gene information to aid in decision-making for patients at risk for cUTI, lower respiratory tract infections, blood stream infections, and for testing of bacterial isolates.
 Lead Rapid Diagnostics and Acuitas Lighthouse Software
 Our Acuitas products in development are: the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Isolates) for testing of bacterial isolates from multiple human sample types, the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) for direct testing of urine samples for patients at risk for cUTI and to identify potential antibiotic resistance markers, and our Acuitas Lighthouse Software to aid in the management of test results and to predict antibiotic resistance to six classes of front-line antibiotics. Our lead product in development is the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) for patients at risk for cUTI. The AMR Gene Panel (Urine) is a direct test that will be able to be performed in under three hours to identify five pathogens associated with urinary tract infections, or UTIs, and their levels, and 47 genes associated with antibiotic resistance. We anticipate that the Acuitas Lighthouse Software will be used to provide additional interpretation of test results including probability of resistance for fourteen antibiotics commonly used to treat cUTI. Approximately 10,000 bacterial isolates from the Merck SMART surveillance network and other sources have been tested and added to the Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase to support development and use of the Acuitas Lighthouse Software antibiotic resistance prediction decision-making algorithms. In September 2018 we completed specimen accrual and testing of urine specimens for the clinical verification study for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) rapid diagnostic test and Acuitas Lighthouse Software. The three participating clinical sites were Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Geisinger Health System, and Intermountain Healthcare. The results of the study, which tested 670 remnant urine specimens from patients at increased risk for cUTI, confirmed the targeted performance of the new test to identify patients with UTIs and subsequently to predict antibiotic resistance to six classes of front line antibiotics. These data and additional data from our ongoing research support the potential for the Acuitas Lighthouse Software to provide actionable antibiotic resistance prediction information directly from clinical specimens in under three hours. The figure below describes the workflow and anticipated results from our new testing approach.
Current Diagnostic Tests and Informatics

Our FDA cleared and CE marked QuickFISH and PNA FISH products are powered by PNA technology and provide rapid pathogen identification, typically in less than 30 minutes from a positive blood culture result.
 
We currently offer our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) tests to contract research organizations, or CROs, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other healthcare providers for research use only.  
 
We offer our Acuitas Lighthouse Software to health care facilities and public health  facilities for infection control and surveillance purposes.  
 Our Strategy
 We are using our current product and service offerings, and will use our products in development to build and commercialize a comprehensive precision medicine solution for combatting infectious disease with a focus on developing diagnostic tests for rapid pathogen identification and genetic profiling, antibiotic resistance analysis and advanced informatics to store and analyze MDRO and other infectious disease data for hospitals, out-patient settings and other healthcare providers.
 The two core components of our strategy are development and commercialization of rapid diagnostic tests and leveraging our Acuitas Lighthouse information services into new markets and channels.
  
• | Rapid diagnostics – We are developing OpGen-branded Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests for use on the Thermo Fisher Scientific Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 5 Real-Time PCR System. The first of these new tests will be for antibiotic resistance testing of bacterial isolates. The second indication for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel is for management of patients with cUTI. We anticipate developing tests for additional clinical indications such as lower respiratory tract infections and for new antibiotic decision- making applications. The second rapid diagnostics growth driver is anticipated to be through strategic partner relationships where we will work to expand channel access for our proprietary DNA tests through development and subsequent use of these tests, utilizing the Acuitas Lighthouse Software on established rapid in vitro diagnostic testing platforms.

Molecular Information Business
 We are working to build a unique and highly proprietary molecular information business. Our approach combines FDA-cleared and CE-marked rapid diagnostics with our Acuitas Lighthouse Software. We are developing an integrated solution based on a genomic knowledgebase of drug-resistant pathogens. Our approach involves sourcing thousands of pathogens from hospitals worldwide and completing genomic analysis including DNA sequencing and drug susceptibility testing of each individual pathogen. These data are combined along with hospital patient data and other information in our Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase. We anticipate using this information and insights we derive from it to help power our rapid diagnostic products, healthcare management solutions and new applications to support pharmaceutical companies.
Recent Events
 Business Initiatives
 
In October 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with QIAGEN N.V. to advance our rapid diagnostics for antimicrobial resistance. Under the agreement, we will work to commercialize QIAGEN’s EZ1 Advanced XL automated nucleic acid purification instrumentation (EZ1) and reagent kits in the United States to be used with our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products. Under the terms of the agreement, we will purchase EZ1 instruments and reagent kits from QIAGEN and sell or place them with customers in the United States for use with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products, both RUO and, when 510(k) clearance is obtained, as diagnostic products. The EZ1 is a Class I Medical Device listed with the FDA that provides full automation with sample preparation throughput of up to 14 samples per one-hour run. QIAGEN is the global leader for nucleic acid sample preparation with a full line of instruments and reagents. There are thousands of EZ1 instruments currently used in laboratories worldwide.
 
In September 2018, we announced a collaboration with the New York State DOH and ILÚM to develop a state-of-the-art research program to detect, track, and manage antimicrobial-resistant infections at healthcare institutions in New York State. The collaboration is called the New York State Infectious Disease Digital Health Initiative. The first portion of the collaboration is the completion of a development project, expected to last one year, that we believe will lead to a statewide program.  Under the demonstration project, OpGen will work with DOH’s Wadsworth Center and ILÚM to develop an infectious disease digital health and precision medicine platform that connects healthcare institutions to DOH and uses genomic microbiology for statewide surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance. The DOH, ILÚM and OpGen will work collaboratively to build a sustainable, flexible infectious diseases reporting, tracking and surveillance tool for antimicrobial resistance that can be applied across New York State. The goal of this project is to improve patient outcomes and save healthcare dollars by integrating real-time epidemiologic surveillance with rapid delivery of resistance results to care-givers via web-based and mobile platforms. ILÚM is leading the project with the implementation of its technology platform. OpGen is providing its Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens along with its Acuitas Lighthouse Software for high resolution pathogen tracking. OpGen will receive a $1.5 million contract for the 12-month demonstration portion of the project, with the potential for full implementation during the next four years, should certain milestones be achieved by all parties involved.
 
In June 2017, the Company entered into a global supply agreement to use Thermo Fisher Scientific’s technology to support the commercialization of its rapid molecular products. Under the terms of the agreement, OpGen will commercialize the AMR Gene Panel tests for Pathogen ID and resistance genes on Thermo Fisher’s new mid-throughput real-time PCR system. In January 2018, the Company entered into a second global supply agreement to incorporate Thermo Fisher Scientific’s real-time PCR technology in the company’s Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests. Specific products covered under these agreements include the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System, TaqMan® Fast Advanced Master Mix and TaqMan® Probes for quick, multiplexed gene detection.
 In October 2017, the Company announced that it was awarded a contract from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, to develop smartphone-based clinical decision support solutions for antimicrobial stewardship, or AMS, and infection control in low- and middle-income countries. The one-year $860,000 award began September 30, 2017 and funded development and evaluation of cloud-based mobile software. The Company worked with partners ILÚM  and Universidad El Bosque, or UEB, of Bogota, Colombia. The Company’s teaming partner ILÚM provided its cloud- and mobile-based software platform, which integrates electronic patient data and local empiric treatment guidelines to support antimicrobial stewardship. The ILÚM platform is state-of-the-art mobile AMS software that is commercially available and in use in major medical centers. The mobile platform was translated into Spanish and was extended to quickly identify patients requiring infection control precautions, assist with the implementation of appropriate precautions, and assist with the collection and tracking of indicators for monitoring implementation of infection control precautions. During 2018 we deployed the software in three medical sites in Colombia to assess the effectiveness of the effort.  Through the initial pilot, we gained experience and positive results to support the expansion of this important initiative further. The 
 7


three sites from the project intend to continue using the Acumen software tool, and we are in discussions with ILÚM to establish a distribution relationship for Colombia and the region.

Market Overview
 
Antibiotic Resistance – An Urgent Global Issue
 We believe that antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global healthcare issue. MDROs have been prioritized as an urgent national and global threat by the CDC, the executive branch of the federal government and the World Health Organization. In September 2014, The White House issued a National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. This strategy calls for the strengthening of surveillance efforts to combat resistance, the development and use of innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria and antibiotic stewardship and development.
 The CDC estimates that in the United States more than two million people are sickened every year with antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result. Antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable but often avoidable costs to the U.S. healthcare system. In most cases, these infections require prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extended hospital stays, additional doctor visits and healthcare facilities use, and result in greater disability and death compared with infections that are treatable with antibiotics. Estimates for the total economic cost to the U.S. economy are difficult to calculate but have been estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs annually. As described in a December 2014 report issued by the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance commissioned by the U.K. Prime Minister, titled “Antimicrobial Resistance: Tackling a Crisis for the Health and Wealth of Nations,” 300 million people are expected to die prematurely because of drug resistance over the next 35 years, which could result in $60 to $100 trillion worth of lost economic output if the problem of antimicrobial drug resistance is not resolved.
 Over the last decade, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, frequently referred to as Superbugs, have been implicated in severe HAIs and their occurrence has increased steadily. For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or K. pneumoniae, is responsible for roughly 15% of Gram-negative infections in hospital intensive care units. Infections caused by KPC strains have few treatment options and are associated with a mortality rate upwards of 50%.
 Exacerbating the problems associated with the emergence of these highly resistant KPC strains is their propensity to cause outbreaks in healthcare institutions. These pathogens persist both in the flora of hospitalized patients and in the hospital environment, and they have the capacity to silently colonize patients or hospital personnel by establishing residence in the gastrointestinal tract without causing any signs of infection. Individuals can be silently colonized or become asymptomatic carriers for long periods of time, with detection of these carriers often proving difficult. These silent carriers act as reservoirs for continued transmission, which makes subsequent spread difficult to control and outbreaks difficult to stop. In addition, KPC strains can survive for several hours on the hands of hospital personnel, which likely facilitates the spread of organisms from patient to patient. Effective control of KPC outbreaks requires a detailed understanding of how transmission occurs, but current technologies do not allow healthcare providers to routinely perform these investigations on a timely basis.
 The lack of currently available treatment options and scarcity of new treatment options in development are compounding the emerging Superbug problem. It has been close to 30 years since a new class of antibiotics was developed and successfully introduced. As a 
 9


result, we believe that rapid, accurate identification of the pathogen and its genetic make-up, screening, infection control and antibiotic stewardship have become one of the most powerful weapons in the fight to contain this threat.
 The emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens has made the treatment of patients with UTIs a growing problem in the United States and internationally. There are approximately 10 million patients each year in the United States with UTIs and more than one million of these patients have cUTI often requiring hospitalization intravenous antibiotic therapy. Among these patients E.Coli represents the most common pathogen, and recent data indicate that 18.3% of U.S. E. Coli isolates extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) resistant. These patients present complicated therapeutic choices for clinicians and often require last resort carbapenem antibiotics. The rate of ESBL resistant E. Coli increased 34% annually between 2010 – 2014. Therapy with carbapenem antibiotics has contributed to growing Carbapenem resistance (CRE) rates and high patient treatment costs. A large outcomes study recently completed by the Company indicated that average cost to treat an ESBL E. Coli patient was $25,000 while patients with ESBL K. pneumonia infections cost over $60,000.
 Based on industry analyses, we believe the global HAI market is a $2 billion dollar market with the molecular diagnostic segment representing a fast growing segment of such market with multiple high acuity patients and significant infectious sites, including UTIs, surgical site infections, pneumonia and bloodstream infections.

 Acuitas AMR Gene Panel and Acuitas Lighthouse Software 
 The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel is a qualitative and semi-quantitative nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test that is capable of simultaneous detection and identification of multiple bacterial nucleic acids and select genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in urine specimens or bacterial colonies isolated from urine and other body sites. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of UTIs for patients at risk of cUTI. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) employs automated deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, extraction on the Qiagen® EZ1 Advanced XL and multiplex real-time PCR on the Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio 5 PCR System. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test detects 47 gene targets which span 600 subtypes and convey resistance to 9 classes of antibiotics directly from urine and isolated colonies, and is currently sold as a RUO test.  Gene families detected include: KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, OXA, CTXM-1, CTXM-9, CMY, MCR, and resistance genes to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. From urine specimens, the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) will semi-quantitatively detect the most common bacterial causes of cUTI (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, E. faecalis). While the test is currently designed to detect only five bacterial species, this test will detect resistance genes in other organisms if present without providing species identification. Test results are provided in under three hours, compared with traditional microbiology methods, which can take two to three days. 
 We are also developing the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Isolates) test for testing bacterial isolates. The RUO test is being used in the New York State Infectious Disease Digital Health Initiative for testing of bacterial isolates. The test is genotyping carbapenem resistant isolates from three health systems in the New York City Metro Area. Results are subsequently analyzed by the Acuitas Lighthouse Software to support a series of infection control tracking capabilities that are of interest to the Department of Public Health and healthcare providers. Following the anticipated FDA clearance of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Isolates) test, we expect use of the test to expand to include use of the test information to support antibiotic decision making in acute care patient management of patients with MDRO infections. 
 The Acuitas Lighthouse Software manages and evaluates data that identify the most common microbial causes of cUTI and key genetic determinants of antibiotic drug resistance, based on the amplification data of gene targets extracted from urine specimens. Through analysis of this data, the Acuitas Lighthouse Software can identify five bacterial species and predict resistance to up to fourteen  different antibiotics from across nine  antibiotic classes including: Aminoglycosides, Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Fluoroquinolones, Polymyxins, Penicillins, Sulfonamides, Trimethoprim and Vancomycin. The Acuitas Lighthouse Software consists of the Acuitas Lighthouse Portal, a web application; the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine, data analysis software; and draws from the Lighthouse Knowledgebase, a relational database management system; and minor supporting software components. The Acuitas Lighthouse Software was selected by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Laboratories for the genomic microbiology component of the New York State Infectious Disease Digital Health Initiative. All components of the Acuitas Lighthouse Software are securely hosted in a cloud-hosted, web-based application. The input to Acuitas Lighthouse Software is a data file generated by processing the results from the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test through the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) Gene Analysis Software. This input file indicates which gene targets were detected by the assay and is loaded into the Acuitas Lighthouse Software via an interface of the Acuitas Lighthouse Portal, accessed by the user through a web browser. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) Gene Analysis Software results are retained by the Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase and are sent to the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine for analysis. The Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine contains software implementations of data models that were derived using a training panel of thousands of bacterial isolates with detailed genotypic and phenotypic 
 10


characterizations, all stored within the Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase. These models, each specific to one (1) microbial species and antibiotic drug pairing, are used to make predictions of antibiotic resistance by analyzing the loaded input data. The results from the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine indicate whether there is evidence of resistance detected through the presence of specific genes, and if there is known intrinsic resistance to certain drugs. These final results are reported to the user via a Prediction Report and the Resistance Dashboard interface in the Acuitas Lighthouse Portal; both displays present the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine output in combination with selected input data and metadata, as well as the semi-quantitative counts of gene copies / mL for urine specimens. Development of the Acuitas Lighthouse Software and the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) was the result of a comprehensive, multi-year development effort to help address urgent clinical needs for improved rapid antibiotic decision-making capabilities.
 The figure below describes the workflow for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test and the Acuitas Lighthouse Software.
 

FISH Products
 We have commercialized 12 QuickFISH and PNA FISH diagnostic test products in the United States and Europe for the identification of various infectious pathogens. The pathogens identified and differentiated by our FISH products are:
 
 
QuickFISH | PNA FISH 
Staphylococcus | Staphylococcus 
Enterococcus | Enterococcus 
Gram-negative bacteria | Gram-negative bacteria
Candida | Candida 

 
Our FISH products can provide pathogen identification and differentiation within 20 to 90 minutes of positive blood culture results. The tests provide actionable information that can be used by the healthcare provider to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy.
 Approximately 70 U.S. hospital customers purchased our FISH products over the past twelve months, and we sell our FISH products to hospitals in 8 countries with antibiotic stewardship programs. Our hospital customers include academic medical centers, tertiary care hospitals and community hospitals.

Research and Development
 
We intend to continue to invest in the development of additional Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests and our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics platform, and to support commercial sales of our QuickFISH rapid identification tests. Our current focus is on completing the development of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) and our other product offerings to provide actionable, precise diagnostics powered by our Acuitas Lighthouse Software for rapid diagnostics of pathogens, determination of the appropriate antibiotics to treat the infection and accumulation of actionable surveillance data to provide information useful for monitoring and controlling outbreaks and promoting antibiotic stewardship. The figure below highlights our current products, products under development, and their regulatory status.
 
Our ongoing and anticipated research and development efforts include:
  
• | development of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests for additional indications and sample types; clinical trial work to support FDA submissions for commercial launch of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continued investments in our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics platform, focused on (i) data warehouse and portal for MDRO data and (ii) antibiotic analysis;

 In February 2019, we announced the completion of the clinical trials needed to support the 510(k) submission for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Isolates). The clinical trials tested more than 1,000 clinical isolates at four participating clinical sites: The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health; University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center; and IHMA, Inc. We have completed key analytical validation testing activities including reproducibility studies and DNA sequencing of over 1,000 isolates to support the planned 510(k) submission.
 Commercial Sales
 
We currently sell and market our products and services directly in the United States through a dedicated sales and marketing support team. Internationally, we sell our products through a network of distributors in eight countries. We operate a subsidiary in Denmark that provides support for our European customers and to distributors. In 2018, we established OpGen Colombia SAS to commercialize our products in Colombia and to support sales on a direct basis and through distributors in South America and Central America. We anticipate expanding our commercial organization in conjunction with the anticipated FDA clearance to commercialize our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel and Acuitas Lighthouse Software products. Our strategy to build demand for our products following receipt of such regulatory clearance includes completing clinical verification studies, sales of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests for RUO, and in conjunction with such FDA clearance entering into channel partner co-marketing and distribution agreements.
 
We are generating data to support the commercialization of our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) and Acuitas Lighthouse Software products through a structured clinical verification program including academic medical centers and clinical collaborators. In November 2018 we announced that we have completed specimen accrual and testing of urine specimens for the clinical verification study with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test and Acuitas Lighthouse Software. The three participating clinical sites were Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Geisinger Health System, and Intermountain Healthcare. The results of the study, which tested 670 remnant urine specimens from patients at increased risk for cUTI, will be summarized and discussed in a peer-reviewed manuscript anticipated to be published in 2019.
 
In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) for infection control purposes and pharmaceutical surveillance research as research use only tests. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) tests will be available while the Company completes clinical trials and regulatory submissions to support FDA clearance to commercialize such products for broader clinical use. We anticipate that customers who use the products as RUO tests for infection control and clinical research will serve as a potential installed base for the FDA cleared products. Our rapid pathogen identification FISH products are used by approximately 80 customers in the US and internationally. Many of these customers are potential customers for our FDA-cleared Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests. We are working to expand our market reach by entering into strategic co-marketing relationships with larger diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies and by expanding our network of distributors globally.
 We operate in one segment. Substantially all of our operations are in the United States. 
 
Competition
 
We  are developing a molecular information business focused on leading a transformation in microbiology and infectious disease through precision medicine products and services that combine genomic data and informatics. Our approach combines proprietary, FDA cleared DNA tests developed for use with  our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics and data warehouse offerings. Our competitors include rapid diagnostic testing and traditional microbiology companies, commercial laboratories, information technology companies, and hospital laboratories who may internally develop testing capabilities. Principal competitive factors in our target market include: 
 13


organizational size, scale, and breadth of product offerings; rapidity of test results; quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data and confidence in diagnostic results; cost effectiveness; ease of use; and regulatory approval status.
 Our principal competition comes from traditional methods used by healthcare providers to diagnose and screen for MDROs and from other molecular diagnostic companies creating screening and diagnostic products such as Cepheid, Becton-Dickinson, bioMérieux, Accelerate Diagnostics, T2 Biosystems, GenMark, Curetis and Nanosphere. We believe our focus on identifying antibiotic-resistant genes, rather than primarily organisms, the genes and associated diseases included in our gene tests, and our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics offerings distinguish us from such competitors.
 We also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as ARUP Laboratories, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Pathnostics, and EuroFins, which have strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic laboratory services.
 Competitors may develop their own versions of our product offerings in countries where we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized.
 Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, research and development and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by hospitals, physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our products and services, or offer products and services at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower our list prices and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause our stock price to decline.
 Manufacturing
 
During 2018, we manufactured our  FDA-cleared and CE-marked QuickFISH and PNA FISH products in our Gaithersburg, Maryland facility. 
 Manufacturing of our FDA-cleared products is performed under the current Good Manufacturing Practices – Quality System Regulation as required by the FDA for the manufacture of IVD labeled products. These regulations carefully control the manufacture, testing and release of IVD products as well as raw material receipt and control. We also have ongoing postmarket surveillance and vigilance responsibilities under FDA regulations, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA’s requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA’s Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. 
Seasonality of Business
 We do not believe our business is subject to seasonality. However, our business can be subject to and affected by the business practices of our business partners. To the extent that the availability of inventory or materials from or development practices of our partners is seasonal, our sales may be subject to fluctuations quarter to quarter or year over year.
Quality Assurance
 Our quality assurance function oversees the quality of our laboratory and our FDA-cleared and CE-marked diagnostic products as well as the quality systems used in research and development, client services, billing operations and sales and marketing. We have established a quality assurance system across our entire business, including implementation and maintenance, document control, supplier qualification, corrective or preventive actions, oversight, and employee training processes. We monitor and seek to improve our quality over time in compliance with all applicable regulations.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
We procure PCR amplification reagents and the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System from Thermo Fisher Scientific. DNA purification reagents and the EZ1 DNA Purification System are procured from QIAGEN, NV. We purchase the PNA probes, glass slides and specialty consumables for our QuickFISH products from third party manufacturers who have long lead times and who manufacture several of these products for us on a sole source basis. We also purchase our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. While we have developed alternative sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or whether alternative sources will be available 
 14


when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to manufacture our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products or our QuickFISH products, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, our business would be negatively affected.
 Payments and Reimbursement
 
Our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) tests and QuickFISH tests are, and other future products and services will be, sold to hospitals and public health organizations as products and on a fee-for-service basis. When hospital and health system clients purchase our QuickFISH tests we bill them directly for the purchase of test kits and consumables.  In the future, we envision selling our Acuitas Lighthouse Software to health systems, hospitals and long-term care facilities under capitated, flat-rate contracts. We believe that hospitals will recoup costs of our products and services by obtaining reimbursement from the government or private insurance companies for in-bed occupancies, which traditionally includes all testing required for admitted patients. When our tests are used prior to hospital admission, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our products may bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products.
Intellectual Property
 
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, in order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, invention assignment and licensing agreements. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation. In addition, we have what we consider to be reasonable security measures in place to maintain confidentiality. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had total ownership rights to 23 patents, including seven pending United States non-provisional patent applications, and 16 issued United States patents. More specifically, as of December 31, 2018, related to our FISH products, we had ownership rights to 11 patents, including three pending United States non-provisional patent applications, and eight issued United States patents. These issued patents began to expire in November 2024 and will be fully expired by March 2032. As of December 31, 2018, related to our Acuitas products, we had ownership rights to three pending United States non-provisional patent applications and no issued United States patents. As of December 31, 2018, related to our other products, we had ownership rights to nine patents, including one pending United States non-provisional patent application, and eight issued United States patents related to our other products. These issued patents began to expire in June 2026 and will be fully expired by May 2032. A majority of our issued and exclusively licensed FISH patents expired over the last six years. The remaining 23 exclusively licensed United States FISH patents expire between 2019 and 2024.
 We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications (including the patent applications listed above) may not result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology.
 We require all employees and technical consultants working for us to execute confidentiality agreements, which provide that all confidential information received by them during the course of the employment, consulting or business relationship be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with our research employees provide that all inventions, discoveries and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived by the individual while he or she is employed by us are assigned to us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 Regulation
 The following is a summary of the regulations materially affecting our business and operations.
 Federal Oversight of Research-Use-Only Products
 
We currently offer for sale and sell our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) tests to CROs, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other health care facilities for research use only.  RUO and investigational use only, or IUO, products are not intended for human clinical use and must be properly labeled in accordance with FDA guidance. Claims for RUOs and IUOs related to safety, effectiveness, or clinical utility or that are intended for human diagnostic or prognostic use are prohibited. In November 2013, the 
 15


FDA issued guidance titled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only – Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” This guidance sets forth the requirements to utilize such designations, labeling requirements and acceptable distribution practices, among other requirements.
 Some products are for RUO or for investigational use only, or IUO. RUO and IUO products are not intended for human clinical use and must be properly labeled in accordance with FDA guidance. Claims for RUOs and IUOs related to safety, effectiveness, or clinical utility or that are intended for human diagnostic or prognostic use are prohibited. In November 2013, the FDA issued guidance titled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only – Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” This guidance sets forth the requirements to utilize such designations, labeling requirements and acceptable distribution practices, among other requirements.
 Mere placement of an RUO or IUO label on an IVD product does not render the device exempt from otherwise applicable clearance, approval or other requirements. The FDA may determine that the device is intended for use in clinical diagnosis based on other evidence, including how the device is marketed.
 Our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test was launched for RUO purposes in January 2018.  We cannot predict the potential effect the FDA’s current and forthcoming guidance IUOs/RUOs will have on our product offerings or materials used to perform our diagnostic services. We cannot be certain that the FDA might not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our diagnostic services. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our diagnostic services be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of service or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform the service.
 We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for our surveillance and diagnostic services, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. On November 17, 2015, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held one such hearing entitled “Examining the Regulation of Diagnostic Tests and Laboratory Operations.” We expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA, which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our diagnostic services or to develop and introduce new services.
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
The FDA also has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.
 Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed into either Class 1 or Class 2.
 Class 1 devices are deemed to pose the lowest risk to the patient. Accordingly, Class 1 devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny and need only comply with the FDA’s General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions. Unless specifically exempted in the regulations, general controls require a company that intends to market a Class 1 device, like us, to gain clearance for marketing through the 510(k) process. Many Class 1 devices, however, are exempt from 510(k) clearance because the level of risk is low.
 Class 2 devices are considered higher risk devices than Class 1 devices. Class 2 devices are subject to General Controls as well as additional Special Controls. Special Controls may include labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and post market surveillance. Generally companies that intend to market Class 2 devices, like us, must comply with applicable regulations and submit a 510(k) premarket submission for review to receive clearance to list and market their devices. The 510(k) must establish substantial equivalence to a predicate device. Some Class 2 devices are exempt from filing a 510(k) but in some instances, Class 2 devices may be required to file a Premarket Approval, or PMA, application.
 Class 3 devices are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, and require a PMA before commercialization.
 16


All medical device manufacturers must register their establishments with the FDA; such registrations require the payment of user fees. In addition, both 510(k) premarket submissions and PMA applications are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. 
 510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
We are currently working to submit our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests for clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act.  Such tests are classified as medical devices, and we have to submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications. FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months. On average the review time is approximately six months, but it can take significantly longer than twelve months in some instances, as the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) notice, or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements to products that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances, but we cannot guarantee that the future enhancements, should they occur, will be exempt from new 510(k) clearances.
 
De Novo Classification Request
 
The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, added the De Novo classification option as an alternate pathway to classify novel medical devices that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a not substantially equivalent  determination in response to a premarket notification 510(k) submission. The FDAMA allows a sponsor to submit a De Novo classification request to the FDA for a product otherwise requiring a PMA application without first being required to submit a 510(k) application.
Premarket Approval Pathway
 
A PMA application must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or the 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. None of our products are currently approved under a premarket approval.
 Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are usually required to support non-exempt Class 1 and Class 2 510(k) premarket submissions. Clinical trials may also be required to support certain marketing claims. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an investigational device exemption, or IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to conducting the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing 
 17


information, and an Investigational Review Board, or IRB approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the investigational device exemption application is approved by the FDA. If the clinical trial design is deemed to be “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may eligible for the “abbreviated” IDE requirements; in some instances IVD clinical trials may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if certain labeling requirements are met. All clinical trials conducted to support a premarket submission must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent, oversight by an IRB and healthcare privacy requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA or the IRB review board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, the results of our clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product. Similarly, in Europe the clinical study must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies of high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country.
 21st Century Cures Act
 The 21st Century Cures Act contains several sections specific to antimicrobial innovation and antibiotic stewardship, and other provisions related to medical device innovations.  The Company believes that implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act may have a positive impact on the Company’s businesses through facilitating innovation and/or reducing the regulatory burden imposed on medical device manufacturers, especially those involved in antimicrobial susceptibility testing.  The Company cannot predict how and when these initiatives under the Act will be implemented at the federal or state level in which we may do business, or the effect any future regulation will have on us.
 Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 Numerous regulatory requirements apply to our products classified as devices would continue to apply. These include:
  
• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our cleared devices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | notices of corrections or removals.
--+------------------------------------

 OpGen’s Gaithersburg, Maryland facility is currently registered as a manufacturer with the FDA to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with quality system regulation and other regulations.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which might include any of the following sanctions: (1) untitled letters, Form 483 observations, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; (2) unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; (3) customer notifications for repair, replacement and refunds; (4) recall, detention or seizure of our products; (5) operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; (6) refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products; (7) 
 18


operating restrictions; (8) withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; (9) refusal to grant export approval for our products; or (10) criminal prosecution.
 After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: all of the relevant elements of the QSR, labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, the medical device reporting (which requires the manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA), and other post-market requirements.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers, such as us, and by certain vendors of ours, also known as our business associates. The regulations include limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information and impose notification requirements in the event of a breach of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
 We have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements.
 In addition to Federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our business. If our business expands internationally, we would be subject to compliance with other laws regarding confidentiality of health information and privacy.
 New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. However, we can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
 Federal and State Physician Self-referral Prohibitions
 As a manufacturer and seller of diagnostic tests, we are subject to the Federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar restrictions under the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law. Together, these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payor for any clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
 Both the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as clinical advisory board services, speaking engagements and other consulting activities. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law.
 However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with the Stark Law, the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, or similar state laws. We would be required to refund any payments we receive pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payor or the Medicare program, as applicable.
 
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
 
 
• | denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possible exclusion from Federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
 
Further, if we submit claims in violation of the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, we can be held liable to the payer for any reimbursement received for the services by us. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by Federal and Maryland law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
 Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may result in imprisonment for up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 in the case of individuals and $500,000 in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-Kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from Federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal healthcare programs. Actions which violate the Anti-Kickback Law also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
 Although the Anti-Kickback Law applies only to Federal healthcare programs, a number of states, including Maryland, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. Violations of Maryland’s anti-kickback law are punishable by tiered criminal penalties based on the crime with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and fines of up to $200,000, or both. Civil penalties include three times the amount of any overpayment made in violation of the statute.
 Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
 In addition to statutory exceptions to the Anti-Kickback Law, regulations provide for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. There are no regulatory safe harbors to the Maryland anti-kickback law.
 Among the safe harbors that may be relevant to us is the discount safe harbor. The discount safe harbor potentially applies to discounts provided by providers and suppliers, including laboratories, to physicians or institutions. If the terms of the discount safe harbor are met, the discounts will not be considered prohibited remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Maryland does not have a discount safe harbor.
 The personal services safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Law provides that remuneration paid to a referral source for personal services will not violate the Anti-Kickback Law provided all of the elements of that safe harbor are met. One element is that if the agreement is intended to provide for the services of the physician on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement must specify exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals.
 Our personal services arrangements with some physicians may not meet the specific requirement of this safe harbor that the agreement specify exactly the schedule of the intervals of time to be spent on the services because the nature of the services, such as speaking engagements, does not lend itself to exact scheduling and therefore meeting this element of the personal services safe harbor is impractical. Failure to meet the terms of the safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances.

While we believe that we are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Law and the Maryland anti-kickback law, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, academic institutions and other customers will not be subject to investigation or challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the Anti-Kickback Law and the Maryland anti-kickback law could have a negative effect on our business.
 Other Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the Federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations.
 Further, the Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the Federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the Federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud, also known as qui tam lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. It is not uncommon for qui tam lawsuits to be filed by employees, competitors or consultants.
 Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. Maryland has an analogous state false claims act applicable to state health plans and programs, as do many other states.
 
International Regulation
 
Sales of diagnostic tests like our QuickFISH and PNA FISH products outside the United States would be subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we would need to obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. OpGen currently distributes its QuickFISH and PNA FISH products in the European Union through its Denmark office. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly. If we elect to, or are required to, seek clearance of or approval for any of our products from the FDA, we may be able to commercialize such products with shorter lead time in international markets, but would need to establish international operations in order to do so.
Environmental Matters
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of Federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
Glossary  
 
The following scientific, healthcare, regulatory and OpGen-specific terms are used throughout this Annual Report:
 “Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine)” is a qualitative and semi-quantitative nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test that is capable of simultaneous detection and identification of multiple bacterial nucleic acids and select genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in urine specimens or bacterial colonies isolated from urine.
 “Acuitas Lighthouse” is our informatics platform, developed internally to provide real-time information on the MDRO status for patients and hospitals. We combine our molecular test information and microbiology test results from our customized CLIA-based tests to create Acuitas Lighthouse profiles for hospitals, health systems and communities, which we call our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics, and we are developing Acuitas Lighthouse Software for use with our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel in development. Acuitas Lighthouse profiling facilitates MDRO tracking and results can be aggregated with hospital data to provide customized reports including alerts, prevalence, trend analysis and transmission information.
