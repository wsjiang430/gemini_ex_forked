Item 1. Business
 
PolarityTE - Welcome to the SHIFT
 
PolarityTE Inc., headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a young and growing commercial-stage, biotechnology company founded in 2016 - and we believe the first of its kind. We are focused on the design and development of novel technology platforms that promote the regeneration of complex, cellular-derived tissue substrates and the propagation of self-organizing composite systems. We have developed, and will continue to evolve these technologies and platforms through uniquely targeted and yet comprehensive approaches to the interactome. The interactome is the complete set of physical interactions between molecules within a cell that underlies most genotype-to-phenotype relationships and modulates nearly all complex biological pathways and cellular networks seen in living systems. Understanding this, we believe that to effectively deliver our advanced technologies to patients we must not simply deliver products, but rather robust platform systems and evolving technology foundations that are intelligent, multi-functional, and able to adapt and evolve. Over the last year we have established and advanced three of our pipeline programs consisting of our core “TE” program, (which includes our first commercial product, SkinTE), our Related Technology Derivative program (“RTD”), and our Advanced Research Center program (“ARC”).
 
A glossary is provided at the end of this Item 1, which you may find helpful in reading this report.
 
Vision
 
We aspire to be a global biotechnology company that provides superior, tangible, and pragmatic platform technologies that provide superior results to patients, while reducing costs and promoting improved health economics for patients, providers, and payors. We believe this can be accomplished through our pursuit of complex simplicity, which embodies the development of robust cell/tissue-derived therapies that can be efficiently produced and deployed. PolarityTE is committed to delivering transformative technology that positively impacts humanity.
 
PolarityTE was founded by a dedicated group of doctors and scientists from The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who left to become part of something bigger. Something that could transform the future of medicine. We believe that living systems require more than a simple singular input (for example a growth factor, stem cell, or nano-particle), to produce a complex output. Therefore, we took a different direction and developed multi-tiered platform technologies that propagate the necessary complex substrate required for regenerating fully-functional tissue, such as skin, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, and neural elements, as well as solid and hollow organ composite tissue systems. We have engineered and developed our regenerative materials and core tissue substrate technology platforms to allow us to induce, maintain, and promote the integrated polarity, organized assembly, and interface development of cells and tissues, so that they replicate regenerative healing in the body and are not seen as foreign by the immune system.
 
The core technology of TE products is minimally polarized functional units (“MPFUs”) consisting of self-complexing intelligent regenerative materials (“SCIRM”). SCIRM within an MPFU form polarizing, multi-cellular aggregates that act as an intrinsic, regenerative bio-reactor capable of expanding, proliferating, and synthesizing cells, materials, factors, or systems necessary for regenerating full-thickness, three-dimensional tissue. The TE products we develop begin with the patient’s own tissue to produce SCIRM that address the specific tissue or system needed for the patient’s care. Our product pipeline focuses on the development of regenerative products for a variety of tissue types and organ systems that are commonly altered, injured, or destroyed by a variety of diseases, pathologies, traumatic events, and medical interventions.
 
SkinTE, our first tissue product, was registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2017, and is now commercially available for the repair, reconstruction, replacement, and regeneration of skin in patients who have a need for treatment of acute or chronic wounds, burns, surgical reconstruction events, scar revision, or removal of dysfunctional skin grafts. We are pursuing a regional plan for commercial rollout that began in late October 2018, and we now have 24 sales representatives in the field marketing SkinTE.
 
OsteoTE is designed to utilize the patient’s bone to repair, reconstruct, replace, supplement, or regenerate bone damage or defects. We registered OsteoTE with the FDA in December 2018. We are preparing for the first application of the product in a clinical setting, which we are endeavoring to achieve in the first half of 2019.

Human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”) are governed by specific FDA regulations the provide for a registration pathway that is different than the pathway for traditional drug candidates. SkinTE and OsteoTE are both registered as HCT/Ps under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.
 
We have a number of additional TE products under development. The following table illustrates the status of our TE product pipeline.



RTD and ARC represent research and development of new science and product opportunities based on what we learned while developing the TE platform. RTD is focused on altered state analytes for the generation of composite materials that can be utilized for the augmentation, modulation, and regulation of cell and tissue-derived systems. ARC is focused on the design and development of gene transfer, small molecule synthesis, composite therapeutics, and alteration of self-propagating cell/tissue-derived bioreactors.
 
The following table shows the research projects we are pursuing through RTD and ARC programs.
 

We have significant research facilities and a well-educated and skilled team of scientists and researchers. These resources are highly beneficial to the work we are doing on our TE products and in RTD and ARC. We also offer research services to unrelated third parties on a contract basis, which we offer under the trademark POLARITYRD. Contract research services help us defray the costs of maintaining a first-rate research facility and allow us to meet companies pursuing new technologies that may be opportunities for collaborative or strategic relationships going forward.
 
Limitations to Clinical Standards of Care, Regenerative Technologies and Tissue Substitutes 
 
Clinical Standards of Care for Tissue Replacement
 
While both the literature and current practice indicate that the clinical standard of care remains the replacement of “like with like” (i.e. skin for skin, bone for bone, cartilage for cartilage), to date, many regenerative technologies, tissue engineered products and wound care products, have focused on “large scale manufacturable materials” and “off the shelf” designs, as opposed to employing a more patient-specific approach. Many of these types of products are xenografts, allografts, or alloplasts in part to allow for abundant sources of raw materials for the products. We believe these products merely act as synthetic cell/tissue substitutes, which are incapable of delivering true regeneration or regenerative potential of complex tissue systems and, therefore, why such products continue to fail to deliver results that are comparable to an autologous tissue graft (i.e. skin graft, bone graft, cartilage grafts etc.).

We believe that historically the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and, to some extent, cell-therapy have remained characterized by tremendous potential and promise for the future yet continue to remain limited by the pursuit of “artificial and/or synthetic” approaches that are overly reductionist, and thus fail to deliver “complete systems.” Some current regenerative medicine approaches try to isolate a single cellular population to regenerate a tissue, such as adipose-derived stem cells. Others try to deliver a molecule to manipulate cell function, such as driving cell growth and expansion, or coax one cell type to become another. Another approach tries to create some form of a scaffold that resembles the target tissue with specific properties designed to mimic that tissue. We believe these approaches incorrectly focus on the synthesis or engineering of singularities (i.e., a type of cell, a type of molecule, or type of matrix) in an attempt to build a complex tissue from the ground up, which we believe creates an incomplete system without interactions, diverse cells and molecules, or a natural environment to direct organization.
 
Real Limitations: Using Skin as an Example
 
Current clinical standards and practice adhere to the concept that skin should be replaced with skin whenever possible in settings where patients have suffered the loss of such tissue. Understanding this, medical professionals are left with a decision to attempt to temporize a wound bed with an allograft, use the patient’s own skin in a skin graft, or apply a variety of skin substitutes to provide a skin-like barrier while the margin of the wound heals through secondary intention and contraction. Presently, harvest and placement of autologous full-thickness skin results in the best outcome within wound beds because it most closely resembles the full-thickness skin that was lost. However, full-thickness harvest of skin inherently also results in a full-thickness skin defect at the donor site, which requires primary closure (skin edge approximation and suturing) so as not to leave a gaping wound behind. Because of this absolute limit on how much autologous full-thickness donor skin can be harvested without leaving behind a non-closable wound, medical professionals can only harvest small elliptically-shaped pieces of such skin from areas of redundancy which is termed full-thickness skin graft (FTSG).
 
It is because there remains only a finite supply of FTSG donor material and sites that medical professionals often rely on the harvest of split-thickness skin grafts (STSG) for coverage of voids of the integument to get better coverage and more skin. STSGs, however, do not represent the true anatomy or function of native skin because such graft harvest procedures only take the top 1/10,000th of an inch of the patient’s own skin and therefore do not capture all the necessary cellular and tissue elements and structures required for the regeneration of normal skin (Figure I).
 

Figure I. Common Site Locations for Skin Graft Harvesting. The left figure depicts the process and common location of where a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is harvested from with a vibrating razor that shaves off the very top 1/10,000th of an inch of skin as depicted in the skin cross section. STSGs are often then meshed (pocked with holes like a screen door) to allow for improved stretch over surfaces and to permit fluid drainage to pass through the graft and avoid build up under the graft like a bubble. The right figure depicts the common sites where full-thickness skin grafts are harvested from patients. Note that these areas are often hidden in anatomic locations where there are creases or folds to place the resulting scar from primary linear closure in aesthetically considerate places.

After the failure to harvest all the necessary structures, cellular elements and tissue interfaces from the STSG donor site, the patient is left with an incomplete top layer of skin covering the initial defect (recipient site) and a remaining bottom layer at the donor site. In this setting, both donor and recipient sites contain incomplete skin, which results in dysfunctional, painful scar tissues and lifelong morbidities.
 
Because of the limits of STSG and FTSG and the type of procedures required for such harvests, industry has continued to investigate skin substitutes and skin alternatives that can be used in place of native cutaneous substrate. Among these alternatives or options are a culture form of manipulated autograft, allograft, xenograft, and alloplast. None of these substitutes have been able to replicate the appearance of native skin or regenerate full-thickness skin or the cutaneous appendages (hair follicle, sweat gland, sebaceous glands, etc.), which are necessary for the development of full-thickness, functionally polarized, hierarchically organized skin.
 
The forgoing skin example shows that the traditional approach to regenerative medicine that competitors employ is anchored within tissue engineering algorithms that—while cost-effective because of mass production and scalability—are incongruent with living cells, dynamic tissues, and reactive systems, and, therefore, fail to produce outcomes that effectively heal and alleviate suffering.
 
Our Solution
 
We believe that our bio-generative SCIRM technology platforms are fundamentally new and inherently promote a drastically different approach to current conventional cell therapy efforts, regenerative technologies, and current products. Therapeutic singularities such as a single stem cell, a single growth factor, a single scaffold, or a combination of such singularities are unable to engineer a complex tissue in vitro for subsequent deployment into living systems. Recognizing the complexity of tissue regeneration as absolutely requiring cell-to-cell and cell-to-tissue polarity, interfaces, gradients, modulation, and multiplex system interactivity and real-time integration, we embrace a substantially more complete form of tissue regeneration that is biologically sound and evolutionarily cohesive with the dynamics of living systems.
 
We have designed and developed an entirely new form of regenerative cell/tissue therapy platform based on SCIRMs organized in complex MPFUs that when deployed into a wound or tissue defect undergo integrative regenerative healing within the system in which it was deployed by effectively acting as its own bioreactor and thus expanding, proliferating, and synthesizing those cells, materials, factors, and systems necessary for full-thickness generation and regeneration across a spectrum of tissue substrates and organ systems.
 
Our technology platform is based on complex living tissue systems and the interfaces that drive cell-tissue-matrix polarization events. We recognize there is something powerful, reactive, and dynamic controlling tissue generation, which is the interactome; the whole set of interactions a cell is impacted by, both intra and extra-cellularly. Cells rarely act on their own to create functional repair or regeneration, but rather tissues have functionally-organized cellular aggregates called appendages (almost like small organs), which run, and even regenerate, the composite tissues they are a part of when altered, stimulated, and processed in certain ways.
 
We believe each person’s cells and tissues have vastly different and dynamic profiles (genes, RNA, proteins, metabolites, etc.) and, therefore, different requirements when it comes to the regenerative potential or healing capacity of tissue-based systems. With this in mind, we designed our core “TE” platform technology to focus not on singularities, but on regenerating complete tissue systems.
 
Our core “TE” platform and self-complexing intelligent regenerative materials technologies are based on our ability to create MPFUs, which contain polarizing multi-cellular aggregates capable of expanding, proliferating, and synthesizing those cells, materials, factors or systems we believe are necessary for integrative full-thickness three-dimensional tissue regeneration, not simply two-dimensional cell sheets. Instead of starting with artificial materials, synthetic factors, or altered cell suspensions, our platform begins with the patient’s own (autologous) tissue and those components, appendages and substrates we believe are necessary for the development of an expandable and self-propagating complete system. The key attributes of our platform technology include the following:
 

● | Patient-Generated Cell Source: The human body often identifies and rejects foreign cells, creating the potential for tissue rejection, additional surgery, and foreign or allogeneic body reactions like residual scarring. We address this by using healthy autologous tissue taken from the patient to regenerate cells and tissues that the body identifies as “self” rather than foreign. Our goal is to allow a recipient to receive our product and generate new tissue without triggering an allogeneic, or foreign tissue, rejection.

● | Stem Cell Niche Utilization for Self-Propagating and Self-Organizing Functional Tissues: We utilize techniques for capturing the “stem cell niche,” the microenvironment within a tissue that interacts with stem cells to signal cell growth, development, renewal, and differentiation. While the stem cell niche historically has often been left behind by the commonly used split-thickness autograft methodology, we believe that it is necessary for the regeneration of functional tissue. Without the stem cell niche, we believe new tissue will form a scar and lose the functionality of the original tissue from which it was regenerated. By including the stem cell niche within the autologous tissue that is harvested, we believe the natural function of the small piece of tissue is preserved as it regenerates into a larger piece that can fill the patient’s targeted tissue. This is designed to minimize painful scarring, lesions, and other growth anomalies that often accompany autologous regeneration without the stem cell niche. This design approach also allows regeneration of the tissue’s normal layers and appendages and provides full-tissue coverage without relying on secondary surgery or in-growth of the surrounding tissue. We believe inclusion of the stem cell niche allows us to regenerate tissue with its naturally complex layers intact.

● | Polarity Maintenance and Enhancement to Harness Stem Cell Niche Regeneration: A cell’s polarity refers to its interactive communication with neighboring cells, including the direction in which a cell should grow. This enables cells and tissues to carry out specialized functions. Our platform carefully maintains and enhances the polarity of the stem cell niche to harness its regenerative capacity by mirroring the way tissue develops in the human body. By maintaining and enhancing the polarity of regenerating tissue, our platform is designed to preserve the natural cell and three-dimensional tissue structure, and thereby the functionality of regenerated tissues and appendages. 
● | The Person as the Bioreactor: Instead of using a manufactured or engineered environment to support the regenerative process, our platform uses the human body as a bioreactor by applying our product to the patient and allowing regeneration to occur there. We believe this allows the patient’s own body to provide the ideal nutrients and extracellular environment for controlled healing of the regenerative tissue. This approach also reduces turnaround time for delivering product to the patient, as our manufacturing process does not involve growing cells in an industrial, synthetic bioreactor. In addition, utilization of the patient as the bioreactor during cellular tissue propagation further reduces relative costs, which are passed onto patients, providers, and payor systems. 
● | Reducing Barriers ~ Arming More Healthcare Providers with Tangible and Pragmatic Technologies: We believe that novel technologies must thrive in the trenches of medicine and be easily utilized by a full spectrum of providers to truly deliver value and make an impact in patients’ lives. We recognize that a technology that is limited by who can administer it or setting of care where it can be used creates barriers and limits access to those who need it. Our goal is to design and develop therapies, technologies and products which overcome these limits by delivering new standards of care, which are easily utilized by ALL providers, across ALL settings of care. 

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our key competitive strengths include the following:
 
Pursuing the Development of a Complete System that Rivals the Clinical Standard of Care: We believe that we have designed and developed a technology platform that may displace the current clinical standard of care in complex tissue regeneration, reconstruction and/or replacement efforts. Currently, the clinical standard of care for the reconstruction of complex tissue voids relies on autologous tissue transplantation. For example, critical defects of the skin, bone, cartilage and other tissues are most appropriately treated through the autologous graft or flap coverage. While these efforts remain the clinical standard of care in most settings, such processes result simply in the transplantation of tissue from one area of the body to another region. Such movement of autologous tissue materials often provides “coverage” but does not result in significant expansion of the cellular entities or tissue substrates. After the limited ability to expand beyond 1:1 – 1:4 ratios, donor site size and morbidity must be taken into consideration when harvesting autologous tissues. Understanding these limitations that exist within the clinical standard of care, we have sought to design and develop an autologous tissue that requires minimal donor site and can be significantly expanded on the patients themselves.

Novel Platform Technology. Our technology platform deploys activated MPFUs into a wound or other tissue defect with the goal of regenerating fully-functional, polarized tissues and hierarchically organized tissue structures. We design the MPFUs to facilitate the expansion, proliferation, and synthesis of the cells, materials, factors, and systems that we believe are necessary for complete, full-thickness generation and regeneration across a spectrum of tissue substrates and organ systems. Rather than relying on a single stem cell, growth factor, or scaffold, we believe that complex tissue regeneration requires a dynamic composite cellular interface to engineer a complex tissue that is expected to integrate into living systems. We design our core tissue substrate materials to create complex functional living tissue systems in a way that mirrors natural healing in the body and is not seen as foreign by the immune system. We believe our platform technology will produce superior outcomes for providers and patients.
 
Deep Pipeline of Additional Potential Applications. We believe our platform’s capabilities can be extended across many indications, including skin, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, and neural elements, as well as solid and hollow organ composite tissue systems. For example, we believe there are currently unmet medical needs that can be addressed by the regeneration of cartilage for the treatment of osteoarthritis and facial reconstruction, the regeneration of fat-for-fat transfers during plastic surgery procedures, the regeneration of nerves following traumatic loss, the regeneration of blood vessels for vascular grafts, the regeneration of the urogenital epithelium and submucosa for urethral strictures and bladder reconstruction following tumor removal, the regeneration of liver tissue for liver fibrosis or failure, and the regeneration of bowel tissue to prevent leaking where the bowel is reconnected or replaced due to excessive loss from trauma, surgery, or congenital defects. We believe the significant number of product opportunities afforded by our platform will generate sustainable growth opportunity.
 
Shortened Product Development Timelines. Since our core TE product candidates all stem from a common platform technology, we believe we can accelerate research and development, pre-clinical model prototyping, and product development in a manner that is efficient and optimized across tissue substrates.
 
Scalable Manufacturing and Distribution Capability. Because we believe our technology can be applied across a variety of tissue substrates, we believe we are able to prototype, model, and develop products for commercialization relatively quickly. We have developed flexible manufacturing processes, systems, and facilities that we believe can allow us to quickly respond to increases in demand and market forces. Because we believe we can apply our technology to many types of tissue and organ systems, we believe we can effectively scale and reproduce the manufacturing and distribution of multiple pipeline products at the same time. In addition, we believe we can leverage our platform technology to create a variety of substrate sub-platforms and related technology derivative arms, which can act either as additive technologies to core TE products, or as stand-alone products. We believe we may also be able to integrate our technology with other off-the-shelf products (e.g., to cellularize an acellular scaffold or function with existing dressings).
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Complete the full commercial launch of SkinTE and establish SkinTE as an improvement over the standard of care for skin tissue injuries, including wounds, burns, and scars. We believe that SkinTE has the potential to supplant prevailing methods of wound and burn care because, unlike existing treatment options, it is designed to regenerate full-thickness skin using small samples of the patient’s own tissue. Rather than being limited by dimensions of the tissue received, SkinTE is designed to regenerate significantly beyond the sample size. Our regional commercial rollout of SkinTE commenced in late October 2018, and is focused on severe wounds and burn patients at key regional centers as, in our experience, these patients are often in critical need of large areas of skin regrowth and may have limited available healthy skin to use for skin grafts. Along with the treatment of severe wounds and burns, we intend to market SkinTE for chronic wounds, surgical reconstruction events, including cosmetic and elective surgeries, and for scar revision or the removal of dysfunctional events.
 
Based on our internal analysis of annual patient volumes and relative wound sizes, we estimate the annual addressable markets within the United States for burn wounds, surgical reconstruction and traumatic wounds, and chronic wounds are $3 billion, $23 billion, and $24 billion, respectively. These markets are largely contained within the approximately 127 burn centers, 600 level I-III trauma centers, and greater than 2,000 wound care centers and clinics within the United States.

Capitalize on our scalable manufacturing capabilities and the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway to commercialize additional pipeline products quickly and efficiently. In addition to SkinTE, we are actively preparing and advancing two additional TE core products, OsteoTE and CartTE, for FDA registration using the 361 HCT/P pathway that does not require FDA approval prior to market entry. Our current expectation is to rely on the versatility of our platform technology, the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway, and our scalable manufacturing capability to develop and launch these two new products over the next two years. 
 
Explore partnership or collaboration opportunities for pipeline candidates, as well as potential acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary product candidates. We are actively exploring the possibility of partnership or collaboration opportunities with third parties, which we believe could be used to facilitate the commercial adoption of our pipeline candidates worldwide or in certain territories. We are selectively evaluating the formation of collaborative alliances, product licensure and distribution agreements, and integrated product offerings, as well as opportunities to accelerate the commercialization and development of our products. In the future, we also expect to consider the acquisition or in-license of complementary product candidates.
 
SkinTE 
 
General
 
Our first product, SkinTE, is registered with the FDA and is now commercially available for treatment of defects of the skin. SkinTE is created from a small piece of the patient’s own tissue, which is extracted and then manufactured using our proprietary technology platform to expand and regenerate full-thickness, fully functional skin with what we believe to be the critical layers, including epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, and appendages including hair follicles and glands. Each application of SkinTE is patient-specific and designed for a single deployment. We believe SkinTE offers a compelling alternative to current standards of care for skin regeneration.
 
PolarityTE designed SkinTE for use by physicians and other healthcare professionals in the treatment of patients who have suffered from an event, disease, or process, or who have an acquired defect that has resulted in the functional loss or absence of the skin. Specifically, SkinTE is designed for the treatment of chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, acute wounds, chronic burn wounds or scars, acute burn wounds, scars of the integument, and defects from medical or surgical resection or reconstruction events that require skin coverage. According to a 2015 report from MedMarket Diligence, LLC, more than 250 million wounds are expected globally by 2020. And according to Statistics MRC’s 2016 Global Regenerative Medicine Market Outlook, the global market for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering is expected to grow to $101.3 billion by 2020.
 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, we established the product logistics, interactions with hospitals, and our clinical operations and market access teams, so that we can handle all aspects of manufacturing and commercializing an autologous skin product. During this limited market release we serviced over 50 patients. We have no reported adverse reactions from any of the applications of SkinTE. We hired our first sales force and have been building out our first regional release since October 2018. The full national release of SkinTE is planned for 2019.
 
SkinTE is registered as a 361 HCT/P with the FDA pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR 1271. An HCT/P is defined as an article containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. Products that qualify as 361 HCT/Ps are not subject to the FDA’s pre-market clearance or approval requirements, but rather can be immediately listed for commercial use with the FDA and are then subject to post-market regulatory requirements such as compliance with current good tissue practices (cGTP), adverse event and deviation reporting, and post-market inspections by the FDA. For more information on the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway, please see “Government Regulation” and “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Registration or Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Government Regulations.”

Our Wound, Burn and Skin Reconstruction Treatment Solution – SkinTE
 
We described in detail above the real limitations of the standard of care in tissue regeneration as applied to skin. We designed SkinTE to address the limitations from which current wound and burn treatment methods suffer. We designed SkinTE to combine the advantages of autologous STSGs with those of FTSGs. Notably, SkinTE is designed to provide not only the large surface area treatment capability of STSGs, but also the restoration and smaller, less morbid donor site associated with FTSGs. In essence, we believe our minimally manipulated SkinTE product can provide an expandable form of a FTSG.
 
To our knowledge, SkinTE is the only fully autologous, homologous skin regeneration product available for the treatment of wounds and functional losses of the skin of human patients. We face competition from providers of FTSGs and STSGs, as well as other companies developing and selling skin substitutes. We are aware of several companies focused on the wound market, including Avita Medical, Integra LifeSciences, Wright Medical Group, MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Allosource, MTF Biologics and Vericel. Any advances in regenerative medicine by a competitor may be used to develop therapies competing against SkinTE. However, to our knowledge SkinTE is the only fully autologous homologous skin regeneration product available for the treatment of wounds and functional losses of skin that enables the patient to regenerate his or her own skin with all the functions of full thickness skin, including hair, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, capillary beds, and all layers of skin, including epidermis, dermis, hypodermis, and subdermal fat. We believe SkinTE produces a superior result for patients that challenges the current standard of care and the therapies offered by other companies in the wound care market.
 
SkinTE is composed of small viable cellular and tissue-based units, which we call MPFUs, that retain all the components of skin that we believe are required to regenerate full-thickness skin. The initial processes underlying the function of SkinTE are analogous to those responsible for the healing of an autologous skin graft, namely imbibition, inosculation, and neo-vascularization. During imbibition, SkinTE, and the small cellular and tissue based units that comprise it, survive through the direct application of the SkinTE “paste” on the wound bed, exchanging nutrients and waste within the fluid of the wound bed. Inosculation is the stage in which the capillaries and blood vessels already present within the wound bed begin to align and connect with those present within the graft. Neovascularization marks the ingrowth of new blood vessels into the wound bed and out of the graft, with vasculogenesis describing the formation of new vessels from cellular precursors present within the wound and graft, and angiogenesis referring to the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existing ones. Due to their size and composition, we design the small cellular and tissue based units within SkinTE to have reduced metabolic demand and to be capable of surviving through diffusion, and to readily excrete metabolic waste, resulting in what we believe can be less ischemic damage when compared to FTSGs. Reduction in ischemic damage has the potential to decrease scar formation and provide a more functional result. Following completion of the initial stages of integrating and healing within the wound bed, the SkinTE product is designed to begin forming and organizing discrete areas of full-thickness skin. We have observed in preclinical animal testing that these regenerative centers of full-thickness skin then expand out radially across the wound, eventually coalescing with each other and the margins of the wound.
 
Unlike the currently marketed skin substitutes of which we are aware, each SkinTE tissue-product is derived entirely from the patient’s own skin and is not combined with any other tissue-engineered substitutes. We believe these differences allow SkinTE to regenerate all the important layers of the skin as well as the necessary cutaneous appendages for the development of functionally-polarized, hierarchically organized autologous, homologous skin.
 
The SkinTE Process
 

SkinTE is designed as an all-in-one system to make the process as simple and efficient as possible for the user—whether that individual is a surgeon, medical doctor, physician assistant or nurse in an operating room, wound clinic, emergency department, doctor’s office or forward operating military base. When a new clinical center or practice is activated to begin using our SkinTE product, we ship a supply of all-inclusive harvest boxes (see the image furthest to the left above) to the facility for convenient on-site, off-the-shelf storage for that user and facility. Each harvest box contains all the materials and instruments needed to perform the relatively standard skin excision procedure to obtain the tissue sample, and all the pre-paid/pre-completed shipping labels, and a one-touch, cool pack shipping box that maintains the temperature within the harvest box as it is delivered to a PolarityTE biomedical manufacturing facility.

At our manufacturing facility, we use proprietary techniques to create a paste-like product from the small piece of healthy patient tissue that preserves the original tissue’s microenvironment and allows new cells to integrate into existing, healthy cells, with similarly organized assembly and interface development. Following manufacturing at our facility, the SkinTE product is shipped back to the provider at a time that best suits the patient and provider’s scheduling and location needs (i.e., operating room, procedure clinic, in-patient bedside, out-patient doctor’s office). Our goal is to be able to return the ready-to-use SkinTE product to physicians as early as the same day. We have observed, however, that most physician requests have been for return within 24-72 hours from tissue harvest. At application time, once the patient wound bed is prepared per clinical guidelines, SkinTE is dispensed onto the surface of the wound bed (see the image in the middle above). The wound is dressed using a non-adherent, occlusive, non-absorbent dressing placed directly over the SkinTE product (see the image furthest to the right above), with recommended dressings that we include in the deployment box.


 
To assist physicians and other medical providers in using SkinTE, we developed a web application called the PolarityTE 24-Hour Real-Time Assistant, or the RTA, which permits experienced and medically trained PolarityTE physicians and staff to provide real-time support through a customer’s computer or smart phone. The RTA permits HIPAA-compliant direct calling, video chat, text, emails, and data sharing. Through the RTA, our customers can also track their packages and submit forms. We also use the RTA to gain advanced visibility into daily manufacturing requirements and product flow.
 
Selling SkinTE
 
In 2018, we completed the first two stages of our SkinTE commercial roll-out strategy. The first was the limited market release phase, which focused on generating trial/ utilization with the goal of securing real-world clinical data and experience to prepare the organization and product for a broader commercial release. The second stage was the regional market release that began in late October 2018 with the additional build out of our commercial organization to establish SkinTE with major burn and trauma centers across the United States. Each hospital targeted requires an assessment by their Value Analysis Committee (VAC) prior to commencing commercial SkinTE deployment. This is a formal process that can take approximately 4-6 months to complete. After VAC approval, terms of the SkinTE purchase agreement are finalized and patient identification and treatment initiates, which can take several months.
 
Once purchase agreements are in place, our sales team and clinical operations staff maintain close contact with the facility to support the initial therapeutic applications of SkinTE. Due to the transformational nature of the product, this relationship helps to ensure the facility’s ability to effectively incorporate SkinTE into their existing burn or wound management protocols.

The selling process to achieve an initial sale averages between six and nine months. The sales process is affected by several factors, including the incidence and nature of burn and wound care cases at target accounts and the receptiveness of the health care providers to adopt a new therapeutic approach.
 
Once the first deployment of SkinTE has occurred, there is generally a delay before subsequent deployments at the same facility. The timeframe is typically between three and six months, as we have found physicians appear to pause until the clinical outcome of the first application can be fully appreciated. To help decrease the time between the first and second deployment, we are actively pursuing multiple randomized controlled clinical trials to further illustrate SkinTE clinical outcomes and overall value proposition. Furthermore, as SkinTE gains in utilization and acceptance by health care providers, the lead time to first sale should decrease as information on SkinTE and clinical results are more broadly disseminated in the medical community.
 
SkinTE is billed by the square centimeter size of the skin defect to be treated, as is standard for skin wound treatments. Because SkinTE is created from the patient’s own tissue, we can price below other treatment options like skin substitutes. Unlike other treatment options, SkinTE can deliver permanent, functional full-thickness skin replacement with only one application, compared to the multiple procedure regimens common for split-thickness skin grafts, full-thickness skin grafts, autograft, allograft, and alloplast therapies.
 
Payment and Reimbursement
 
Inpatient Setting. In the inpatient setting, facility reimbursement is dictated by the associated bundled Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment for the entire episode of care under the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The bundled DRG facility payment is determined by the DRG code applied, which factors in the primary diagnosis and patient characteristics, such as co-morbidities present on admission. In this scenario, all products and supplies utilized during the episode of care are paid for with the bundled DRG facility payment, including products like SkinTE. In addition, physician services are billed and reimbursed outside of the bundled DRG facility payment, including any procedures performed during that admission, which are billed for and reimbursed utilizing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes associated with the respective procedures. SkinTE has been used within the inpatient setting and reimbursed underneath the applicable DRG bundled facility payments, and to our knowledge all associated procedures billed for outside the DRG as physician services with CPT codes have been reimbursed, as well.
 
Hospital Outpatient Department (HOPD) and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Setting. Like the inpatient setting, bundled Ambulatory Classification Payment (APC) facility payments are received under the Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) for services and supplies utilized during episodes of care within Hospital Outpatient Departments (HOPDs) and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs). In these settings, bundled APC facility payments are dictated by the procedure(s) performed and billed for through the appropriate CPT codes. SkinTE has been used in these settings and covered with the associated bundled APC facility payments and physician services have been paid for outside of the APC payment utilizing CPT codes to bill for the associated procedures. In addition, we are working towards applying for pass-through status, which would allow SkinTE to be billed for outside of the bundled APC facility payment.
 
Office or Clinic Setting. In contrast to the inpatient, HOPD, and ASC settings, care provided in a physician office or clinic is reimbursed based on individual Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and CPT codes, facilitating reimbursement for the specific products utilized and procedures performed during the clinic visit. The CPT codes used in the setting are the same or similar to the CPT codes used to bill for physician services in the other settings of care. In 2018, providers utilized HCPCS Q code 4100 (skin substitute not otherwise specified) to bill for the use of SkinTE in the office. Of the providers that used SkinTE in the office or clinic setting throughout 2018, to our knowledge all were reimbursed utilizing Q4100. Early in 2018 we filed an application with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for a unique HCPCS SkinTE Q code. We were successful and received Q code 4200, which was effective January 1, 2019. Therefore, beginning January 1, 2019, providers using SkinTE in the office or clinic setting can use Q4200, the unique SkinTE specific Q code, when billing for the product. Reimbursement rates in the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Payment System (HOPPS) vary based on whether the product is designated a low-cost product or high cost product. Assignment is based on average selling Price (ASP) as reported to CMS. New Q codes with limited ASP on file with CMS are automatically assigned to the low-cost product category. We reported our first ASP in October 2018, so SkinTE’s Q code will initially be designated a low-cost product limiting the reimbursement to $483 for a single application in a clinic setting. We will continue to report ASP and work with CMS on this process because we believe that SkinTE can qualify as a high-cost product reimbursable at $1,548 for a single application in a clinic setting.

Clinical Studies
 
We initiated a head-to-head trial comparing SkinTE to the split-thickness skin graft, the clinical standard of care, in the first quarter of 2018. Enrollment is in progress and we expect it will be completed in 2019. In parallel with this clinical trial, we have been accumulating clinical results on non-trial patients from our market release for application of SkinTE for various indications, including acute burn, burn reconstruction, surgical reconstruction, scar revision, and chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous stasis ulcers. Some of these cases have been presented independently by, or in collaboration with, providers at national conferences including the 2018 American Professional Wound Care Association Conference, the 2018 Diabetic Foot Global Conference; 2018 American Society of Plastic Surgery - The Meeting; 2018 Symposium on Advanced Wound Care; and, the 2018 Innovations in Wound Healing. We believe peer-reviewed publication of these results will occur in 2019. Following very encouraging pilot results, preparations are underway to list on clinicaltrials.gov and enroll patients in two separate randomized controlled trials in diabetic foot ulcers and venous stasis ulcers, which constitute the most common causes of chronic lower extremity wounds that affect over a million Americans. These trials will each treat over 100 patients, compare SkinTE to the standard of care, and evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of a single application of SkinTE providing important reimbursement information for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and outpatient applications. These will be multi-center trials that will enroll throughout 2019.
 
OsteoTE
 
We applied our platform technology to develop OsteoTE, our autologous, homologous bone regeneration product. OsteoTE is designed to utilize the patient’s own bone to target applications for bone repair, reconstruction, replacement, supplementation, and regeneration, including in the long bone (hard, dense bones that provide structure, strength and mobility such as the femur or humerus), craniomaxillofacial, spine, dental, hand, and foot/ankle markets. As with skin, we believe existing treatments for the repair of bone with autologous grafts suffer from significant limitations that we can address with OsteoTE. We have conducted several preclinical large animal studies using established bone treatment models, including critical-sized cranial bone defects and spinal fusion models. The preclinical results for OsteoTE are very encouraging and parallel the results seen with SkinTE – the ability to regenerate complex tissues recapitulating the structure and function of the native tissue from which it was created. Below are preliminary images of OsteoTE bone regeneration in a preclinical model of a cranial defect.

Based on our internal analysis of the Truven Health Analytics Market Scan Research Database, there were approximately 1.9 million addressable orthopedic cases in the United States, including patients suffering from pathology of the femur, radius, ulna, tibia, fibula, or humerus. We believe OsteoTE can be deployed in numerous indications in the Craniomaxillofacial, Foot and Ankle, Hand and Wrist, Hip and Pelvis, Spine, Long Bone and Dental markets. Each of these markets presents a potential multi-billion dollar market opportunity for OsteoTE. According to a report issued by the research firm MarketsandMarkets, the global spinal fusion and implant market is expected to reach $17.3 billion by 2021, the global craniomaxillofacial implants market is expected to reach $2.5 billion by 2021, and the dental market is expected to reach $35.4 billion by 2021. We registered OsteoTE with the FDA as a 361 HCT/P tissue-based product in December 2018, and our goal is to commercialize OsteoTE through a phased release starting in early 2019.
 
CartTE
 
With our CartTE product candidate, we are aiming to deliver on a long-imagined product—one that can tackle the highly prevalent and debilitating process of osteoarthritis to delay or prevent the need for more invasive procedures, such as prosthetic joint replacement and reconstruction. Furthermore, we believe the autologous cartilage construct delivered with CartTE can be utilized in a variety of other applications, including facial reconstruction, facial aesthetics, hand reconstruction, as well as wrist reconstruction. We have initiated the preclinical studies needed to evaluate cartilage replacement in critical-sized defects and will continue to evaluate CartTE’s potential in various cartilage replacement indications.
 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is estimated to affect 9% of the US population greater than 30 years of age, with costs of treatment totaling $28.6 billion in 2013, according to a review by Grande et al. Market projections by Krutz et al. in 2007 predict that the demand for primary (first-time) total hip and knee replacements will grow to 572,000 and 3.48 million procedures per year by 2030 in the US, respectively. In contrast to the staggering number of patients suffering from osteoarthritis and those pursuing joint replacement, the cartilage repair and regeneration market is only estimated to reach $6.7 billion by 2025, according to a Cartilage Repair/Regeneration Market Analysis report by Grand View Research. This lopsided market, in which cartilage repair and regeneration only captures a small fraction of the patient population that could benefit from articular cartilage regeneration, demonstrates a significant opportunity for our autologous cartilage regeneration product, CartTE, to displace the current trends and standards of care, delivering the regenerative medicine product that has remained elusive until now.
 
Additional Core TE Product Candidates
 
In addition, we intend to continue developing:
 

● | AdipoTE to optimize the delivery of autologous fat beyond the capabilities of current fat transfer techniques utilized in procedures on, among others, the breast, buttocks, and face. In 2016, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, approximately 100,000 fat transfer procedures were performed when combining the breast, buttocks, and face, including a 41% increase in fat transfers to the breast (American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AngioTE to address vascular regeneration including microscopic capillary networks all the way up to great vessel replacement. Approximately 400,000 coronary bypass grafts are performed per year in the US according to the CDC. In addition, 650,000 patients per year in the US and 2 million patients per year worldwide are affected by end stage renal disease (ESRD), who may benefit from placement of hemodialysis access, including arteriovenous fistula creation. 


12

● | NeuralTE for peripheral nerve injuries of the extremities, as well as for patients with neuromas or chronic compression due to joint replacements, migraines, craniofacial injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, and those who have undergone hernia or abdominal-based procedures; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | UroTE targeting the delivery of autologous urogenital epithelium and submucosa across a spectrum of diseases and processes, including urethral strictures, urethral creation, bladder reconstruction, and ureter reconstruction; 
● | LiverTE to address numerous causes of liver failure, including NASH, fibrosis/cirrhosis, surgical resection of the liver. According to the CDC, 1.6% of US adults are diagnosed with liver disease, which fails to recognize the portion that are at risk of liver disease, or those with distant metastases within their liver that may undergo resection of a significant portion of the organ. 
● | BowelTE to deliver an optimized autologous construct to aid in the regeneration of bowel tissue. According to the CDC, approximately 10 million outpatient procedures and 6 million inpatient procedures were performed on the digestive system in 2010. Anyone undergoing surgical repair or anastomosis of the bowel could potentially benefit from a product delivering bowel regeneration. 

 
We believe a number of the product candidates described above will be suitable for marketing via the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway. If we successfully register and list a product with the FDA using the 361 HCT/P pathway, we plan to deploy a commercialization strategy that is like that for SkinTE. Any products not suitable for the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway will need to go through the FDA pre-market approval process, which usually involves the filing, as applicable, of an Investigational New Drug Application or Biologics License Application that will require further preclinical and clinical testing and substantially extend the time of bringing the product to market.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not separately engineer individual manufacturing processes around each individual tissue product. Rather, we design, develop, and adapt our core “TE” products and product candidates to a common manufacturing process that allows us to establish fast, effective, and cost-efficient systems. Adopting a common manufacturing process enhances our production capacity and expansion strategy, and at the same time potentially reduces our cost of goods sold.
 
We have designed and developed manufacturing processes and quality systems that allow us to receive a specimen, qualify the incoming tissue, process and manufacture the cell/tissue product, and perform outgoing quality control and quality assurance work prior to shipping. We believe that our ultra-clean dual-barrier system, which involves clean room structures containing fully-isolated and air-locked internal ISO 4 containment systems, allows us to move specimen and product in an efficient manner, while maintaining protective quality systems.
 
We have designed our scalable manufacturing process to allow us to be flexible and agile in real-time, while allowing us to shift resources daily to meet acute production needs as well as respond to larger factors, including market forces, multi-facility buildouts, and changes in rapidly evolving technology platforms. In designing our products and systems, we focused both on being able to meet market demand and to scale manufacturing. We believe that we have designed our manufacturing clean dual-barrier system to be efficient in flow processes, column production, and scalability. In compliance with ISO standards and cGTP, our repeating clean manufacturing column systems and fully-isolated and air-locked internal ISO 4 containment units are engineered and designed with scalable production in mind.
 
We currently operate a facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, consisting of approximately 178,528 square feet. We use this facility for product manufacturing and research and development work. We intend to establish over time remote manufacturing facilities we call “nodes” at locations close to health care providers we believe will be significant purchasers of our products. One of the significant benefits of nodes is the creation of manufacturing redundancy, so that production can be sustained if one of our manufacturing facilities is unable to produce due to natural disaster or other cause. We also believe nodes have the potential to lower shipping costs, which would improve our gross margin on products sold in the areas where the nodes are located.

Suppliers
 
As part of our strategy of ensuring timely delivery of our products, we have avoided relying on any third-party supplier as a sole source vendor for any element of our production process. In the past year, we have signed agreements with major suppliers to reduce costs, ensure faster fulfillment, and increase our bulk purchasing capability. We have identified alternate suppliers and, where appropriate, supply alternatives for any sourcing challenges.
Intellectual Property
 
As we advance our platform technology, our RTA, and our RTDs, we seek to apply a multilayered approach for protecting intellectual property relating to our innovation – with patents (utility and design), copyrights, trademarks, as well as know-how and trade secret protection.
 
We do not currently own any granted patents, but have a number of patent applications pending in the U.S. and around the world. We have four pending U.S. non-provisional utility patent applications relating to MPFUs – U.S. Serial Nos. 14/954,335; 15/650,656; 15/650,659; and 16/165,169. Each of these applications claims priority to a U.S. provisional application filed on December 2, 2014. We have one Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) International Patent Application (PCT International Publication No. WO 2016/089825) and national phase applications have been entered in OAIP, ARIPO, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Eurasia, Europe, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Vietnam. These applications, as well as our pending non-public applications (which will only be identified after publication), are proceeding along the normal timeline of patent office examination in each respective country. The receipt of office actions from patent offices is part of the examination process, as is our response to such office actions. To date, no application has been abandoned or lapsed. Nor has any application been rejected in a manner that forecloses the possibility of receiving a granted patent from that same application. All our patent applications are currently alive and actively being pursued. We cannot predict when or where the first set of patent claims might be granted, nor can we speculate on the scope of claims in such a future patent.
 
We seek to complement the protection of our innovation with a portfolio of trademarks and service marks in the United States and around the world. The POLARITYTE trademark has been registered in the United States, Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Turkey. Additional registered trademarks in the United States include our logo, WELCOME TO THE SHIFT, and WHERE SELF REGENERATES SELF.
 
In striving to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, we also rely heavily on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology and on know-how. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
Competition
 
The regenerative medicine industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from companies developing and selling regenerative medicine products, as well as academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 

14
--


Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours (if required), which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 
RTD and ARC
 
We believe our TE platform technology is a revolutionary approach to regenerative medicine in and of itself, but we also find that it suggests new areas of inquiry and potential innovation. To this end, we have active research we are pursuing through our Related Technology Derivatives (RTD) and Advanced Research Center (ARC) programs. RTDs can be designed to augment the application and regenerative outcomes of our pipeline products or be used as standalone products. ARC programs focus on the improvement of RTDs as well as augmentation of our pipeline products. We are excited about the recent advancements in the field of gene therapy and are interested in the possibility of genetically altering our products, including SkinTE, to better treat and possibly cure rare diseases, such as Epidermolysis Bullosa, a genetic condition that causes the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily.
Contract Research Services
 
In May 2018, we purchased the assets of a preclinical research sciences business and related real estate from Ibex Group, L.L.C., a Utah limited liability company, and Ibex Preclinical Research, Inc., a Utah corporation. We acquired these assets to accelerate research and development of our TE product candidates, and now operate the business as IBEX to advance our product development and deliver preclinical research services to third parties. The business consists of a “good laboratory practices” (GLP) compliant preclinical research facility that is USDA registered and includes vivarium, operating rooms, preparation rooms, storage facilities, and surgical and imaging equipment. The real property includes two parcels in Logan, Utah, consisting of approximately 1.75 combined gross acres of land, together with the buildings, structures, fixtures, and personal property located on the real property.
 
PolarityTE RD offers a complimentary array of research services to those offered through IBEX, providing access to experimental planning, histology, and in vivo and in vitro imaging, including micro-ct. The PolarityTE RD arm is well equipped with state of the art equipment and sophisticated research staff that provide a range of services including veterinary and preclinical services, advanced imaging, biomedical engineering and validation, molecular biology assays and proteomics analyses.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities or laws and regulations in the United States and other countries regulate the manufacturing, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, and promotion of products such as those we have developed and are developing. Any product we are developing must comply with the standards required for the product category under which the product is classified by such government authorities or laws.
 
FDA Regulation of Tissue-Based Products
 
The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. In the United States, HCT/Ps are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FDA, depending on if they fall solely within the scope of Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHS Act”) (42 U.S.C. § 264) or if they are regulated as drugs, devices, or biological products under Section 351 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. § 262) or the FD&C Act.
 
If an HCT/P meets the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (so-called “361 HCT/Ps”), no premarket FDA review for safety and effectiveness under a drug, device, or biological product marketing application is required. However, the processor of the tissue is required to register and list its products with the FDA, comply with regulations regarding labeling, record keeping, donor eligibility and screening and testing, process the tissue in accordance with established current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP), and investigate and, in certain circumstances, report adverse events or deviations.
 

15
--


To be a 361 HCT/P, a product generally must meet all four of the following criteria:
 

● | It must be minimally manipulated; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It must be intended for homologous use; 
● | Its manufacture must not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent, provided the addition of such article does not raise new clinical safety concerns; and 
● | It must not have a systemic effect and must not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function (unless the product is intended for reproductive use, autologous use, or use in a first- or second-degree blood relative). 

 
We believe that SkinTE and OsteoTE qualify as 361 HCT/P tissue-based products, and believe that our core “TE” products in development (e.g., CartTE) will qualify as 361 HCT/Ps. Other products we are developing are being evaluated with respect to regulatory classification, and we will prepare for any pathway of manufacturing or regulation that is required.
 
All establishments that manufacture 361 HCT/Ps must register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) within five days after commencing operations. In addition, establishments are required to update their registration annually in December or within 30 days of certain changes, and submit changes in HCT/P listing at the time of or within six months of such change. Establishments that manufacture 361 HCT/Ps will know that they are registered in compliance with 21 C.F.R. § 1271.10(a) when they receive a validated form with the registration number (“FEI#”) after submitting the Form FDA 3356 (registration form). Current Good Tissue Practice (“cGTP”) requirements govern, as may be applicable, the facilities, controls, and methods used in the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including without limitation, recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution of 361 HCT/Ps. FDA inspection and enforcement with respect to establishments described in 21 C.F.R. § 1271 includes inspections conducted, as deemed necessary, to determine compliance with the applicable provisions and may include, but is not limited to, an assessment of the establishment’s facilities, equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, processes, HCT/Ps, procedures, labeling, records, files, papers, and controls required to be maintained under 21 C.F.R. § 1271. Such inspections can occur at any time with or without written notice at such frequency as is determined by the FDA in its sole discretion. Our Salt Lake City manufacturing site was inspected in July 2018 and we received certain inspectional observations on Form FDA 483 following that inspection. We responded to those observations and are continuing a productive dialog with the FDA.
 
If we fail to comply with the FDA regulations and laws applicable to our operation or tissue products, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, pursuing any of the following sanctions, among others:
 

● | Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, product seizures, and civil penalties; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Orders for product retention, recall, or destruction; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations; 
● | Refusing any requests for product clearance or approval; 
● | Withdrawing or suspending any applications for approval or approvals already granted; or 
● | Criminal prosecution.

Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 
We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and other potential referral sources for our products pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, and similar laws. In addition, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation. The Company could potentially face legal risks if our interpretation differs from those of enforcement authorities. Further, from time to time the Company may find itself at a competitive disadvantage if the Company’s interpretation differs from that of its competitors.
 
In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of, a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, except certain remuneration and remunerative arrangements from violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by Government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. Many states have laws similar to the federal law.
 
Also, the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant, and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity (i.e., a whistleblower) with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government and to be paid a portion of the government’s recovery, which can include both civil penalties and up to three times the amount of the government’s damages (usually the amount reimbursed by federal healthcare programs). The U.S. Department of Justice takes the position that the marketing and promotional practices of life sciences product manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products, the provision of inaccurate or misleading reimbursement guidance, or the payment of prohibited kickbacks, may cause the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid by health care providers that use the manufacturer’s products, which results in a violation of the FCA. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements (“CIAs”) that require, among other things, substantial government oversight, as well as reporting and remedial actions going forward
 
If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to:
 

● | Multi-year investigations by federal and state governments; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Criminal and civil fines and penalties; 
● | Obligations under settlement agreements, such as CIAs or Deferred Prosecution Agreements; or 
● | Exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. 

 
For more information on this fraud, abuse, and false claim risk, please see the discussion below, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the information under the heading, “We are subject to numerous federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete in the marketplace.”
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our research, development and tissue preservation activities generate some chemical and biomedical wastes, consisting primarily of diluted alcohols and acids, and human and animal pathological and biological wastes, including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures. The chemical and biomedical wastes generated by our research, development and tissue processing operations are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes. We contract with third parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of waste. We strive to remain compliant with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies.

Reimbursement
 
In the United States, demand for access to any medical product will depend in large part on both the availability and the amount of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and commercial healthcare insurers, including managed care organizations and other private health plans. Third-party payers have complex rules and requirements for coverage and reimbursement of healthcare products and services. Even the applications to such third-party payers to be eligible for reimbursement for product or services are complex and can be lengthy and time consuming. For new technologies coming to market, these payers are increasingly examining the clinical evidence supporting medical necessity and cost effectiveness decisions in addition to safety and efficacy, which can result in barriers to early coverage reimbursement, or denial of coverage and reimbursement altogether. Accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the availability of coverage and reimbursement status for new medical products. If third-party payer reimbursement is unavailable to our customer hospitals, physicians, and providers, our sales may be limited and we may not be able to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
Payers often set payment rates depending on the site of service and many use the Medicare program as a benchmark for their own payment methodologies. In the hospital inpatient setting, Medicare payment generally is set at pre-determined rates for all products and services provided during a patient stay, and is based on such factors as the patient diagnosis, procedures performed, patient age, and complications. In the physician office or clinic setting, Medicare payment generally is based on a fee schedule, with payment rates set for each procedure performed and product used, although the schedule may in some instance bundle the product into the payment for the procedure. In some outpatient settings, such as in the case of the hospital outpatient clinic setting, Medicare payment rates generally are premised on classifications of services that have similar clinical characteristics and similar costs. To better track utilization, we filed an application with CMS for a unique HCPCS SkinTE Q code. We were successful and received Q code 4200, which was effective January 1, 2019.
 
Reimbursement policies depend in part on legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry and federal and state governments continue to propose and pass new healthcare legislation and government agencies revise or change their regulations and policies from time to time. We cannot predict whether or how such reform measures and policy changes would affect reimbursement rates and demand for our products.
 
Patient Privacy 
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Because our products use autologous tissue sources that are tracked and reapplied to the same individual patient from which the tissue was harvested, our business maintains substantial amounts of patient identifiable health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties. Since we do not submit claims electronically to payers, we do not believe we are a covered entity under HIPAA.

Transparency Laws 
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. We do not believe that we are a covered manufacturer under the Sunshine Act because our products are neither regulated as pharmaceuticals, biologics, nor medical devices by the FDA, and 361 HCT/P autologous tissue sources are not expressly addressed by this law.
USDA
 
The Company and its subsidiaries conduct preclinical research and development, which is regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) and must be performed in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, Animal Welfare Regulations, and Animal Care Policies. The Company and each of its subsidiaries that conduct preclinical research have in place Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees to oversee compliance with the animal care and use program and report accordingly to the USDA on an at least a semi-annual basis. All performance sites that maintain USDA-covered species are actively registered as USDA research facilities.
Employees
 
We had approximately 123 full-time employees as of October 31, 2018, all of whom are in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Corporate History
 
On December 1, 2016, Majesco Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Majesco Entertainment Company, a Delaware corporation (“Majesco DE”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with PolarityTE, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“PolarityTE NV”) and Dr. Denver Lough, the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of PolarityTE NV. The asset acquisition was subject to shareholder approval, which was received on March 10, 2017, and the transaction closed on April 7, 2017. In January 2017, Majesco DE changed its name to “PolarityTE, Inc.” (“PolarityTE”). Majesco Acquisition Corp. was then merged with PolarityTE NV, which remains a subsidiary of PolarityTE. Majesco Acquisition Corp. II, formed in November 2016 under Majesco Entertainment Company, changed its name to “PolarityTE MD, Inc.,” and remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of PolarityTE.
 
Prior to the acquisition of PolarityTE NV, Majesco DE developed and published a wide range of video games on digital networks through its Midnight City label. On May 2, 2017, Majesco Entertainment Company, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of PolarityTE (“Majesco NV Sub”), was formed, into which all the assets and liabilities of this gaming business were placed. On June 23, 2017, PolarityTE sold the Majesco NV Sub to Zift Interactive LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, pursuant to a purchase agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PolarityTE sold 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Majesco NV Sub to Zift, including all the right, title, and interest in and to Majesco NV Sub’s business of developing, publishing, and distributing video game products.
 
In May 2018 we acquired assets of a preclinical research and veterinary sciences business and related real estate, which we now operate through our subsidiary, Ibex Preclinical Research, Inc. The aggregate purchase price was $3.8 million, of which $2.3 million was paid at closing and the balance satisfied by a promissory note payable to the Seller with an initial fair value of $1.22 million and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of approximately $0.3 million. As a result, we have significant research facilities and a well-educated and skilled team of scientists and researchers that comprise the contract research segment of our business. These resources are highly beneficial to the work we are doing on our TE products and in RTD and ARC. We also offer research services to unrelated third parties on a contract basis, which we offer under the trademark POLARITYRD. Contract research services help us defray the costs of maintaining a first-rate research facility and allow us to meet companies pursuing new technologies that may be opportunities for collaborative or strategic relationships going forward.
