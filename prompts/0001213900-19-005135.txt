Corporate Strategy
 
Management’s corporate strategy is to continue to build and develop Inpixon as a technology company that provides turnkey solutions from the collection of data to delivering insights from that data to our customers with a focus on securing, digitizing and optimizing premises with IPA for businesses and governments. In connection with such strategy and in order to facilitate our long-term growth, we have acquired certain companies, technologies and intellectual property (“IP”) that complement such goals and will continue to consider completing additional strategic acquisitions as long as our financial condition permits. Currently, we are evaluating several complimentary technology companies that can add technology, differentiation, customers and/or revenue. We are primarily looking for accretive opportunities that have business value and operational synergies. We believe these complimentary technologies will allow us to provide a comprehensive Indoor Positioning Platform, or one-stop shop to our customers. For example, we are evaluating a few Mobile App/SDK platforms to help our customers with a code base to build or add locational context into their apps. We are also looking at various Wi-Fi-based positioning products to offer a no hardware solution at large locations leveraging existing access-point infrastructure. While these Wi-Fi solutions may not be as precise or comprehensive as our solution, we believe they can provide an entry-point solution that we can use to cross-sell our other product offerings. In addition, we are considering several Mapping interfaces that can provide a dynamic user-interface for outdoor and indoor positioning with layers for different users like consumers, marketing teams, IT, etc. We are also considering the possibility of adding GPS capabilities to our arsenal to enhance our Security Dome solution to areas beyond the indoors to include some outdoor areas as well. Allowing us to carry the blue dot seamlessly from the outside to the inside.
 
We believe that acquiring complementary products and/or IP will add value to the Company. Candidates with proven technologies that complement our overall strategy may come from anywhere in the world, so long as there are strategic and financial reasons to make the acquisition. If we make any acquisitions in the future, we expect that we may pay for such acquisitions using our equity securities, cash and debt financing in combinations appropriate for each acquisition.

 IPA Product Enhancements
 
Inpixon is a company in the information and technology industry and therefore keeping up with the technological advancements within the industry are critical to our long-term success and growth. As a result, our senior management must continuously work to ensure that they remain informed and prepared to quickly adapt and leverage new technologies within our product and service offering as such technologies become available. In connection with that goal, our product roadmap development plans include the use of blockchain technology to maintain and propagate device reputation, enforcing security policies and attaining compliance, artificial intelligence for amassing anonymous device information, integrating video image analytics for additional attributes, ultra-wideband technology for asset tracking and a voice-assisted analytics interface.
Blockchain Technology for Device Reputation
 
Our IPA platform locates, monitors and analyzes the path of all cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices, regardless of make, manufacturer or device type, allowing not just the ability to identify and prevent unwanted mobile devices, but also the ability to track and analyze device traffic within an indoor location. The addition of “device reputation” to our IPA platform has been an important component of our anticipated product enhancements. “Device reputation” refers to information regarding the particular history of a device, such as when a device enters a certain location, where within that location the device has travelled, the types of activities for which the device was previously used, including, but not limited to, whether the device is linked to prior fraudulent activities, and information concerning accounts that the device might be linked to.
 
We intend to use “blockchain technology” in order to propagate device reputation profiles. “Blockchain technology” refers to a type of decentralized “distributed ledger” or database that can be used to securely record, store, share and synchronize data or information across multiple networks in various locations. The lack of a centralized location to store information concerning a single device reputation profile results in a more secure repository for data and makes hacking or accessing that information for fraudulent purposes extremely difficult. Accessing and falsifying or otherwise using information that is stored across a network of multiple servers in different locations for fraudulent purposes would require breaching not just one server but the majority of the servers on which the information is stored making it significantly more difficult, if not impossible, to breach, thus creating a higher level of security. We intend to leverage open source blockchain technology available to us without cost, by re-engineering such technology from a transaction-based schema to a behavior-based schema in order to create a private proprietary code-base specifically for use within our IPA platform, to serve as a repository of “device reputation” collected in connection with our IPA platform’s analytics capabilities. The collected data regarding device behavior will be secured through conventional methods of encrypted storage allowing for tamper proof audit trails with respect to device activity and behavior. While we may decide to hire 1-3 additional employees during 2018 with greater expertise with blockchain technology, the addition of these employees is not critical to our business plans insofar as the intent is to use open source technology and consult with third parties and/or provide training for its employees on an as needed basis. We have an initial development of this technology within our IPA platform, but have not yet incorporated such technology into our platform. We believe we can quickly incorporate this technology upon request by our customers.

Artificial Intelligence
 
        In 2019, we intend to expand our use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to anonymously capture device identity, build a repository of device profiles and fingerprints, and offer intelligent solutions, which will continue to be refined over time, for enterprise security and marketing customers. Following this enhancement, Inpixon’s IPA AI engine will be able to assist in providing predictive, more accurate, bidirectional information to secure the indoors. Inpixon’s IPA AI engine will interface with disparate customer site data sources and the platform’s locationing data. The AI engine will apply heuristic analytical algorithms to data that is accumulated over time, identifying new patterns in device and customer behavior, and deliver this information to customers and users via IPA and/or an application program interface (API) in real time. For the security domain, IPA’s AI analytics will be able to identify device behavior patterns on networks that are associated with existing blacklisted devices, analyze device behavior and, after pattern matching, predictively alert users to a potentially risky device and quarantine eminent threats.  Inpixon uses proto- AI techniques at almost all major layers of its technology stack including identifying devices anonymously. The IPA AI engine will start identifying patterns of MAC Address changes based on incremental changes in the metadata of incoming device probe packets and device velocity patterns to de-randomize MAC addresses, which will enable it to accurately predict device counts and identify devices whose MAC addresses are constantly changing.  By applying the same technology to the retail and marketing dimension, IPA’s AI engine will give managers the ability to accurately predict and quantify variance in crowd movement patterns, footfalls, and revenue for store relocations and marketing campaigns, providing Inpixon customers with the opportunity to monetize this intelligence in correlation with big data like dwell time, weather patterns, and demographics. We intend to continue to add AI and machine learning enhancements to our platform as we expand our customer base and add new big data partners to our ecosystem.
 Voice-Assisted Analytics Interface
 
 We also intend to use enterprise voice-user interface (VUI) technology to support our network of retail and marketing customers in making better decisions with deeper intelligence. The VUI technology in our IPA platform will perform as a digital assistant for marketers, allowing them to make quick, hands-free decisions based on vetted, predictive information provided with simple voice/speech commands while also providing a complete audit trail. While the use of platforms such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have made VUIs modern household names, Inpixon’s IPA VUI is uniquely built for the enterprise marketing space digital assistant with no monitor, no keyboard, no mouse and only an audio input/output device that functions just like a search engine, listening for keywords. While the technology itself is not revolutionary, it will modernize meetings and brainstorm sessions by speeding up intelligence gathering, with nearly instantaneous access to company information and big data, it will be able to predict outcomes based on past information, and make suggestions to keep business moving efficiently and effectively. At the same time, Inpixon’s IPA VUI will maintain a written log of all queries, seamlessly reporting all statistics back to meeting attendees through an automated email. 
  IPA Pod
 
The Inpixon IPA Pod is a new addition to the Inpixon line of Radio Frequency sensors. The IPA Pod lowers the entry-level barriers to radio detection based Indoor Positioning for our clients for Visitor Analytics in retail by delivering Wi-Fi and/or BT/BLE only based device locationing and tracking capabilities. The IPA Pod is a relatively inexpensive first step for most retail customers, which delivers a significant amount of value at a fraction of the cost when compared to the full IPA Sensor and other competitive solutions. It is designed to be a plug-and-play device that forms a self-calibrating array of IPA Pods that calibrates itself periodically to deal with ever changing RF environments and continuously deliver high positional accuracy. It is designed to plug into existing electrical outlets and/or be deployed using Power-over-Ethernet drops and can backhaul data over wire or wirelessly. The IPA Pod can be deployed in various densities in a given 3D space to match a wide array of customer use cases needing various levels of positional accuracy from the zone-level to room-level to aisle-level.

Asset Tracking
 
In 2019, we will continue to build the Inpixon IPA suite of solutions and enhance our existing tag tracking solutions. Using combinations of RFID, Dash7 and UWB frequencies we will leverage our hardware sensors as listeners for tracking assets including employees, visitors and physical assets. With capability for accuracy less than 0.5 meters, this solution continues to drive our capabilities in precise indoor location. Advancements in battery technology and wearables allow us to integrate and/or design new tag solutions for high value assets.
Research and Development Expenses
 
Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Our management believes that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain a competitive position. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled approximately $2.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
 
We utilize direct sales and marketing through approximately 5 sales representatives, who are compensated with a base salary and, in certain instances, may participate in incentive plans such as commissions or bonuses. We utilize webinars, conferences, tradeshows and other direct and indirect marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. We also have relationships with channel partners to directly engage with customers and to perform the installation services. We train our partners and we have our own channel/partner managers to support and augment partners as needed. We are in the process of expanding our channel partners in both security and intelligence markets.
 
Our Inpixon products are primarily sold on a license (up-front one-time fee) or software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. In our licensing model, we also typically charge an annual maintenance fee. The SaaS model is typically for a 2-3 year contract and includes maintenance upgrades. The SaaS model generates a recurring revenue stream. Our Shoom product is on a monthly subscription model based on 2-3 year contracts.
 
Customers
 
The Company’s customers include shopping malls, airports, government agencies, local publications, among others. Our top three customers accounted for approximately 49% and 26% of our gross revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. One customer accounted for 33% of our gross revenue in 2018. From time to time one or two customers can represent a significant portion of our revenue as a result of one-time projects.
Competition
 
Our products compete with Wi-Fi based detection companies such as Aruba, Cisco, Euclid Analytics, Mist Networks, Aislelabs and other smaller companies. However, these companies primarily offer only Wi-Fi and/or Blue-tooth detection and therefore we believe they cannot achieve the accuracy and comprehensive detection that Inpixon can achieve. Inpixon has partnered with or replaced some of these companies because it offers Wi-Fi, cellular, RFID and Bluetooth and has a location accuracy of approximately 10-feet. Mobile device management companies like AirWatch, Mobile Iron and Good Technology have also integrated with Inpixon instead of developing competing products. MerlinOne and PressTeligence compete with the functionality of our Shoom products, but typically provide information only for the specific customer and not for the customer’s competitors or for the industry.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns U.S. trademark registrations for the following six marks: Inpixon, IPA, Indoor Positioning Analytics, Security Dome, Shoom, and ZoneDefense. Each of these registrations is in the first 10-year registration term and the Company intends to renew each registration for additional 10-year renewal terms, as available. The Company also has pending applications for the following three additional marks:  Inpixon and ZoneDefense, both of which cover goods that are different from the goods and services covered in the Company’s issued trademark registrations for the same marks, and ZoneAware. The Company has seven pending applications and eight registered patents in various countries and regions, including the United States, Mexico, Australia, and the European Patent Organization region, relating to Inpixon products. The awarded patents were issued in 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019 and will expire in the years 2028, 2031, 2032, and 2033.

Government Regulation
 
In general, we are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anticorruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition.
 
Violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations. To date, compliance with these regulations has not been financially burdensome.
 
Employees
 
As of March 20, 2019, we have 69 employees including 1 part-time employee. This includes 4 officers, 8 sales personnel, 2 marketing personnel, 49 technical/engineering personnel and 6 finance and administration personnel.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 
● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 

 
Reduced disclosure of financial information in this report, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information.
 
As a smaller reporting company, each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We will cease to be an emerging growth company on December 31, 2019, or, immediately, if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year-period.
 
The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have chosen to “opt out” of this provision. Therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
