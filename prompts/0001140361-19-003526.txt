ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of premium replacement parts for the engine management and temperature control systems of motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry with a complementary focus on heavy duty, industrial equipment and the original equipment market.
 
We are organized into two operating segments.  Each segment focuses on providing our customers with full-line coverage of premium engine management or temperature control products, and a full suite of complimentary services that are tailored to our customers’ business needs and driving end-user demand for our products.  We sell our products primarily to automotive aftermarket retailers, program distribution groups, warehouse distributors, original equipment manufacturers and original equipment service part operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia and other Latin American countries.
 
  Our Culture
 
Our Company was founded on the values of ethics, integrity, common decency and respect for others.  These values are embodied in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company to serve as a statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business.  We believe that our commitment to our Company, our employees and the communities within which we operate has led to high employee satisfaction and low employee turnover, and our commitment to our customers, suppliers and business parties has resulted in high customer satisfaction, as evidenced by the customer awards that we routinely win, and decades-long customer relationships.  We also seek ways to positively contribute to our local communities by operating our facilities with conservation in mind, holding charitable drives, and being a good neighbor.
The Automotive Aftermarket
 
The automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size.  In addition to manufacturing, aftermarket companies must allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend.  Aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes, and must distribute, with rapid turnaround times, products for nearly all domestic and import vehicles on the road today.
 
The automotive aftermarket replacement parts business differs substantially from the OEM parts business.  Unlike the OEM parts business that primarily follows trends in new car production, the automotive aftermarket replacement parts business primarily tends to follow different trends, such as:
 
  
· | the number of vehicles on the road;

Our Products & Services
 
Engine Management Segment
 
Our Engine Management Segment manufactures and distributes a full line of critical components for the ignition, electrical, emissions, fuel and safety-related systems of motor vehicles.  Key product categories within our engine management portfolio include: electronic ignition control modules, fuel injectors, including diesel injectors and pumps (new and remanufactured), ignition wires, coils, switches, relays, EGR valves, distributor caps and rotors, various sensors primarily measuring temperature, pressure and position in numerous vehicle systems (such as camshaft and crankshaft position, fuel pressure, vehicle speed and mass airflow sensors), electronic throttle bodies, keyless entry transmitters, safety-related components, such as anti-lock brake (ABS) sensors, tire pressure monitoring (TPMS) sensors and park assist sensors, in addition to many other engine management components.
 
We continuously look to expand our product offering to provide our customers with full-line coverage.  We have more recently expanded our offering by adding late-model coverage for existing product categories, and new product categories in response to new and evolving vehicle technologies, including VVT solenoids and sprockets, diesel injectors, pumps and components, turbochargers, evaporation emission control system components, exhaust gas temperature sensors, active grill shutters, battery current sensors, third brake lights, and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) components, including blind spot detection sensors, cruise control distance sensors, lane departure sensor cameras and park assist backup cameras.
 
Ignition, Emission Control, Fuel & Safety Related System Products.  Replacement parts for ignition, emission, fuel and safety related systems accounted for approximately $648.3 million, or 59%, of our consolidated net sales in 2018, approximately $657.3 million, or 59%, of our consolidated net sales in 2017, and approximately $616.5 million, or 58%, of our consolidated net sales in 2016.

Wire & Cable Products.  Wire and cable parts accounted for approximately $155.2 million, or 14%, of our consolidated net sales in 2018, approximately $172.1 million, or 15%, of our consolidated net sales in 2017, and approximately $149 million, or 14%, of our consolidated net sales in 2016.  These products include ignition (spark plug) wire sets, battery cables, pigtails, sockets and a wide range of electrical wire, terminals, connectors and tools for servicing an automobile’s electrical system.
 
In May 2016, we acquired the North American automotive ignition wire business of General Cable Corporation (“General Cable”).  The acquisition included General Cable’s automotive ignition wire business in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  For additional information regarding our integration efforts related to the acquisition, refer to the information set forth under the caption “Integration Costs” appearing in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
 
Computer-Controlled Technology.  Nearly all new vehicles are factory‑equipped with computer‑controlled engine management systems that monitor and control ignition, emissions, fuel economy, transmission and many other automotive systems.  The on‑board computers monitor inputs from many types of sensors located throughout the vehicle, and control a myriad of valves, solenoids, coils, switches and motors to manage engine and vehicle performance.  Computer-controlled engine management systems enable the engine to operate with improved fuel efficiency and reduced levels of emissions.  Our sales of sensors, valves, solenoids and related parts have increased as automobile manufacturers equip their cars with more complex engine management systems.
 
Government mandated emissions and fuel economy regulations have been implemented throughout the United States.  The Clean Air Act imposes strict emissions control test standards on existing and new vehicles, and remains the preeminent legislation in the area of vehicle emissions.  As many states have implemented required inspection/maintenance tests, the Environmental Protection Agency, through its rulemaking ability, has also encouraged both manufacturers and drivers to reduce vehicle emissions.  Automobiles must now comply with emissions standards from the time they were manufactured and, in most states, until the last day they are in use.  This law and other government emissions laws and fuel economy regulations have had a positive impact on sales of our ignition, emissions control and fuel delivery parts since vehicles failing these laws may require repairs utilizing parts sold by us.
 
Safety, Driver Assistance and Collision Avoidance Systems. An increasing number of new vehicles are factory-equipped with government-mandated safety devices, such as anti-lock braking systems and air bags. As these systems mature, requiring servicing and repair, we anticipate increased sales opportunities for many of our products such as ABS sensors, TPMS sensors and traction control products.  Newer automotive systems include Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Collision Avoidance Systems to alert the driver to potential problems, or to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards.  Many of these systems use on-board computers to monitor inputs from sensing devices located throughout the vehicle.  As the use and complexity of these systems continue to develop and proliferate, we expect to identify and benefit from new sales opportunities within this category.
 
Temperature Control Segment
 
Our Temperature Control Segment manufactures and distributes a full line of critical components for the temperature control (air conditioning and heating) systems, engine cooling systems, power window accessories and windshield washer systems of motor vehicles.  Key product categories within our temperature control portfolio include: air conditioning compressors (new and remanufactured), air conditioning compressor repair kits, clutch assemblies, blower and radiator fan motors, filter dryers, evaporators, accumulators, hose assemblies, thermal expansion devices, heater valves, heater cores, A/C service tools and chemicals, fan assemblies, fan clutches, oil coolers, window lift motors, window regulators and assemblies, and windshield washer pumps.
 
We continuously look to improve our cost position through strategic transactions with manufacturers in low cost regions.  In November 2017, we formed another joint venture with Foshan Guangdong Automotive Air Conditioning Co., Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of air conditioning compressors for the automotive aftermarket and the Chinese OE market.  In April 2014, we formed a joint venture with Gwo Yng Enterprise Co., Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of air conditioning accumulators, filter driers, hose assemblies, and switches.  We believe that these transactions will enhance our position as a basic low-cost manufacturer and a leading supplier of temperature control parts to the aftermarket, as well as provide us with an opportunity for growth in the China market.

The automotive aftermarket is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all markets that we serve.  Our success in the marketplace depends on our ability execute the key elements of our business strategy discussed above.  Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.  In addition, we face competition from automobile manufacturers who supply many of the replacement parts sold by us, although these manufacturers generally supply parts only for cars they produce through OE dealerships. 
Sales and Distribution
 
In the aftermarket channel, we sell our products to warehouse distributors and retailers.  Our customers buy directly from us and sell directly to jobber stores, professional technicians and to “do-it-yourselfers” who perform automotive repairs on their personal vehicles.  In recent years, warehouse distributors have consolidated with other distributors, and an increasing number of distributors own their jobber stores or sell down channel to professional technicians.  Retailers are also consolidating with other retailers and have begun to increase their efforts to sell to professional technicians adding additional competition in the “do-it-for-me,” or the professional technician segment of our industry.  As automotive parts and systems become more complex, “do-it-yourselfers” are less likely to service their own vehicles and may become more reliant on professional technicians.
 
In the original equipment and original equipment service channel, we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) for use in the production of vehicles or for distribution within their distribution network to independent dealerships and service dealer technicians.  In addition to new car sales, automotive dealerships sell parts and service vehicles.  We also sell our products to Tier 1 suppliers of OEMs.
 
We sell our products primarily in the United States, with additional sales in Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia and other Latin American countries.  Our sales are substantially denominated in U.S. dollars.  For information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 22 “Industry Segment and Geographic Data” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
 
Our sales force is structured to meet the needs of our customers across the distribution channel, allowing us to provide value-added services that we believe are unmatched by our competitors.  We also believe that our sales force is the premier direct sales force for our product lines due to our concentration of highly‑qualified, well‑trained sales personnel.  We focus our recruitment efforts on candidates who have technical backgrounds as well as strong sales experience, and we provide our sales personnel extensive instruction and continuing education at our training facility in Irving, Texas, which allows our sales force to stay current on troubleshooting and repair techniques.  The continuing education courses along with monthly supplemental web-based training are an integral part of our sales force development strategy.
 
Our customers have come to depend on our sales personnel as a reliable source for technical information and to assist with sales to their customers (e.g., jobber stores and professional technicians).  In this manner, we direct a significant portion of our sales efforts to our customers’ customers to generate demand for our products, and we believe that the structure of our sales force facilitates these efforts by enabling us to implement our sales and marketing programs uniformly throughout the distribution channel.  One of the ways we generate this demand is by offering in-person training seminars on 30 different topics, which teach approximately 60,000 technicians annually how to diagnose and repair vehicles equipped with complex systems related to our products.  We also offer on-demand training webinars online on 144 different topics.  Approximately 14,000 technicians were registered to participate in such sessions in 2018.
 
We offer a variety of strategic customer discounts, allowances and incentives to increase customer purchases of our products.  For example, we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice.  We also offer rebates and discounts to customers as advertising and sales force allowances, and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided.  We believe these discounts, allowances and incentives are a common practice throughout the automotive aftermarket industry, and we intend to continue to offer them in response to competitive pressures and to strategically support the growth of all our products.

Seasonality
 
Historically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment.  It is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business.  In addition to this seasonality, the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories.  For example, a warm summer, as we experienced in 2018, may increase the demand for our temperature control products, while a mild summer, as we experienced in 2017, may lessen such demand.  As a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products, our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received.  During this period, our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility.
Working Capital and Inventory Management
 
Automotive aftermarket companies have been under increasing pressure to provide broad SKU (stock keeping unit) coverage due to parts and brand proliferation.  In response to this, we have made, and continue to make, changes to our inventory management system designed to reduce inventory requirements.  We have a pack‑to‑order distribution system, which permits us to retain slow moving items in a bulk storage state until an order for a specific branded part is received.  This system reduces the volume of a given part in inventory.  We also expanded our inventory management system to improve inventory deployment, enhance our collaboration with customers on forecasts and inventory assortments, and further integrate our supply chain both to customers and suppliers.
 
We face inventory management issues as a result of overstock returns.  We permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits (which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us) in the event that they have overstocked their inventories.  In addition, the seasonality of our Temperature Control Segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns.
 
Our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to our sales mix of temperature control products.  Our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received.  These increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
 
Production and Engineering
 
We engineer, tool and manufacture many of the components used in the assembly of our products.  We also perform our own plastic molding operations, stamping and machining operations, wire extrusion, automated electronics assembly and a wide variety of other processes.  In the case of remanufactured components, we conduct our own teardown, diagnostics and rebuilding for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps.  We have found this level of vertical integration provides advantages in terms of cost, quality and availability.  We intend to continue selective efforts toward further vertical integration to ensure a consistent quality and supply of low cost components.  In addition, our strategy includes sourcing an increasing number of finished goods and component parts from low cost regions such as those in Asia.

Index

Suppliers
 
We source materials through a global network of suppliers to ensure a consistent, high quality and low cost supply of materials and key components for our product lines.  We are not dependent on any single commodity.
 
The principal raw materials purchased by us consist of brass, electronic components, fabricated copper (primarily in the form of magnet and insulated cable), steel magnets, laminations, tubes and shafts, stamped steel parts, copper wire, stainless steel coils and rods, aluminum coils, fittings, rods, cast aluminum parts, lead, steel roller bearings, rubber molding compound, thermo‑set and thermo plastic molding powders, and chemicals.  Additionally, we use components and cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, diesel pumps, and turbo chargers.
 
In the case of cores for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, diesel pumps, and turbo chargers, we obtain them either from exchanges with customers who return cores subsequent to purchasing remanufactured parts or through direct purchases from a network of core brokers.  In addition, we acquire certain materials by purchasing products that are resold into the market, particularly by OEM sources and other domestic and foreign suppliers.
 
We believe there is an adequate supply of primary raw materials and cores; however, there can be no assurance over the long term that the availability of materials and components or increases in commodity prices will not materially affect our business or results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,400 people, with 1,800 people in the United States and 2,600 people in Mexico, Canada, Poland, the U.K., Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Of the 4,400 people employed, approximately 2,600 people are production employees.  We operate primarily in non‑union facilities and have binding labor agreements with employees at other unionized facilities.  We have approximately 77 production employees in Edwardsville, Kansas who are covered by a contract with The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) that expires in April 2019.  We expect to renew this agreement with the UAW upon mutually agreeable terms.  We also have approximately 1,500 employees in Mexico who are covered under union agreements negotiated at various intervals.
 
We believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our union and non‑union employees are good.  Our employees share our corporate values of ethics, integrity, common decency and respect of others, values which have been established since our company was founded in 1919.
