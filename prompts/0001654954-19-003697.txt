ITEM 1. BUSINESS
   
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology products based off our proprietary Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE), Tetra-specific Killer Engager (TetraKE) and bi-specific Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) technology platforms. Our TriKE and TetraKE platforms generate proprietary moieties designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient’s own natural killer, or NK, cells. Once bound to an NK cell, our moieties are designed to enhance the NK cell and precisely direct it to one or more specifically-targeted proteins (tumor antigens) expressed on a specific type of cancer, ultimately resulting in the cancer cell’s death. TriKEs and TetraKEs are made up of recombinant fusion proteins, can be designed to target any number of tumor antigens on hematologic malignancies, sarcomas or solid tumors and do not require patient-specific customization. They are designed to be dosed in a common outpatient setting similar to modern antibody therapeutics and are expected to have reasonably low cost of goods. Our ADC platform generates product candidates that are bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion proteins that, we believe, represent the next generation of ADCs.
  
 We are using our TriKE and TetraKE platforms with the intent to bring to market immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcoma and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable, and we are putting processes in place to be able to produce IND-ready moieties in a timely manner after a specific TriKE or TetraKE conceptual design. After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies. We are also evaluating, in conjunction with our Scientific Advisory Board, additional moieties designed to target different tumor antigens. We believe our TriKEs and TetraKEs may have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
  
 We also believe our bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion proteins are examples of the next generation of ADCs. We believe GTB-1550 has certain properties that could result in competitive advantages over recently approved ADC products targeting leukemias and lymphomas and/or have utility in other niche populations. In a Phase 1 trial, of nine patients that achieved adequate blood levels, in two heavily pretreated patients a continuous partial remission (PR) and complete remission (CR) were observed. One of these patients, who had failed multiple previous treatment regimens, has been in remission since early 2015.
  
 Our initial work has been conducted in collaboration with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota under a program led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller, the Deputy Director. Dr. Miller is a recognized leader in the field of NK cell and IL-15 biology and their therapeutic potential. We have exclusive rights to the TriKE and TetraKE platforms and are generating additional intellectual property around specific moieties.

 Also, in connection with the acquisition of Georgetown Translational Pharmaceuticals on September 1, 2017, we acquired a portfolio of in-process research and development central nervous system (“CNS”) assets consisting of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies. These CNS assets address disease states such as chronic neuropathic pain, myasthenia gravis and motion sickness. We are currently pursuing out-licensing opportunities related to these assets.
 
  Immuno-Oncology Platform
 
  Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKEs) and Tetra-specific Killer Engagers (TetraKEs)
 
 The generation of chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, expressing T cells from monoclonal antibodies has represented an important step forward in cancer therapy. These therapies involve the genetic engineering of T cells to express either CARs, or T cell receptors, or TCRs, and are designed such that the modified T cells can recognize and destroy cancer cells. While a great deal of interest has recently been placed upon chimeric antigen receptor T, or CAR-T, therapy, it has certain limitations for broad potential applicability because it can require an individual approach that is expensive and time consuming, and may be difficult to apply on a large scale. We believe there is an unmet need for targeted immuno-oncology therapies that have the potential to be dosed in a patient-friendly outpatient setting, can be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics and/or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy. We believe our TriKE and TetraKE constructs have this potential and therefore we have generated, and intend to continue to generate, a pipeline of product candidates to be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies.
 
 NK cells represent an important immunotherapeutic target as they are involved in tumor immune-surveillance, can mediate antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), contain pre-made granules with perforin and granzyme B and can quickly secrete inflammatory cytokines, and unlike T cells they do not require antigen priming and can kill cells in the absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation.
  
 Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKEs and TetraKEs are small single-chain fusion proteins that bind the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potent and lasting response, as demonstrated by preclinical studies. An additional benefit they may have is attractive biodistribution, as a consequence of their smaller size, which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these advantages, TriKEs and TetraKEs are designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens.
 
  Background and Select Non-Clinical Data
 
 In conjunction with our research agreement with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, the exploration of targeting NK cells to a variety of tumors initially focused on novel bi-specific killer engagers, or BiKEs, composed of the variable portions of antibodies targeting the CD16 activating receptor on NK cells and CD33 (AML and MDS; see figure below), CD19/CD22 (B cell lymphomas), or EpCAM (epithelial tumors (breast, colon, and lung)) on the tumor cells.

 Subsequently, a tri-specific (TriKE) construct that replaced the linker molecule between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv with a modified IL-15 molecule, containing flanking sequences, was generated and tested. Data indicate that the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 and CD16 x IL-15 x EpCAM TriKEs potently induce proliferation of healthy donor NK cells, possibly greater than that induced by exogenous IL-15, which is absent in the BiKE platform. Targeted delivery of the IL-15 through the TriKE also resulted in specific expansion of the NK cells without inducing T cell expansion on post-transplant patient samples.
 
 When compared to the CD16 x CD33 BiKE, the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 TriKE is also capable of potently restoring killing capacity of post- transplant NK cells against CD33-expressing HL-60 Targets and primary AML blasts. These results demonstrated the ability to functionally incorporate an IL-5 cytokine into the BiKE platform and also demonstrated the possibility of targeting a variety of cytokines directly to NK cells while reducing off-target effects and the amount of cytokines needed to obtain biologically relevant function.
 
 The figure below is a schematic of a BiKE construct (top) and a TriKE construct (bottom), which has the modified IL-15 linker between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv components.
  


 The TriKE constructs were also tested against three separate human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocitic leukemia), Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), in addition to a model for ovarian cancer. All cell lines contained the Luc reporter to allow for in vivo imaging of the tumors. These systems were used to show in vivo efficacy of BiKEs (1633) and TriKEs (GTB-3550) against relevant human tumor targets (HL-60-luc) over an extended period of time. The system consisted of initial conditioning of mice using radiation (250-275 cGy), followed by injection of the tumor cells (I.V. for HL-60-luc and Raji-luc, intra-splenic for HT29-luc and IP for ovarian for MA-148-luc), a three-day growth phase, injection of human NK cells, and repeated injection of the drugs of interest, BiKE and TriKE (three to five times a week). Imaging was carried out at day 7, 14, and 21, and extended as needed.
 
 Figure A below shows the results (tumor burden and mortality) when dosing NK cells alone (top panel), the BiKE version (lacking IL-15) of GTB-3550 (middle panel; called 1633), and the TriKE, GTB-3550 (bottom panel; then called 161533) in the above described human tumor model, HL-60-luc. In the NK-cell-only arm, two out of the five mice were dead by day 21 with two of the surviving mice having extensive tumor burden as depicted by the colored images. In contrast, all five mice in each of the BiKE and TriKE arms survived. In addition, the tumor burden in the TriKE-treated mice was significantly less than in the BiKE-treated mice, demonstrating the improved efficacy from NK cells in the TriKE-treated mice.

 Based on these results, and others, the IND for GTB-3550 was filed in June 2017 by the University of Minnesota. FDA requested that additional preclinical toxicology be conducted prior to initiating clinical trials. The FDA also requested some additional information and clarifications on the manufacturing (CMC) and clinical packages. The requested additional information and clarifications were completed and incorporated by us into the IND in eCTD format. We filed the IND amendment in June 2018 and announced on November 1, 2018 that we had received notification from the FDA that the IND was open and the Company was authorized to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study with GTB-3550 in AML, MDS and severe mastocytosis. We expect to be in a position to begin the Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2019.
 
  Generation of humanized single-domain antibody targeting CD16 for incorporation into the TriKE platform
 
 To develop second generation TriKEs, we designed a new humanized CD16 engager derived from a single-domain antibody. While scFvs consist of a heavy and a light variable chain joined by a linker, single-domain antibodies consist of a single variable heavy chain capable of engaging without the need of a light chain counterpart (see figure below).

 These single-domain antibodies are thought to have certain attractive features for antibody engineering, including physical stability, ability to bind deep grooves, and increased production yields, amongst others. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated increased activity (NK Cell Degranulation) and functionality (NC Cell Cytokine Production) of the single-domain CD16 TriKE (GTB-C3550) compared to the original TriKE (GTB-3550) (see figure below). These data were presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology Conference.

  Targeting Solid Tumors and Other Potentially Attractive Characteristics
 
 Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKEs and TetraKEs are small single-chain fusion proteins that bind the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potentially more potent and lasting response as demonstrated by preclinical studies. An additional benefit that they may have is an attractive biodistribution, because of their smaller size, which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these potential advantages, TriKEs and TetraKEs are designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens. We believe these attributes make them an ideal pharmaceutical platform for potentiated NK cell-based immunotherapies and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of CAR-T therapy and other antibody therapies.
 
 Examples of our earlier stage solid tumor targeting product candidates are focused on EpCAM, Her2, Mesothelin (mesothelioma and lung adenocarcinoma), and CD133 alone and in combination. We believe certain of these constructs have the potential to target prostate, breast, colon, ovarian, liver, and head and neck cancers. Depending on the availability of drug supply, we hope to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2020.
 
  Efficient Advancement of Potential Future Product Candidates --Production and Scale Up
 
 We are using our TriKE and TetraKE platforms with the intent to bring to market multiple immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable and we are currently working with several third parties investigating the optimal expression system of the TriKEs and TetraKE constructs which we expect to be part of a process in which we are able to produce IND-ready moieties in approximately 90-120 days after the construct conceptual design.
 
 After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be rapidly advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies. We are currently evaluating over a dozen moieties and intend to announce additional clinical product candidates in the second half of 2019.
 
 We believe our TriKEs and TetraKEs will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
 
  Bi-specific Antibody-Drug Conjugates Program
 
 Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of potent biopharmaceutical drugs designed as a targeted therapy for the treatment of cancer. ADCs combine the antitumor potency of highly cytotoxic small-molecule drugs with the high selectivity, pharmacokinetic profile of mAbs. These attributes allow sensitive discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue. We believe our bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion protein represents an example of the next generation of ADCs.
 
 We are currently utilizing a single chain bispecific recombinant fusion protein consisting of an anti-CD22 sFv, an anti-CD19 sFv, and DT390 (the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin). It is a cytotoxic molecule produced by recombinant DNA techniques composed of a fusion gene consisting of sequences for DT390 and also sequences encoding two separate and distinct sFvs, one recognizing CD22 and one recognizing CD19. The anti-CD22 sFv comes from the monoclonal antibody RFB4 and this sFv is currently in clinical trials involving another anti-CD22 immunotoxin called BL22. The anti-CD19 sFv is from the monoclonal antibody HD37 that has previously been used clinically. Published preclinical studies have shown that the presence of both sFvs on the same single chain molecule results in a bispecific fusion toxin that has superior activity and anti-cancer effects compared to the monospecific fusion toxins. Between the VL and VH regions of the sFvs, we have introduced aggregation reducing sequences (ARL) which has produced a product which has demonstrated better activity against scid mouse systemic models of B cell malignancy. The action of DT2219 occurs as a result of binding to the CD22 and/or CD19 receptors, subsequent internalization, and enzymatic inhibition of protein synthesis leading to cell death.
 
 We believe that our single-chain bi-specific recombinant fusion proteins utilizing novel linkers and innovative warheads represent an important advance over currently marketed ADCs. Utilizing our bi-specific ADC platform we have the ability to generate novel ADCs with unique targets, linkers and warheads. This platform provides us with the ability to rapidly construct novel ADCs with the potential to treat a wide range of cancers, including hematologic and solid tumors.
 
  Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
  Our most advanced bi-specific ADC, GTB-1550, which targets CD19+ and/or CD22+ hematological malignancies, is in the Phase 2 component of a Phase 1/2 Non-Hodgins Lymphoma (NHL)/Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) trial which is an open-label, investigator-led study. We are initially targeting certain hematologic malignancies as we believe our product candidates may have certain advantages over existing and other in-development products.

 Our TriKE product candidates, GTB-3550 and GTB-C3550, are single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion proteins composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains (or heavy chain only) of anti-CD16 antibodies, wild-type or a modified form of IL-15 and the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody designed to precisely target a specific tumor antigen. We utilize the NK stimulating cytokine human IL-15 as a crosslinker between the two scFvs which is designed to provide a self-sustaining signal leading to the proliferation and activation of NK cells thus enhancing their ability to kill cancer cells mediated by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
  
 Our TetraKE product candidates are single-chain fusion proteins composed of human single-domain anti-CD16 antibody, wild-type IL-15 and the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of two antibodies that are designed to target two specific tumor antigens expressed on specific types of cancer cells. An example of a TetraKE product candidate is GTB-1615 which is designed to target EpCAM and CD133 positive solid tumors. EpCAM is found on many solid tumor cells of epithelial origin and CD133 is a marker for cancer stem cells. GTB-1615 is designed to enable a patient’s NK cells to kill not only the heterogeneous population of cancer cells found in many solid tumors but also kill the cancer stem cells that can be responsible for recurrences.
 
  GTB-1550
  GTB-1550 is a bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin (DT390) as its cytotoxic drug payload. CD19 is a membrane glycoprotein present on the surface of all stages of B-lymphocyte development and is also expressed on most B-cell mature lymphoma cells and leukemia cells. CD22 is a glycoprotein expressed on B-lineage lymphoid precursors, including precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and often is co-expressed with CD19 on mature B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma.
  
 GTB-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors. When GTB-1550 binds to cancer cells, the cancer cells internalize GTB-1550, and are killed due to the action of drug’s cytotoxic diphtheria toxin payload. GTB-1550 has completed a Phase 1 human clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia.
 
 The initial Phase 1 study enrolled 25 patients with mature or precursor B-cell lymphoid malignancies expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors. All 25 patients received at least a single course of therapy. The treatment at the higher doses produced objective tumor responses with one patient in continuous partial remission and the second in complete remission. A Phase 1/2 trial of GTB-1550 in 18 patients was recently completed in patients with ALL/NHL. The FDA-approved clinical trial was conducted at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center. The data is currently being analyzed. We expect to submit data from this Phase 1/2 study for presentation/publication.
 
  GTB-3550
 
 GTB-3550 is our first TriKE product candidate. It is a single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion protein conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. We intend to study this anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, and other hematopoietic malignancies. CD33 is primarily a myeloid differentiation antigen with endocytic properties broadly expressed on AML blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells. CD33 or Siglec-3 (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3, SIGLEC3, SIGLEC3, gp67, p67) is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage. It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. The anti-CD33 antibody fragment that will be used for these studies was derived from the M195 humanized anti-CD33 scFV and has been used in multiple human clinical studies. It has been exploited as target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. We believe the recent approval of the antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab validates this targeted approach.
 
 The GTB-3550 IND will focus on AML, the most common form of adult leukemia with 21,000 new cases expected in 2018 alone (American Cancer Society). These patients typically receive frontline therapy, usually chemotherapy, including cytarabine and an anthracycline, a therapy that has not changed in over 40 years. About half will have relapses and require alternative therapies. In addition, MDS incidence rates have dramatically increased in the population of the United States from 3.3 per 100,000 individuals from 2001-2004 to 70 per 100,000 annually, MDS is especially prevalent in elderly patients that have a median age of 76 years at diagnosis. The survival of patients with MDS is poor due to decreased eligibility, as a result of advanced age, for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo- HSCT), the only curative MDS treatment (Cogle CR. Incidence and Burden of the Myelodysplastic Syndromes. Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2015; 10(3):272-281). We believe GTB-3550 could serve as a relatively safe, cost-effective, and easy-to-use therapy for resistant/relapsing AML and could also be combined with chemotherapy as frontline therapy thus targeting the larger market.
 
 The IND for GTB-3550 was filed in June 2017 by the University of Minnesota. FDA requested that additional preclinical toxicology be conducted prior to initiating clinical trials. The FDA also requested some additional information and clarifications on the manufacturing (CMC) and clinical packages. The requested additional information and clarifications were completed and incorporated by us into the IND in eCTD format. We filed the IND amendment in June 2018 and announced on November 1, 2018 that we had received notification from the FDA that the IND was open and the Company was authorized to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study with GTB-3550 in AML, MDS and severe mastocytosis. We expect to be in a position to begin the Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2019.

  GTB-C3550
 
 GTB-C3550 is a next-generation, follow-on, to our lead TriKE, GTB-3550. GTB-C3550 contains a modified CD16 moiety which has improved binding characteristics and enhanced tumor cell killing based on functional assays and animal models of AML. Using our platform technology, we substituted the anti-CD16 scFv arm in GTB-3550 with a novel humanized single-domain anti-CD16 antibody to create this second-generation molecule which may have improved functionality. Single-domain antibodies, such as GTB-C3550, typically have several advantages, including better stability and solubility, more resistance to pH changes, can better recognize hidden antigenic sites, lack of a VL portion thus preventing VH/VL mispairing and are suitable for construction of larger molecules. GTB-C3550 induced a potent increase in NK cell degranulation, measured by CD107a expression against HL-60 AML tumor targets when compared to our first- generation TriKE (70.75±3.65% vs. 30.75±5.05%). IFN production was similarly enhanced (29.2±1.8% vs. 6.55±1.07%). GTB-C3550 also exhibited a robust increase in NK cell proliferation (57.65±6.05% vs. 20.75±2.55%). GTB-3550 studies will help inform the development of GTB-C3550 which we expect will de-risk the GTB-C3550 program as data will be generated to make an informed decision on which, or both, will be brought into later phase studies.
 
  GTB-1615
 
 GTB-1615 is an example of our first-generation TetraKEs designed for the treatment of solid tumors. It is a single-chain fusion protein composed of CD16-IL15-EpCAM-CD133. EpCAM is found on many solid tumor cells of epithelial origin and CD133 is a marker for cancer stem cells. This TetraKE is designed to target not only the heterogeneous population of cancer cells found in solid tumors but also the cancer stem cells that are typically responsible for recurrences. Depending on the availability of drug supply, we hope to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2020.
 
  Central Nervous System
 
 Our CNS portfolio consists of in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Georgetown Translational Pharmaceuticals (“GTP”) on September 1, 2017, consisting of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies. These CNS assets address disease states such as chronic neuropathic pain (product candidate PainBrake, utilizing AccuBreak technology), myasthenia gravis (product candidate GTP-004) and motion sickness (product candidate GTP-011).
 
 In the 3rd quarter of 2018, the Company experienced changes in key senior management, led by the appointment of a CEO with extensive experience in oncology drug development. These changes resulted in the prioritization of immuno-oncology development candidates relative to the CNS development candidates acquired from Georgetown Translational Pharmaceuticals. In conjunction with these strategic changes, limited internal resources have delayed the development of the CNS IPR&D assets. The limited resources, changes in senior leadership, and favorable market conditions for immuno-oncology development candidates have resulted in the Company choosing to focus on development of its immuno-oncology portfolio. We are assessing our options to realize value from the CNS IPR&D assets.
 
 Our Strategy
 
 Our goal is to be a leader in immuno-oncology therapies targeting a broad range of indications including hematological malignancies, sarcoma and solid tumors and to generate value from our CNS product candidates. Key elements of our strategy are to:
 
  Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our bi-specific ADC, GTB-1550, in specific indications with a high unmet-medical need such as patients who are resistant or refractory to conventional treatment and also assess fast-to- market strategies in potential orphan indications
 
 Based upon promising clinical results from the initial GTB-1550 Phase 1 study, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 trial during the first quarter of 2017 for our most advanced oncology product candidate, GTB-1550, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory B- cell leukemias or lymphomas. In the Phase 1 study, of the nine patients who received GTB-1550 at the higher doses, two had durable complete responses in heavily pretreated patients. One of these patients, who had failed multiple previous treatment regimens, has been cancer free since the beginning of 2015.
 
 A Phase 1/2 trial of GTB-1550 in 18 patients was recently completed in patients with ALL/NHL. The FDA-approved clinical trial was conducted at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center. The data is currently being analyzed. We expect to submit data from this Phase 1/2 study for presentation/publication.
 
 We will also utilize our bi-specific ADC platform to generate novel ADCs with unique targets, linkers and warheads. We anticipate that this platform will give us the ability to rapidly construct novel ADCs with the potential to treat a wide range of cancers, including hematologic and solid tumors.

  Rapidly advanced our Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKEs), GTB-3550 and GTB-C3550
 
 Our TriKE and TetraKE product candidates have the potential to be groundbreaking therapies targeting a broad range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. We are preparing to study GTB-3550, an anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in AML, MDS and other myeloid malignancies. We expect to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2019 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. The Phase 1 trial will be a dose finding study. We expect this will be closely followed by Phase 2 trials to determine the most efficacious dosing and cycles with the aim to maximize efficacy while minimizing on-target, off-disease adverse events.
 
 GTB-C3550 contains a humanized single-domain anti-CD16 moiety which demonstrated improved binding characteristics and enhanced tumor cell killing based on functional assays and animal models of AML.
 
 We have designed GTB-3550 and GTB-C3550, if approved for marketing, to serve as a relatively safe, cost-effective, and easy-to-use therapies for resistant/relapsing AML or MDS which could also be combined with chemotherapy as frontline therapy thus targeting a broad AML/MDS market.
 
 GTB-C3550 is a next-generation, follow-on, to our lead TriKE, GTB-3550. GTB-3550 studies will help inform the development of GTB-C3550. We believe this will de-risk the GTB-C3550 program as the data being generated will help to make informed decisions on which, or both, will be brought into later phase studies and in which patient populations.
 
  Utilize our TriKE and TetraKE platform technologies to develop a robust pipeline of targeted immuno-oncology products targeting a wide range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors for development on our own and through potential collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies
 
 We are using our TriKE and TetraKE platforms with the intent to bring to market multiple, targeted, off-the-shelf therapies that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable and we are currently working with several third parties investigating the optimal expression system of the TriKEs and TetraKE constructs which we expect to be part of a process in which we are able to produce IND-ready moieties in approximately 90-120 days after the construct conceptual design. After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be rapidly advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
 
 We are currently evaluating over a dozen moieties and intend to announce additional clinical product candidates in the second half of 2019. Depending on the availability of drug supply, we hope to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2020.
 
 We believe our TriKEs and TetraKEs will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
 
  Continue our collaborative relationship with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, under a program led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller and become the leading NK-oriented immune-oncology company
 
 We believe that the TriKE and TetraKE constructs represent potentially groundbreaking innovations in immunotherapy. In July 2016 we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Minnesota to develop and commercialize cancer therapies using TriKE and TetraKE technology developed by researchers at the university to target NK cells to cancer.
 
 We believe TriKE and TetraKE therapeutics have the potential to significantly impact the standard of care for hematologic malignancies, sarcomas, as well as solid tumors. The direct engagement of the NK cell with the tumor cell via very specific receptors may increase the efficacy while decrease the toxicity seen with other forms of immunotherapies. If approved, we expect the TriKEs and TetraKEs will be able to be administered at cancer treatment facilities without the need for specialized centers or product-specific trained staff.
 
 We also intend to selectively evaluate and potentially acquire or enter into licensing or other agreements for technologies and/or product candidates that we believe would complement our oncology product candidates and platform technologies.
 
  Monetize our CNS programs through transactions with commercialization-oriented pharmaceutical companies and/or other transactions
 
 Our CNS portfolio consists of IPR&D assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of GTP on September 1, 2017, consisting of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies. These CNS assets address disease states such as chronic neuropathic pain, myasthenia gravis and motion sickness.

 B-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in B cells (a type of immune system cell). B-cell lymphomas may be either indolent (slow- growing) or aggressive (fast-growing). Non- Hodgkin lymphoma has an incidence rate of 19.4 per 100,000 per year and B-cell lymphomas make up most (about 85%) of NHL in the United States. There are many different types of B-cell non- Hodgkin lymphomas. These include Burkitt lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma.
 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
 
 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is an acute form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells, characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of immature white blood cells, known as lymphoblasts. In persons with ALL, lymphoblasts are overproduced in the bone marrow and continuously multiply, causing damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells (such as red and white blood cells and platelets) in the bone marrow and by spreading (infiltrating) to other organs.
 
 It is estimated that there will be 5,930 new cases of ALL reported in the United States in 2019 (ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2019). "Acute" is defined by the World Health Organization standards, in which greater than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is defined as having less than 20% blasts in the bone marrow. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is seen in both children and adults; the highest incidence is seen between ages 2 to 3 years (>90 cases per 1 million per year). ALL is the most common cancer diagnosed in children and represents approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children younger than 15 years. Among children with ALL, approximately 98% attain remission, and approximately 85% of patients aged 1 to 18 years with newly diagnosed ALL treated on current regimens are expected to be long-term event-free survivors, with over 90% surviving at 5 years.
 
  Multiple Myeloma
 
 Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that forms in white blood cells and will affect an estimated 32,110 people in 2019 in the U.S. causing about 12,960 deaths. Multiple myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is also characterized by destructive lytic bone lesions (rounded, punched-out areas of bone), diffuse osteoporosis, bone pain, and the production of abnormal proteins which accumulate in the urine. Anemia is also present in most multiple myeloma patients at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. Anemia in multiple myeloma is multifactorial and is secondary to bone marrow replacement by malignant plasma cells, chronic inflammation, relative erythropoietin deficiency, and vitamin deficiency. Plasma cell leukemia, a condition in which plasma cells comprise greater than 20% of peripheral leukocytes, is typically a terminal stage of multiple myeloma and is associated with short survival.
 Myeloid Leukemias
 
  Acute Myeloid Leukemia
 
 AML is a heterogeneous hematologic stem cell malignancy in adults with incidence rate of 4.3% per 100,000 populations. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 68 years. AML is an aggressive disease and is fatal without anti-leukemic treatment. AML is the most common form of adult leukemia with an estimated 21,450 new cases in 2019 in the U.S. These patients will require frontline therapy, usually chemotherapy including cytarabine and an anthracycline, a therapy that has not changed in over 40 years. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by dysplastic features of erythroid/myeloid/megakaryocytic lineages, progressive bone marrow failure, a varying percentage of blast cells, and enhanced risk to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. It is estimated that over 10,000 new cases of MDS are diagnosed each year and there are minimal treatment options; other estimates have put this number higher. In addition, the incidence of MDS is rising for unknown reasons.
 Solid Tumors
 
 In the United States, in 2019, it is estimated there will be approximately 1,762,450 new cases of cancer resulting in 606,880 deaths. Greater than 80% of these cancers will be classified as solid tumors. The most prevalent new cases of solid tumors being breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and bladder.

  Sarcomas
 
 A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops from certain tissues, like bone or muscle. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from soft tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. They can be found in any part of the body. Most of them develop in the arms or legs. They can also be found in the trunk, head and neck area, internal organs, and the area in back of the abdominal cavity (known as the retroperitoneum). Sarcomas are not common tumors, and most cancers are the type of tumors called carcinomas.
 
 The American Cancer Society's estimates for soft tissue sarcomas in the United States for 2019 are (these statistics include both adults and children): about 12,750 new soft tissue sarcomas will be diagnosed (7,240 cases in males and 5,510 cases in females). 5,270 Americans (2,840 males and 2,430 females) are expected to die of soft tissue sarcomas. The most common types of sarcoma in adults are undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma), liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Certain types occur more often in certain areas of the body than others. For example, leiomyosarcomas are the most common abdominal sarcoma, while liposarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma are most common in legs. But pathologists (doctors who specialize in diagnosing cancers by how they look under the microscope), may not always agree on the exact type of sarcoma. Sarcomas of uncertain type are very common.
