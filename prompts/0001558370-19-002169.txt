  Industry Background
 The number of people using the internet via computers, tablets, and smartphones continues to grow. Consumers are embracing online and mobile transactions and banking in increasing numbers. Organizations of all types have an increasing number of employees and business partners accessing protected resources from remote locations. New business paradigms such as these introduce new security risks for participants, especially banks, merchants, and other online and mobile service providers. Large and powerful criminal hacking organizations are launching more sophisticated hacking attacks with greater frequency. The criminal activities of private and state-sponsored hacking organizations have driven an increased need for security solutions and expansion of regulations requiring improved security measures to protect against hacking attacks and breaches. Several governments worldwide have recognized the risk associated with using username and password access for internet and mobile applications and have issued specific recommendations advocating multi-factor authentication for enhanced online and mobile banking security. We anticipate this trend will continue.
 We believe there are no reliable measurements of the total industry size or the industry growth rate for our security and eSignature products and services. However, we believe the market for authentication, anti-fraud and eSignature solutions will continue to grow driven by new government regulations, growing awareness of the impact of cyber-crime, and growth in electronic commerce. The issues driving growth are global. However, the rate of adoption in each country is a function of culture, competitive position, economic conditions, and use of technology.
 Our Background
 Our predecessor company, VASCO Corp., entered the data security business in 1991 through the acquisition of a controlling interest in ThumbScan, Inc., which we renamed as VASCO Data Security, Inc.
 In 1996, we expanded our computer security business by acquiring Lintel Security NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which included assets associated with the development of security tokens and security technologies for personal computers and computer networks. Also in 1996, we acquired Digipass NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which was also a developer of security tokens and security technologies. In 1997, the acquired entity was renamed VASCO Data Security NV/SA.
 In 1997, VASCO Data Security International, Inc. was incorporated and in 1998, we completed a registered exchange offer with the holders of the outstanding securities of VASCO Corp., becoming a publicly traded company.
 In 2006, we opened our international headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.
 In 2013, we acquired Cronto Limited (“CRONTO”), a provider of secure visual transaction authentication solutions for online banking. 
 In 2014, we acquired Risk IDS, a provider of risk analysis solutions to the banking community.

 OneSpan Sign (eSignature)
 OneSpan Sign supports a broad range of eSignature requirements from simple to complex, and from the occasional agreement to processing of tens of thousands of transactions. OneSpan Sign provides multiple deployment options including public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises, without compromising security or functionality. The solution is also available in a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) SaaS-level compliant cloud, allowing U.S. government agencies to implement eSignatures in the cloud and meet GSA security requirements.
 Customers can configure OneSpan Sign to reinforce their brand for a seamless signing experience. Each step of the eSignature workflow can be customized, from authentication to distribution and storage. OneSpan Sign also provides comprehensive and secure electronic evidence for the strongest legal protection by capturing both document and process-level evidence. This reduces the time and cost of gathering evidence and demonstrating legal and regulatory compliance. Electronic signature capabilities can be a critical component of the account opening and onboarding processes, providing a secure and user-friendly way to execute legally binding agreements.
 Trusted Identity Platform
 The Trusted Identity (TID) platform is an open architected, cloud-based platform that brings together OneSpan’s broad portfolio of security technologies, including intelligent adaptive authentication, risk analytics, mobile security, multi-factor authentication, biometrics, and orchestration to power solutions that secure users, devices, and transactions across the digital journey. The innovative approach of this platform delivers on simplicity with orchestration technology that easily integrates applications and services requirements via a single interface while constantly protecting sensitive data through an encrypted client/server secure channel.  Intelligent Adaptive Authentication
 Intelligent Adaptive Authentication is a cloud-based solution that enables banks and other financial institutions to secure users, devices and transactions while providing an enhanced customer experience. It is powered by the TID platform and leverages advanced risk analytics, mobile security, multi-factor authentication, biometrics, and other technologies that enable the real-time analysis and scoring of vast and disparate data across channels. This risk score drives a precise level of authentication security for each unique transaction which ensures a positive customer experience, while safe-guarding transactions and sensitive customer data. This helps institutions reduce fraud and drive growth through higher customer loyalty and increased use of bank services. Risk Analytics
 Risk Analytics is a comprehensive anti-fraud solution designed to help banks and other financial institutions improve the speed and accuracy of detecting known and emerging fraud across online and mobile channels. A component of the TID platform, which includes machine learning technology, the solution analyzes vast amounts of user, device, and transaction data in real time to provide a comprehensive risk assessment. It enables institutions to take a proactive approach to fraud prevention while removing major points of friction for end users. Cross-channel, prebuilt rules complement this score and allow fraud experts to make decisions on alerts or link to automated business processes such as step-up authentication. The solution can be implemented in combination with Mobile Security Suite to provide integrated trust with minimal impact on the end user experience. It can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises. Verification Hub
 Verification Hub (V-Hub) is a cloud-based digital identity verification solution that provides access to multiple third-party verification services – all through a single API. Instead of integrating multiple solutions, organizations can reap the benefits of a single integration, SLA, and vendor through OneSpan. Capabilities include ID document verification to capture the ID (e.g., driver’s license, passport) and verify its authenticity in real-time, as well as facial comparison (“selfie”) features to establish that the individual presenting the ID is the same person whose portrait appears on the ID.

 V-Hub enables banks and other financial institutions to verify the identity of unknown individuals to support digital account opening, lending, and financing processes. The solution gives organizations the ability to select the best verification processes for their use case and channel to maximize pass rates, minimize fraud, and comply with Know Your Customer requirements. The multi-layered approach to identity verification enables failover in the event of a verification failure or provider unavailability, which in turn reduces customer abandonment. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, design and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights. In particular, we hold several patents in the U.S. and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. These patents expire between now and more than 10 years from now. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe and other countries. The majority of our issued and pending patents cover our DIGIPASS product line. We believe these patents to be valuable property rights and we rely on the strength of our patents and on trade secret law to protect our proprietary technology. We furthermore have registrations for most of our trademarks in most of the markets where we sell the corresponding products and services and registrations of the designs of many of our hardware products primarily in the EU and China. To the extent that we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed upon, we intend to assert vigorously our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, pursuing all available legal remedies. Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts historically have been, and will continue to be, concentrated on solution enhancement, new technology development, and related new software introductions. We employ a team of full-time engineers and, from time to time, also engage independent engineering firms to conduct non-strategic product development efforts on our behalf. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we incurred expenses of $32.2 million, $23.1 million, and $23.2 million, respectively, for research and development. Production
 Our security hardware DIGIPASS products are manufactured by third party manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we issue. Our hardware DIGIPASS products are made primarily from commercially available electronic components purchased globally. Our software solutions are produced in-house or develop by third parties and sold under license.
 Hardware DIGIPASS products utilize commercially available programmable microprocessors purchased from several suppliers. The microprocessors are the most important components of our security authenticators that are not commodity items readily available on the open market. Some microprocessors are single sourced. Orders of microprocessors generally require a lead-time of 12-16 weeks. We attempt to maintain a sufficient inventory of all parts to handle short-term increases in orders.
 Large orders that would significantly deplete our inventory are typically required to be placed with more than twelve weeks of lead-time, allowing us to make appropriate arrangements with our suppliers. We purchase microprocessors and arrange for shipment to third parties for assembly and testing in accordance with our design specifications. The majority of our DIGIPASS products are manufactured by four independent vendors domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau with production facilities in mainland China. Purchases are made on a volume purchase order basis. We supply product test equipment at the point of assembly. We maintain a local team in China to conduct quality control and quality assurance procedures. Periodic visits are conducted by our personnel for quality management, assembly process review, and supplier relations.
 Competition
 The market for digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity solutions is very competitive and, like most technology-driven markets, is subject to rapid change and constantly evolving solutions and services. Our

anti-fraud products are designed to allow authorized users access to a computing environment or application, in some cases using patented technology, as a replacement for or supplement to a static password. Although certain of our security technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer anti-fraud solutions that compete with us for market share. Our main competitors in our anti-fraud markets are Gemalto and RSA Security, a subsidiary of Dell Technologies. There are many other companies, such as Transmit Security, Symantec, and Early Warning that offer competing services. In addition to these companies, we face competition from many small authentication solution providers, many of whom offer new technologies and niche solutions such as biometric or behavioral analysis. We believe that competition in this market is likely to intensify as a result of increasing demand for security products. Our primary competitors for electronic signature solutions include DocuSign and Adobe Systems. Both companies are significantly larger than us. In addition to these companies, there are dozens of smaller and regional providers of electronic signing solutions.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity, as well as electronic signatures include the strength and effectiveness of the solution, technical features, ease of use, quality and reliability, customer service and support, brand recognition, customer base, distribution channels, and the total cost of ownership of the solution. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors.
 Some of our present and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing, and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, or to deliver competitive products at a lower end-user price. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Accordingly, we have forged, and will continue to forge, our own partnerships to offer a broader range of products and capabilities to the market.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales staff coordinates sales activity through both our sales channels and those of our partners making direct sales calls either alone or with the sales personnel of our partners. Our sales staff also provides product education seminars to sales and technical personnel of resellers and distributors with whom we have working relationships and to potential end-users of our products.
 Our sales force is able to offer customers a choice of an on-site implementation using our on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform.
 Part of our expanded selling effort includes approaching our partners to find additional applications for our security products. In addition, our marketing plan calls for the identification of new business opportunities that may require enhanced security or areas where we do not currently market our products. Our efforts also include various activities to increase market awareness of solutions as well as preparation and dissemination of white papers explaining how our security products can add value or otherwise be beneficial.
 Customers and Markets
 We generally focus our sales and marketing efforts in three primary areas. The first is financial institutions where the majority of our revenue is derived. This segment includes banks, credit unions, and online banks. This is our primary market. We believe there are substantial opportunities for future growth in the financial vertical as our solution portfolio expands and we deliver additional capabilities targeted specifically at identifying and mitigating online and mobile banking fraud. We also sell to the enterprise market segment which consists primarily of businesses seeking secure internal and remote network access. We sell to these businesses mostly through distribution and resellers. Our strategy is to leverage products developed for the banking market in the enterprise market as the hacking attacks in both

markets have many similarities. We also target the government market segment in select regions around the globe. Our customer base includes a number of government organizations.
 Our top 10 customers contributed 24%, 27%, and 36%, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. 
 A significant portion of our sales is denominated in foreign currencies and changes in exchange rates impact results of operations. To mitigate exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against operating expenses being incurred in that currency. For additional information regarding how currency fluctuations can affect our business, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”
 We also experience seasonality or variation across the year in our markets. These trends can include the summer months, particularly in Europe, or the second half of the fiscal year is generally higher than the first half in terms of sales.
 Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations
 For financial information regarding OneSpan, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a single operating segment for all our products and operations. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of revenue and long-lived assets between U.S. and foreign operations. Employees
