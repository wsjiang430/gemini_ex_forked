ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development
Cardinal Ethanol, LLC is an Indiana limited liability company formed on February 7, 2005 with the name of Indiana Ethanol, LLC. On September 27, 2005, we changed our name to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Cardinal” and the “Company” refer to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. We began producing ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at the plant in November 2008 (the "Ethanol Division"). In addition, in 2017 we added a facility to allow us to procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our new grain operations (the "Trading Division"). 
On November 6, 2018, we experienced an explosion in one of our distillers grains silos. There were no injuries related to the incident and the damage was limited to the distillers grains silos and the associated materials handling equipment. Operations at the plant were temporarily suspended for four days pending an evaluation and assessment of the situation. The plant resumed operations but did not return to full production rates until mid to late December. We received final quotes to repair the damage to the silo of $1,794,000 and our insurance carrier made a commitment to pay us that amount. However, our board of directors voted to abandon the damaged silo and decided to instead build additional flat storage in its place due to the fact that flat storage is likely to be a safer alternative to a silo. We expect that the flat storage will be completed during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020 at an estimated cost of approximately $1,900,000.
On February 19, 2019, we announced that our board of directors had decided to explore strategic options including the potential sale of our facility. In connection with these activities, we suspended all trading through the FNC Ag Stock, LLC Unit Trading Bulletin Board, a private online matching service, on the same date. On June 21, 2019, we announced that we are no longer actively pursuing a sale of the facility and resumed trading effective July 1, 2019. 
Reportable Operating Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Based on the nature of the products, services and operations and the expected financial results, we review our operations within the following two separate operating segments: (1) ethanol production through our Ethanol Division; and (2) trading of agricultural grains through our Trading Division. We currently do not have or anticipate we will have any other lines of business or other significant sources of revenue other than the sale of ethanol, distillers’ grains, corn oil and and the trading of agricultural grains.  
Ethanol Division
In August 2010, we obtained a new Title V air permit allowing us to increase our annual ethanol production to 140 million gallons compared to 110 million gallons under our previous permit. Our annual ethanol production for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 decreased to approximately 130 million gallons due to lower ethanol production during our first quarter of 2019 as a result of a temporary plant shut down and decreased production rates related to an explosion in one of our distillers grains silos. 
Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We market and sell ethanol and its co-products (distillers grains and corn oil) primarily in the continental United States using third party marketers. Murex, LLC markets all of our ethanol. Our distillers grains are marketed by CHS, Inc. We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers.    
Principal Products 
The principal products in our Ethanol Division are fuel-grade ethanol and distillers grains. In addition, we are extracting corn oil and capturing a portion of the raw carbon dioxide we produce for sale. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total ethanol division revenue which is attributed to each of our products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2019 | | Fiscal Year 2018 | | Fiscal Year 2017
Ethanol | 77 | % | | 77 | % | 83 | %
Distillers Grains | 19 | % | | 19 | % | 13 | %
Corn Oil | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Carbon Dioxide | < 1% | | | < 1 % | | < 1% | 

Ethanol
Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. The ethanol we produce is manufactured from corn. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates current domestic ethanol production capacity of approximately 16.6 billion gallons with approximately 7% of that capacity idled.
An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called “beer,” which contains about 10% alcohol and 90% water. The “beer” is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant to make the product unfit for human consumption and commercially saleable. 
Ethanol can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Approximately 95% of all ethanol is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Used as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol provides a means to control carbon monoxide emissions in large metropolitan areas. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally the wholesale gasoline marketer or blender. The principal markets for our ethanol are petroleum terminals in the northeastern United States.
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, beef, poultry and swine industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distillers grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles ("DWS"), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles ("DMWS") and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles ("DDGS"). DWS is processed corn mash that contains approximately 70% moisture. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the immediate vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture. DMWS have a slightly longer shelf life of approximately ten days and are often sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS that has been dried to 10% to 12% moisture. DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to an ethanol plant. 
Corn Oil
Since November 2008, we have been separating some of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. We have worked hard to improve corn oil production levels and continue to fine tune the operation of our equipment to further increase production rates. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses. 
Carbon Dioxide
Since March 2010, we have been selling some of the carbon dioxide gas produced at the plant. 
Ethanol, Distillers Grains, Carbon Dioxide and Corn Oil Markets
As described below in "Distribution Methods," we market and distribute our ethanol and distillers grains through third parties. Our ethanol and distillers grains marketers make all decisions, in consultation with management, with regard to where our products are marketed. Our ethanol and distillers grains are predominately sold in the domestic market. Specifically, we ship a substantial portion of the ethanol we produce to the New York harbor. We expect our ethanol and distillers grains marketers to explore all markets for our products, including export markets, and believe that there is some potential for increased international 
5

sales of our products. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 
 Over the past year, exports of ethanol have increased with Brazil receiving the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States and Canada in second place. India, the Philippines and South Korea have also been top destinations. However, tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States have reduced demand from these countries and the potential for the imposition of tariffs by other countries due to trade disputes with the United States, may reduce overall ethanol export demand, which could have a negative effect on domestic ethanol prices. In addition, ethanol export demand is typically more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. For example, a strong U.S. Dollar is a force that may negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States.
Historically, the United States ethanol industry has exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China. The imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by China over the past three years has resulted in a significant decline in demand from China requiring United States producers to seek out alternative markets. Over the past year, Mexico has been a top destination with Canada, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam receiving notable amounts. However, recent trade disputes with other countries have created additional uncertainty as to future export demand. 
As described below in "Distribution Methods," we sell carbon dioxide to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ("Air Products") and we market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers in the domestic market. 
Distribution Methods
Our ethanol plant is located near Union City, Indiana in Randolph County. We selected the site because of its proximity to existing ethanol consumption and accessibility to road and rail transportation. Our site is in close proximity to rail and major highways that connect to major population centers such as Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, New York and Chicago. 
Ethanol 
We entered into an Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex, LLC ("Murex") for the purpose of marketing and distributing all of the ethanol we produce at the plant. The initial term of the agreement was five years commencing on the date of first delivery of ethanol with automatic renewal for one year terms thereafter unless otherwise terminated by either party. The agreement may be terminated due to the insolvency or intentional misconduct of either party or upon the default of one of the parties as set forth in the agreement. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Murex markets all of our ethanol unless we choose to sell a portion at a retail fueling station owned by us or one of our affiliates. Murex pays to us the purchase price invoiced to the third-party purchaser less all resale costs, taxes paid by Murex and Murex's commission. Murex has agreed to purchase on its own account and at market price any ethanol which it is unable to sell to a third party purchaser. Murex has promised to use its best efforts to obtain the best purchase price available for our ethanol. In addition, Murex has agreed to promptly notify us of any and all price arbitrage opportunities. Under the agreement, Murex is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our ethanol. This agreement provides for an annual cap on the commission paid to Murex. Effective November 18, 2018, we further amended our agreement to provide for the payment of the commission to Murex to be calculated on each net gallon of ethanol taken under the agreement. The amendment provides that Murex will handle all RIN activity, submit regulatory reports, and lease us a minimum number of tank cars for rail transportation and manage the tank car fleet in exchange for a monthly payment. The amendment also extends the term of the agreement until November 30, 2022, to be renewed thereafter automatically for one-year periods unless either party gives notice of non-renewal. 
Distillers Grains 
We have entered into an agreement with CHS, Inc. to market all distillers grains we produce at the plant. CHS, Inc. is a diversified energy, grains and foods company owned by farmers, ranchers and cooperatives. CHS, Inc. provides products and services ranging from grain marketing to food processing to meet the needs of its customers around the world. We receive a percentage of the selling price actually received by CHS, Inc. in marketing our distillers grains to its customers. The agreement remains in effect unless otherwise terminated by either party with 120 days notice. Under the agreement, CHS, Inc. is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our distillers grains. 
6

Corn Oil
We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers. Our corn oil is mainly used as an animal feed ingredient and as a feedstock in biodiesel production.
Carbon Dioxide 
We have entered into an agreement with Air Products under which Air Products purchases a portion of the carbon dioxide gas produced at our plant. In addition, we entered into a Site Lease Agreement with Air Products under which Air Products leases a portion of our property, on which it is operating a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant. Under the agreement, Air Products pays us for a minimum of 98,700 tons each year or approximately $493,500 annually. 
Federal Ethanol Supports and Governmental Regulation
Federal Ethanol Supports 
The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is required by statute to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation. The statutory volumes and the EPA's volumes for 2014 through 2019 (in billion gallons) are as follows: 

 | | Total Renewable Fuel Volume Requirement | Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol
2014 | Statutory | 18.15 | 14.40 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 16.28 | 13.61 
2015 | Statutory | 20.50 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 16.93 | 14.05 
2016 | Statutory | 22.25 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 18.11 | 14.50 
2017 | Statutory | 24.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 11/30/2016 | 19.28 | 15.00 
2018 | Statutory | 26.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 11/30/2017 | 19.29 | 15.00 
2019 | Statutory | 28.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 11/30/2018 | 19.92 | 15.00 


On July 5, 2019, the EPA released a proposed rule to set the renewable volume obligation for 2020. The EPA proposes to set the total volume obligation at 20.04 billion gallons of which 15.0 billion gallon could be met by corn-based ethanol. A public hearing on the proposed rule was held in July and the public comment period expired on August 30, 2019. The final rule 
7

was expected to be issued in November 2019. However, on October 15, 2019, the EPA released a supplemental notice seeking additional comment on a proposed rule on adjustments to the way that annual renewable fuel percentages are calculated. The supplemental notice was issued in response to an announcement on October 4, 2019, by President Trump of a proposed plan to require refiners not exempt from the rules to blend additional gallons of ethanol to make up for the gallons exempted by the EPA's expanded use of waivers to small refineries. The effect of these waivers is that the refinery is no longer required to earn or purchase blending credits, known as RINs, negatively affecting ethanol demand and resulting in lower ethanol prices. The proposed plan was expected to calculate the volume that refiners were required to blend by using a three-year average of exempted gallons. However, the EPA proposed to use a three-year average to account for the reduction in demand resulting from the waivers using the number of gallons of relief recommended by the United States Department of Energy. A public hearing on the proposed rule was held October 30 and the public comment period will expire on November 30, 2019. 
In February 2010, the EPA issued new regulations governing the RFS. These new regulations have been called RFS2. The most controversial part of RFS2 involves what is commonly referred to as the lifecycle analysis of green house gas emissions. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in green house gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% green house gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in green house gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in green house gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. The scientific method of calculating these green house gas reductions has been a contentious issue. Many in the ethanol industry were concerned that corn based ethanol would not meet the 20% green house gas reduction requirement based on certain parts of the environmental impact model that many in the ethanol industry believed was scientifically suspect. However, RFS2 as adopted by the EPA provides that corn-based ethanol from modern ethanol production processes does meet the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS up to 115,000,000 gallons annually due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle green house gas requirement. Therefore, we are not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle green house gas reductions for a significant amount of our production. Certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. 
Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. In 2016, gasoline demand in the United States was approximately 143 billion gallons. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol is 14.3 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the “blending wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends. 
 In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although there have been significant steps towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. Previously, different gasoline blendstocks were required at certain times of the year due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which prevented E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. In May of 2019, the EPA issued a final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15.

A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. 
Effect of Governmental Regulation
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that 
8

could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. For example, changes in the environmental regulations regarding the required oxygen content of automobile emissions could have an adverse effect on the ethanol industry. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions affecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance. 
In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. However, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.    
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $93,000 complying with environmental laws. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. 
Competition
Ethanol
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of whom have greater resources than we do. Following the significant growth during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that there are approximately 208 ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 16.6 billion gallons of ethanol with seven plants under expansion or construction with capacity to produce approximately an additional 270 million gallons. However, the Renewable Fuels Association estimates that approximately 7% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States is idled. 
Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. We have also experienced increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. The ethanol industry is continuing to consolidate where a few larger ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities and are controlling a larger portion of the United States ethanol production. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operation margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. 
The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Flint Hill Resources LP, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce.

Green Plains Renewable Energy | 1,111 
Flint Hill Resources LP | 840 


The ethanol industry in the United States experienced increased competition from ethanol produced outside of the United States during 2012 which was likely the result of the expiration of the tariff on imported ethanol which expired on December 31, 2011. Although ethanol imports have since decreased, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again that could negatively impact demand for ethanol produced in the United States which could result in lower operating margins. 
We also anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock is cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice, straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Several companies and researchers have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and a few companies in the United States have begun producing on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process. 
Our ethanol plant also competes with producers of other gasoline additives having similar octane and oxygenate values as ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and alternative ethanol production methods are also continually under development. The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to market other additives, to develop alternative products, and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. These companies also have sufficient resources to begin production of ethanol should they choose to do so. 
 A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While in the past there were a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been an increased focus on developing these recharging stations which have made electric car technology more widely available. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
Distillers Grains 
Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Ethanol plants produced approximately 41 million metric tons of distillers grains in 2018. 
The primary consumers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine and poultry markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from it. The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete 
10

with three other feed formulations: corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. To produce 135 million gallons of ethanol per year, our ethanol plant needs approximately 47 million bushels of corn per year, or approximately 129,000 bushels per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. Traditionally, corn grown in the area of the plant site has been fed locally to livestock or exported for feeding or processing and/or overseas export sales. 
The price at which we purchase corn will depend on prevailing market prices. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors affecting grain commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs and foreign purchases. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to grain prices, ethanol producers are generally not able to compensate for increases in the cost of grain feedstock through adjustments in prices charged for their ethanol. We therefore anticipate that our plant's profitability will be negatively impacted during periods of high grain prices. 
In an attempt to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on operating profits, we take hedging positions in corn futures markets. Hedging means protecting the price at which we buy corn and the price at which we will sell our products in the future. It is a way to attempt to reduce the risk caused by price fluctuation. The effectiveness of hedging activities is dependent upon, among other things, the cost of corn and our ability to sell sufficient amounts of ethanol and distillers grains to utilize all of the corn subject to the futures contracts. Hedging activities can result in costs to us because price movements in grain contracts are highly volatile and are influenced by many factors beyond our control. These costs may be significant. 
High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. Corn prices were higher during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018 due primarily to concerns that the size of the 2019 crop would be negatively affected by substandard spring planting conditions resulting from wet weather and flooding in the upper Midwest. On October 10, 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") released a report estimating the 2019 corn crop in the United States at approximately 13.8 billion bushels, down 4% from last year's production, with yields averaging 168.4 bushels per acre. The USDA forecasted area harvested for grain at 81.8 million acres, down less than1% from 2018. The Indiana corn crop is estimated to be approximately 793 million bushels, down 20% from 2018. Yields in Indiana are expected to be approximately 162 bushels per acre, down approximately 14% from 2018. Management will continue to monitor the availability of corn in our area. 
Utilities
We engaged Capstone Energy Services, LLC ("Capstone") to provide us with on-going energy management services. Capstone manages the procurement and delivery of energy to our location. They assist with strategy development, cost analysis, risk management, supply management and reporting services in exchange for a monthly fee. The agreement commenced on June 1, 2015, and continues for one year unless earlier terminated due to an event of default. Following the expiration of the initial one-year term, the agreement will be on a month-to-month basis and may be terminated by either party upon sixty days prior written notice. 
Natural Gas 
Natural gas is also an important input commodity to our manufacturing process. Our natural gas usage for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was approximately 0.5% less MMBTUs than for last fiscal year, constituting approximately 4.4% of our total costs of goods sold. We are using natural gas to produce process steam and to dry our distillers grain products to a moisture content at which they can be stored for long periods of time, and can be transported greater distances, so that we can market the product to broader livestock markets, including poultry and swine markets in the continental United States. 
On March 20, 2007, we entered into a Long-Term Transportation Service Contract for Redelivery of Natural Gas with Ohio Valley Gas Corporation ("Ohio Valley"). Under the contract, Ohio Valley receives, transports and redelivers natural gas to us for all of our natural gas requirements up to a maximum of 100,000 therms per purchase gas day and our estimated annual natural gas requirements of 34,000,000 therms. For all gas received for and redelivered to us by Ohio Valley, we pay a throughput rate in the amount of $0.0138 per therm for the first five years of the contract term, and $0.0138 increased by the compounded inflation rate as established and determined by the U.S. Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for Transportation for the following five years. In addition, we pay a service charge for all gas received for and redelivered to us by Ohio Valley in the amount of $750 per delivery meter per billing cycle per month for the first five years of the contract term and $750 increased by

the compounded inflation rate over the initial rate as established and determined by the U.S. Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for Transportation for the following five years. The initial term of the contract is ten years. Provided neither party terminates the contract, the contract will automatically renew for a series of not more than three consecutive one year periods.
Electricity
We require a significant amount of electrical power to operate the plant. On May 2, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Indiana Michigan Power Company to furnish our electric energy. The initial term of the contract was 30 months from the time service is commenced and continues thereafter unless terminated by either party with 12 months written notice. We pay Indiana Michigan Power Company monthly pursuant to their standard rates. 
Water
We require a significant supply of water. Engineering specifications show our plant's water requirements to be approximately 774 gallons per minute, 1.1 million gallons per day, depending on the quality of water. We have assessed our water needs and available supply and have determined that we have an adequate supply. Union City Water Works is supplying the water necessary to operate our plant. 
         Much of the water used in our ethanol plant is recycled back into the process. There are, however, certain areas of production where fresh water is needed. Those areas include boiler makeup water and cooling tower water. Boiler makeup water is treated on-site to minimize all elements that will harm the boiler and recycled water cannot be used for this process. Cooling tower water is deemed non-contact water because it does not come in contact with the mash, and, therefore, can be regenerated back into the cooling tower process. The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation. Much of the water can be recycled back into the process, which minimizes the discharge water. This will have the long-term effect of lowering wastewater treatment costs. Many new plants today are zero or near zero effluent discharge facilities. Our plant design incorporates the ICM/Phoenix Bio-Methanator wastewater treatment process resulting in a zero discharge of plant process water. 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM, Inc. was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant. In addition, we were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain corn oil technologies necessary to extract corn oil during our plant operations. 
Seasonality of Ethanol Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
As discussed above, we have entered into a marketing agreement with Murex for the purpose of marketing and distributing our ethanol and have engaged CHS, Inc. for the purpose of marketing and distributing our distillers grains. We rely on Murex for the sale and distribution of our ethanol and CHS, Inc. for the sale and distribution of our distillers grains. Therefore, although there are other marketers in the industry, we are highly dependent on Murex and CHS, Inc. for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of Murex or CHS, Inc. as our marketing agent for our ethanol and distillers grains respectively could have a significant negative impact on our revenues.
Trading Division 
We procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our Trading Division which began operations at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. To provide funding for the construction of this facility, we obtained a construction loan in the amount of $10,000,000 which converted to term debt effective December 31, 2017 (the "Grain Loadout Facility Loan"). Please refer to Item 8- Financial Statements, Note 9- Bank Financing for additional details.

Principal Products

We have and expect to continue to buy primarily soybeans and corn from producers relying principally on forward purchase contracts to ensure an adequate supply of grain. However, we occasionally also purchase grain the day of delivery. Grain prices are typically comprised of futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME") and local basis adjustments. 
Grain Markets and Distribution Methods
Grain shipments are made by rail and truck. Our sales are made to grain processors and export markets in the southeastern United States. Our grain sales are generally made by contract for delivery in a future period. Income is expected to be earned on grain bought and sold, the appreciation or depreciation in the basis value of the grain held and the appreciation or depreciation between the futures contract months.
Competition
We primarily compete in the purchase of grain on a local or regional basis although there are some larger national and international companies that maintain regional grain purchase and storage facilities. We compete in the sale of grain with other public and private grain brokers, elevator operators and farmer owned cooperatives. Competition is based primarily on price, service and reliability. 
Seasonality of Grain Purchases and Sales
Our grain operations are somewhat seasonal in nature in that the grain we procure is harvested in October and November. The largest portion of the grain is delivered by producers in the fall although we buy and sell a significant portion of our grain throughout the year. 
Risk Management
We manage the futures price risk of changing commodity prices by entering into exchange-traded futures contracts on the CME. The CME is a regulated commodity futures exchange that maintains futures markets for the grain we trade. Futures prices are determined by worldwide supply and demand. 
We entered into a Risk Management Agreement with John Stewart & Associates ("JS&A") under which JS&A provides risk management and related services pertaining to grain hedging, grain pricing information, aid in purchase of grain, and assistance in risk management as it pertains to ethanol, co-products and soybeans. In exchange for JS&A's risk management services, we pay JS&A a fee of $1,500 per month. We are currently on a month to month basis for this contract with JS&A. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time upon written notice. 
We also entered into an agreement with Advance Trading to assist us with hedging corn, ethanol, natural gas and soybeans. We pay them a fee of $3,000 per month for these services. The term of the agreement is month-to-month and may be terminated by either party at any time upon proper notice. 
We also entered into an agreement with Commodity & Ingredient Hedging, LLC to evaluate and provide marketing advice and margin management related to cash sales and purchases, forward contracts and exchange-traded futures and options. We pay an annual fee of $12,000 in exchange for these services. The agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal as provided in the agreement.
Employees

We have 59 full-time employees as of November 22, 2019. 
Working Capital
We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the Ethanol Division and for purchases of grain commodities for the Trading Division. Our primary source of working capital is cash we generate from our operations along with our Declining Loan and our Revolving Credit Loan with our primary lender First National Bank of Omaha. The Declining Loan provides $5,000,000 in total for us to use on capital projects allowing us to preserve our working capital at a sufficient level. At September 30, 2019, we have approximately $15,000,000 available to draw on the Revolving Credit Loan
