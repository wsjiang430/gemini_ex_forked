Item 1. Business
Overview
Founded in 1994, Artisan is an investment management firm focused on providing high valued added, active investment strategies to sophisticated clients globally. Our autonomous investment teams manage a broad range of U.S., non-U.S. and global investment strategies that are diversified by asset class, market cap and investment style. 
Since our founding, we have maintained a business model that is designed to maximize our ability to produce attractive investment results for our clients, and we believe this model has contributed to our success in doing so. We focus on attracting, retaining and developing talented investment professionals by creating an environment in which each investment team is provided ample resources and support, transparent and direct financial incentives, and a high degree of investment autonomy. Each of our investment teams is led by one or more experienced portfolio managers and applies its own unique investment philosophy and process. We believe this autonomous structure promotes independent analysis and accountability among our investment professionals, which we believe promotes superior investment results. 
The following table sets forth our revenues and our ending and average assets under management for the periods noted:

 | For the Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
 | (in millions) 
Total revenues | $ | 829 | | $ | 796 | $ | 721 
Ending assets under management | $ | 96,224 | | $ | 115,494 | $ | 96,845
Average assets under management | $ | 113,769 | | $ | 108,754 | $ | 96,281

Additional information regarding our revenues and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, as well as our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Each of our investment strategies is designed to have a clearly articulated, consistent and replicable investment process that is well-understood by clients and managed to achieve long-term performance. Over our firm’s history, we have created new investment strategies that can use a broad array of securities, instruments, and techniques (which we call degrees of freedom) to differentiate returns and manage risk. 
We launch a new strategy only when we believe it has the potential to achieve superior investment performance in an area that we believe will have sustained client demand at attractive fee rates over the long term. We strive to maintain the integrity of the investment process followed in each of our strategies by rigorous adherence to the investment parameters we have communicated to our clients. We also carefully monitor our investment capacity in each investment strategy. We believe that management of our investment capacity protects our ability to manage assets successfully, which protects the interests of our clients and, in the long term, protects our ability to retain client assets and maintain our profit margins. In order to better achieve our long-term goals, we are willing to close a strategy to new investors or otherwise take action to slow or restrict its growth, even though our short-term results may be impacted.
In addition to our investment teams, we have a management team that is focused on our business objectives of achieving profitable growth, expanding our investment capabilities, diversifying the source of our assets under management, delivering superior client service, developing our investment teams into investment franchises with multiple decision-makers and investment strategies, and maintaining the firm’s fiduciary mindset and culture of compliance. Our management team supports our investment management capabilities and manages our operational infrastructure, which allows our investment professionals to focus primarily on making investment decisions and generating returns for our clients.
We offer our investment management capabilities primarily to institutions and through intermediaries that operate with institutional-like decision-making processes by means of separate accounts and pooled vehicles. We access traditional institutional clients primarily through relationships with investment consultants. We access other institutional-like investors primarily through consultants, alliances with major defined contribution/401(k) platforms and relationships with financial advisors and broker-dealers. We derive essentially all of our revenues from investment management fees, which primarily are based on a specified percentage of clients’ average assets under management. These fees are determined by the investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements that are terminable by clients upon short notice or no notice. 
Investment Teams
We offer clients a broad range of actively managed investment strategies diversified by asset class, market cap, region and investment style. Each strategy is managed by one of the investment teams described below. 
The table below sets forth total assets under management and certain performance information for our investment teams and strategies as of December 31, 2018.

(1) Value-added since inception date is the amount in basis points by which the average annual gross composite return of each of our strategies has outperformed or underperformed the broad-based market index most commonly used by our clients to compare the performance of the relevant strategy since its inception date. Value-added for periods less than one year are not annualized. The broad-based market indices used to compute the value added since inception date for each of our strategies are as follows: Non-U.S. Growth Strategy / Non-U.S. Value Strategy-MSCI EAFE Index; Global Equity Strategy / Global Opportunities Strategy / Global Value Strategy / Global Discovery Strategy-MSCI ACWI Index; Non-U.S. Small-Mid Growth Strategy-MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index; U.S. Mid-Cap Growth Strategy / U.S. Mid-Cap Value Strategy-Russell Midcap® Index; U.S. Small-Cap Growth Strategy-Russell 2000® Index; Value Equity Strategy-Russell 1000® Index; Developing World Strategy / Emerging Markets Strategy-MSCI Emerging Markets Index; High Income Strategy-ICE BofAML US High Yield Master II Total Return Index; Thematic Strategy-S&P® 500 Index. Unlike the ICE BofAML US High Yield Master II Total Return Index, the Artisan High Income strategy may hold loans and other security types. At times, this causes material differences in relative performance.
(2) The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-year, five-year, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Ratings metrics. 
(3) Effective December 4, 2018, the Non-U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy was re-named the Non-U.S. Small-Mid Growth strategy and the strategy was given increased degrees of freedom to invest in both small and mid-cap companies around the world. In connection with that change, the strategy’s prior composite was terminated, and a new composite began on January 1, 2019. As a result, performance information for the strategy has been omitted from this presentation. 

Growth Team
Our Growth team, which was formed in 1997 and is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, manages four investment strategies: Global Opportunities, Global Discovery, U.S. Mid-Cap Growth and U.S. Small-Cap Growth. James D. Hamel, Matthew H. Kamm, Craigh A. Cepukenas, and Jason L. White are the portfolio managers of all four strategies. Mr. Hamel is the lead portfolio manager of the Global Opportunities strategy; Mr. White is the lead portfolio manager of the Global Discovery strategy; Mr. Kamm is the lead portfolio manager of the U.S. Mid-Cap Growth strategy; and Mr. Cepukenas is the lead portfolio manager of the U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy.

Global Equity Team
Our Global Equity team was formed in 1996 and is primarily based in San Francisco and New York. The Global Equity team manages three investment strategies: Global Equity, Non-U.S. Growth, and Non-U.S. Small-Mid Growth. 
Mark L. Yockey serves as portfolio manager of the Global Equity and Non-U.S. Growth strategies. Charles-Henri Hamker and Andrew J. Euretig are also portfolio managers of the Global Equity strategy and associate portfolio managers of the Non-U.S. Growth strategy. 
Prior to October 15, 2018, the Non-U.S. Small-Mid Growth strategy (formerly, the Non-U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy) was managed by Mr. Yockey and Mr. Hamker and was closed to most new investors and client relationships. Effective October 15, Rezo Kanovich became sole portfolio manager of the strategy, and the strategy re-opened to new investors. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the strategy was given increased degrees of freedom to invest in both small and mid-cap companies around the world and the strategy was re-named the Non-U.S. Small-Mid Growth strategy to reflect this evolution. In connection with these changes, the strategy’s prior composite was terminated and a new composite began on January 1, 2019. As a result of the termination of the prior composite, historical performance information has been omitted from the table below.

U.S. Value Team
Our U.S. Value team, which was formed in 1997 and is based in Atlanta and Chicago, manages two investment strategies: Value Equity and U.S. Mid-Cap Value. James C. Kieffer, Thomas A. Reynolds, Daniel L. Kane and, effective January 31, 2019, Craig Inman are the portfolio managers for both strategies.

Global Value and International Value Teams
Effective October 1, 2018, what was then called the Global Value team separated into two distinct and autonomous investment teams—the Global Value team led by Daniel J. O’Keefe and the International Value team led by N. David Samra. Prior to October 1, the team, which was founded in 2002 by Mr. Samra and Mr. O’Keefe, managed two investment strategies—Global Value and Non-U.S. Value, with Mr. O’Keefe serving as lead portfolio manager of the Global Value strategy and Mr. Samra serving as lead portfolio manager of the Non-U.S. Value strategy.
From and after October 1, 2018, the current Global Value team has managed the Global Value strategy, with Mr. O’Keefe serving as lead portfolio manager and Justin V. Bandy and Michael J. McKinnon serving as co-portfolio managers.

Distribution, Investment Products and Client Relationships
The goal of our marketing, distribution and client service efforts is to grow and maintain a client base that is diversified by investment strategy, investment vehicle (for example, across mutual funds and separate accounts), distribution channel (for example, institutional, intermediary and retail) and geographic region. We focus our distribution and marketing efforts on institutions and on intermediaries that operate with institutional-like, centralized decision-making processes and longer-term investment horizons. We have designed our distribution strategies and structured our distribution teams to use knowledgeable, seasoned marketing and client service professionals in a way intended to limit the time our investment professionals are required to spend in marketing and client service activities. We believe that minimizing other demands allows our portfolio managers and other investment professionals to focus their energies and attention on the investment decision-making process, which we believe enhances the opportunity to achieve superior investment returns. Our distribution efforts are centrally managed by our Head of Global Distribution, who oversees and coordinates the efforts of our marketing and client service professionals. 
We continue to expand our distribution efforts into non-U.S. markets, with our primary non-U.S. efforts focused currently on the United Kingdom, other European countries, Australia, Canada and certain countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. In our non-U.S. distribution efforts, we use regional specialists who draw on the knowledge and expertise of our strategy-focused professionals. As of December 31, 2018, 21% of our total assets under management were sourced from clients located outside the United States.
Institutional Channel
Our institutional distribution channel includes institutional clients, such as U.S.-registered mutual funds, non-U.S. funds and collective investment trusts we sub-advise; state and local governments; employee benefit plans including Taft-Hartley plans; foundations; and endowments. Our institutional distribution channel also includes defined contribution/401(k) plans. We offer our investment products to institutional clients directly and by marketing our services to the investment consultants and advisors that advise them. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 45% of our assets under management were attributed to clients represented by investment consultants.
As of December 31, 2018, 66% of our assets under management were sourced through our institutional channel. 
Intermediary Channel
We maintain relationships with a number of major brokerage firms and larger private banks and trust companies at which the process for identifying which funds to offer has been centralized to a relatively limited number of key decision-makers that exhibit institutional decision-making behavior. We also maintain relationships with a number of financial advisory firms and broker-dealer advisors that offer our investment products to their clients. These advisors range from relatively small firms to large organizations. 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 29% of our assets under management were sourced through our intermediary channel.
Retail Channel
We primarily access retail investors indirectly through mutual fund supermarkets through which investors have the ability to purchase and redeem fund shares. U.S. investors can also invest directly in the series of Artisan Funds. Our subsidiary, Artisan Partners Distributors LLC, a registered broker-dealer, distributes shares of Artisan Funds. Publicity and ratings and rankings from Morningstar, Lipper and others are important in building the Artisan Partners brand, which is important in attracting retail investors. As a result, we publicize the ratings and rankings received by the series of Artisan Funds and work to ensure that potential retail investors have appropriate information to evaluate a potential investment in Artisan Funds. We do not generally use direct marketing campaigns as we believe that their cost outweighs their potential benefits. 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5% of our assets under management were sourced from investors we categorize as retail investors.
Access Through a Range of Investment Vehicles
Our clients access our investment strategies through a range of investment vehicles, including separate accounts and pooled vehicles. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 52% of our assets under management were in separate accounts, and Artisan Funds and Artisan Global Funds accounted for approximately 48% of our total assets under management.
Separate Accounts
We manage separate account assets within most of our investment strategies. As of December 31, 2018, we managed 211 separate accounts spanning 132 client relationships and our largest separate account relationship represented approximately 9% of our assets under management. Our separate account clients include both institutional and intermediary channel relationships. We generally require a minimum relationship of $20 million to $100 million, depending on the strategy, to manage a separate account. We also offer access to a number of our strategies through Artisan-branded collective investment trusts and through funds (both public and private) that we advise or sub-advise. The fees we charge our separate accounts vary by client, investment strategy and the size of the account. Fees are accrued monthly, but generally are paid quarterly in arrears. 
In our reporting materials, unless otherwise stated, our separate account AUM includes assets we manage in traditional separate accounts, as well as assets we manage in Artisan-branded collective investment trusts, in funds (both public and private) that we sub-advise, and in Artisan Private Funds.
Artisan Funds and Artisan Global Funds
U.S. investors that do not meet our minimum account size for a separate account, or who otherwise prefer to invest through a mutual fund, can invest in our strategies through Artisan Funds. We serve as the investment adviser to each series of Artisan Funds, SEC-registered mutual funds that offer no-load, no 12b-1 share classes designed to meet the needs of a range of investors. Each series of Artisan Funds corresponds to an investment strategy we offer to clients. We earn investment management fees, which are based on the average daily net assets of each Artisan Fund and are paid monthly, for serving as investment adviser to these funds. 
We also serve as investment manager of Artisan Global Funds, a family of Ireland-based UCITS funds. Artisan Global Funds, which began operations in 2011, provides non-U.S. investors with access to a number of our investment strategies. We earn investment management fees, which are based on the average daily net assets of each sub-fund and are generally paid monthly, for serving as investment adviser to these funds.
Regulatory Environment and Compliance
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level, as well as by self-regulatory organizations and regulators located outside the United States. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. A regulatory proceeding, regardless of whether it results in a sanction, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on our reputation or business.
U.S. Regulation
Artisan Partners Limited Partnership and Artisan Partners UK LLP are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and Artisan Funds and several of the investment companies we sub-advise are registered under the 1940 Act. The Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers and mutual funds. The Securities Act and the Exchange Act, along with the regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose additional restrictions and requirements on mutual funds. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of those Acts, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration. 
As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted that duty to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things: trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts; allocations of investment opportunities among clients; use of soft dollars; execution of transactions; and recommendations to clients. We manage accounts for our clients on a discretionary basis, with authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades, select counter-parties for principal transactions and negotiate counter-party compensation such as commissions and spreads. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of a change in law or regulation or client pressure, our operating expenses would increase, potentially materially. 
As a registered adviser, we are subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things, disclosure of information about our business to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive books and records; restrictions on the types of fees we may charge; custody of client assets; client privacy; advertising; and solicitation of clients. The SEC has authority to, and typically does, inspect a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) in a manner that is consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate controls, systems and procedures to ensure compliance.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, 61% of our revenues were derived from our advisory services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, including 59% from our advisory services to Artisan Funds. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and affairs of Artisan Funds and the investment portfolios of Artisan Funds and the funds we sub-advise, those operations are subject to oversight and management by each fund’s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors must not be “interested persons” (sometimes referred to as the “independent director” requirement). The responsibilities of each fund’s board include, among other things, approving our investment management agreement with the fund; approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. 
Our investment management agreements with these funds may be terminated by the funds on minimal notice, and are subject to annual renewal by each fund’s board after the initial term of one to two years. The 1940 Act also imposes on the investment adviser to a mutual fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the adviser’s investment management fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action or by litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action. 
As required by the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without client consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment management agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in us. 
Artisan Partners Distributors LLC, our SEC-registered broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule and the National Securities Clearing Corporation’s excess net capital requirement, which require that at least a minimum part of a registered broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. 
Artisan Partners Limited Partnership is a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions.
Non-U.S. Regulation
In addition to the extensive regulation we are subject to in the United States, a number of our subsidiaries and certain non-U.S. operations are subject to regulation in non-U.S. jurisdictions. One of our subsidiaries, Artisan Partners UK LLP, is authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which is responsible for the conduct of business and supervision of financial firms in the United Kingdom. The Central Bank of Ireland imposes requirements on UCITS funds subject to regulation by it, including Artisan Global Funds, as do the regulators in certain other markets in which shares of Artisan Global Funds are offered for sale, and with which we are required to comply. We are also subject to regulation internationally by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, where we operate pursuant to orders of exemption, and by various Canadian regulatory authorities in the Canadian provinces where we operate pursuant to exemptions from registration. Our business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the countries in which we market our funds or services and conduct investment management activities, including the countries in which our investment strategies make investments. 
We are currently in the process of establishing a subsidiary in Ireland, which we expect will carry out distribution efforts in the European Union following Brexit and which will be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. 
We may become subject to additional regulatory demands in the future to the extent we expand our business in existing and new jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Industry—We are subject to extensive regulation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Industry—The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change, and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business.”
Competition
In order to grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Historically, we have competed to attract clients and investors principally on the basis of:

• | the performance of our investment strategies;


• | continuity of our investment professionals;


• | the quality of the service we provide to our clients; and


• | our brand recognition and reputation within the investing community.

We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “Risks Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry—The investment management industry is intensely competitive.”
Operations, Systems and Technology 
With respect to our equity strategies, we perform most middle- and back-office functions internally, generally using third-party software and technology for functions such as trade confirmation, trade settlement, custodian reconciliations, corporate action processing, performance calculation and client reporting, customized as necessary to support our investment processes and operations. With respect to our fixed income strategies, we outsource most of the middle- and back-office functions to service providers that we supervise. We have back-up and disaster recovery systems in place.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 425 full-time and part-time employees. 
Our Structure and Reorganization
Holding Company Structure
We are a holding company and our assets principally consist of our ownership of partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings, deferred tax assets and cash. As the sole general partner of Artisan Partners Holdings, we operate and control all of its business and affairs, subject to certain voting rights of its limited partners. We conduct all of our business activities through operating subsidiaries of Artisan Partners Holdings. Net profits and net losses are allocated based on the ownership of partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 70% of Artisan Partners Holdings, and the other 30% was owned by the limited partners of Artisan Partners Holdings.
IPO Reorganization
In March 2013, we completed our IPO. In connection with the IPO, we and Artisan Partners Holdings completed a series of reorganization transactions, which we refer to as the IPO Reorganization, in order to reorganize our capital structures in preparation for the IPO. The IPO Reorganization included, among other changes, the following:

• | Our appointment as the sole general partner of Artisan Partners Holdings.


• | The modification of our capital structure into three classes of common stock and a series of convertible preferred stock. We issued shares of our Class B common stock, Class C common stock and convertible preferred stock to pre-IPO partners of Artisan Partners Holdings. Each share of Class B common stock corresponds to a Class B common unit of Artisan Partners Holdings. Each share of Class C common stock corresponds to either a Class A, Class D or Class E common unit of Artisan Partners Holdings. Subject to certain restrictions, each common unit of Artisan Partners Holdings (together with the corresponding share of Class B or Class C common stock) is exchangeable for a share of our Class A common stock.


• | A corporation (“H&F Corp”) merged with and into Artisan Partners Asset Management, which we refer to in this document as the H&F Corp Merger. As consideration for the merger, the shareholder of H&F Corp received shares of our convertible preferred stock, contingent value rights, or CVRs, issued by Artisan Partners Asset Management and the right to receive an amount of cash. In November 2013, the CVRs issued by Artisan Partners Asset Management were terminated with no amounts paid or payable thereunder. In June 2014, the shareholder of H&F Corp converted all of its then-remaining shares of convertible preferred stock into shares of Class A common stock and sold those shares. We no longer have any outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, and Artisan Partners Holdings no longer has any outstanding preferred units.


• | The voting and certain other rights of each class of limited partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings were modified. In addition, Artisan Partners Holdings separately issued CVRs to the holders of the preferred units. In November 2013, the CVRs issued by Artisan Partners Holdings were terminated with no amounts paid or payable thereunder.


• | We entered into two tax receivable agreements (“TRAs”), one with a private equity fund (the “Pre-H&F Corp Merger Shareholder”) and the other with each limited partner of Artisan Partners Holdings. Pursuant to the first TRA, APAM pays to the Pre-H&F Corp Merger Shareholder (or its assignees) a portion of certain tax benefits APAM realizes as a result of the H&F Corp Merger. Pursuant to the second TRA, APAM pays to current or former limited partners of Artisan Partners Holdings (or their assignees) a portion of certain tax benefits APAM realizes as a result of the purchase or exchange of their limited partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings.

The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2018:

(1) | Our employees to whom we have granted equity have entered into a stockholders agreement with respect to all shares of our common stock they have acquired from us and any shares they may acquire from us in the future, pursuant to which they granted an irrevocable voting proxy to a stockholders committee currently consisting of Eric R. Colson (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), Charles J. Daley, Jr. (Chief Financial Officer) and Gregory K. Ramirez (Executive Vice President). The stockholders committee, by vote of a majority of its members, will determine the vote of all of the shares subject to the stockholders agreement. In addition to owning all of the shares of our Class B common stock, our employee-partners, together with our other employees, owned unvested restricted shares of our Class A common stock representing approximately 8% of our outstanding Class A common stock as of December 31, 2018.
(2) | Each class of common units generally entitles its holders to the same economic and voting rights in Artisan Partners Holdings as each other class of common units, except that the Class E common units have no voting rights except as required by law.
