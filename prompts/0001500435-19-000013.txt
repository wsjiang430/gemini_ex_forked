Item 1. Business
Overview
GoPro helps its consumers capture and share their experiences in immersive and exciting ways. Our cameras, and mountable and wearable accessories have generated substantially all of our revenue and are sold globally through retailers, wholesale distributors and on our website. 
Our product offerings include the following:

• | HERO7 is our cloud-connected line of durable, waterproof cameras launched in the Fall of 2018, featuring image stabilization, telemetry, cloud connectivity and voice control. Our HERO7 Black camera features HyperSmooth image stabilization, which makes it easy to capture professional-looking gimbal-like stabilized videos without a gimbal, TimeWarp Video, which applies a high-speed, ‘magic-carpet-ride’ effect to videos, live streaming, which enables users to share content in real time to Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, Vimeo and other platforms internationally, and improved audio. Our HERO7 Black camera is powered by GoPro’s custom-designed GP1 processor and is the most powerful and performance featured GoPro camera to date. We also began shipping our HERO7 Silver and HERO7 White cameras in 2018, which feature advanced stabilization, cloud connectivity, voice control and a touch display. We offer many professional-grade features with our current good-better-best camera offering with HERO7 White, HERO7 Silver and HERO7 Black cameras. Our cameras are compatible with our ecosystem of mountable and wearable accessories, and feature automatic uploading capabilities for photos and videos to GoPro Plus, our premium cloud-based storage solution.


• | Fusion is our 360-degree waterproof spherical camera which can shoot in 5.2K at 30 frames per second and features time lapse modes. Additionally, our latest firmware update enabled Fusion to also shoot in 5.8K at 24 frames per second for film and television production professionals. Using our GoPro App, a mobile user can preview live shots, stitch, trim and share content directly from their mobile device. The GoPro App’s OverCapture feature allows the user to re-frame and save traditional fixed-perspective videos “punched out” or extracted from a 360-degree video source file.


• | GoPro Plus is our premium cloud-based storage solution that enables subscribers to easily access, edit and share content. GoPro Plus includes unlimited cloud storage supporting source video and photo quality. The subscription service also includes discounts on accessories and in the United States, camera replacement and damage protection. All of our HERO5 and newer cameras can automatically upload new photos and videos to a subscriber’s GoPro Plus account at the highest possible quality.

• | Quik is our primary mobile editing app that makes it simple to create stunning edits on a smartphone. Our Quik desktop app provides expanded editing options for power users.


• | GoPro App is a mobile app that allows users to preview and play back photos and videos, control their GoPro cameras and share content on the fly using their smartphones. Included in the GoPro App is GoPro QuikStories, a mobile experience that seamlessly copies a user’s GoPro photos and video clips to his or her smartphone and transforms them into a ready-to-share video. GoPro QuikStories makes it simple to automatically create shareable video edits complete with music, effects and transitions.


• | Karma Grip is a handheld or body-mountable camera stabilizer that makes it easy to capture zero-shake, smooth video.

We also offer a full ecosystem of mountable and wearable accessories. See Products for additional information. 
We believe our investments in hardware, cloud and mobile solutions have yielded a solid foundational experience for consumers that we will continue to build upon in 2019. 
Our strategy
Helping our consumers capture and share their experiences in immersive and exciting ways is at the core of our business. We are committed to developing solutions that create an easy, seamless experience for consumers to capture, create and share engaging personal content. When consumers use our products and services, they often generate and share content that organically increases awareness for GoPro, driving a virtuous cycle and a self-reinforcing demand for our products. We believe revenue growth will be driven by the introduction of new cameras, accessories, software applications, subscription offerings and value-driven pricing. We believe new camera features drive a replacement cycle among existing users and attract new users, expanding our total addressable market. Key components of our 2019 strategy and beyond include the following: 
Increase profitability through improved efficiency, lower costs and better execution. We plan to continue to operate at a similar expense level in 2019 from 2018, while investing in awareness, demand generation and our future roadmap. We incurred material operating losses in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our operating expenses effectively. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we implemented company-wide restructurings of our business resulting in reductions-in-force, the elimination of several high-cost initiatives (including the closure of our entertainment group and our exit from the aerial market) and the consolidation of certain leased office facilities around the globe, in order to improve efficiencies and focus our resources on our hardware and software integrated storytelling solutions. (See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding restructuring charges in 2018, 2017 and 2016.) The actions taken reduced our 2018 operating expenses by $92.6 million from 2017 and reduced our 2017 operating expenses by $286.9 million from 2016.
Attract, engage and retain top talent. In every area of our company, we want to retain employees committed to growing GoPro through great ideas and innovation. We plan to do this by leveraging our strong brand recognition, unique culture, competitive compensation and benefits as well as our strong commitment to our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging initiative. GoPro’s culture has been central to our ability to attract top talent. We hope to maintain this with events and programs that engage our people such as our Live It initiative that encourages employees to dedicate time each week to use GoPro products to gain an authentic understanding of the GoPro user experience. The hallmark of the GoPro employment brand is a closely-knit community, referred to as the GoPro Family, who work collaboratively in a lively workplace and are supported by competitive compensation and benefits, growth opportunities and engaging programs to boost professional development. 
Focus on our ecosystem to eliminate friction from the customer experience. We believe eliminating the pain points involved in managing content and producing and sharing immersive experiences delivers on the promise of the GoPro experience for our target customers. Our cloud-connected HERO7, HERO6 and HERO5 cameras, GoPro Plus service, and apps work together to enable an ecosystem that allows users to capture, edit and share those experiences on a mobile device and easily back-up the content in the cloud. We believe the auto-upload and voice control features of these cameras provide game-changing experiences for consumers that we intend to continue to build upon with our next-generation cameras. Our Quik editing app and GoPro App enable users to quickly produce high-quality videos that are fun to create and easy to share across multiple platforms. We are focused on enhancing our software and services offerings, including simplified solutions that 
5

automate editing on-the-go, provide flexibility and creativity, and improve and simplify content transfer from GoPro cameras to mobile devices. We remain focused on making the smartphone a key component in the GoPro user experience.
Expand the value and awareness of our Plus subscription offerings.  Since its launch in 2016, our subscription service, GoPro Plus, has steadily grown to more than 200,000 paying subscribers. GoPro Plus includes unlimited storage of original quality videos and photos, discounts on mounts and accessories, and in the United States, includes camera replacement and damage protection. We plan to continue growing our Plus business in 2019 by providing additional value and differentiated offerings, while refining and increasing our marketing efforts to drive awareness and more deeply engage our large consumer base.
Launch products that better serve our target customer segments. We believe that once consumers enter GoPro’s product ecosystem, many become repeat purchasers, upgrading to our newest products with enhanced features or purchasing other products at compelling price points. In an effort to continue inspiring upgraders and attract new consumers into our ecosystem, we plan to design and market innovative, easy-to-use products and services that will appeal directly to our target audience of active people who are passionate about capturing their experiences.
Refine marketing to grow our brand and target-customer relevance globally. In 2018, we increased GoPro’s marketing investment to drive a consistent, annual cadence of awareness and better capitalize on the launch of new products and services. With a deeper understanding of our target segments, we plan to continue to broaden the awareness of our solutions and drive an understanding of product innovations to increase new user adoption and inspire upgrades. We believe that international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity for GoPro. We will continue to increase our global presence through the active promotion of our brand, the creation and cultivation of regional strategic and marketing partnerships, the expansion of localized products in international markets with region specific marketing, and an investment focus on the biggest opportunities. 
Optimize analytics and customer understanding to enable better business planning. Our increased commitment to and investment in customer research and analytics was fundamental to our strategy in 2018, allowing us to better manage and improve the predictability of our business, and design better products and services that provide the best value and solutions for our customers. We plan to further leverage analytics and integrate a deeper understanding of our target customers across the business to optimize the next generation of our products and go-to-market strategies.
In addition to the key components of our 2019 strategy and beyond, we will seek to leverage our brand strength and product expertise to drive a hardware upgrade cycle for our users, opportunistically enter complementary new device categories and continue to develop spherical-capture/virtual reality products. With our robust ecosystem of mounts and accessories, GoPro products allow our users to live the moment they wish to capture without having to step outside of that moment to capture it.
Products 
Cameras. We offer a good-better-best camera line-up that includes our cloud connected HERO7 White, HERO7 Silver and HERO7 Black cameras. We also offer Fusion, our 360-degree spherical camera. HERO7 White, HERO7 Silver, HERO7 Black and Fusion cameras are durable, waterproof (without a housing), come with select mounting accessories, and have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth providing connectivity with a mobile device to enable remote control, content viewing, editing and sharing functionality. Our HERO7 Black and HERO7 Silver cameras can shoot video in 4K at 60 and 30 frames per second, respectively, and Fusion shoots video in 5.2K at 30 frames per second in 360-degrees. Our latest firmware update also enabled Fusion to shoot in 5.8K at 24 frames per second for film and television production professionals. All of our current cameras feature multi-language voice and contextual control, electronic image stabilization, simplified user experience, and the ability to auto-upload photos and videos to GoPro Plus via Wi-Fi for easy access and editing with our apps. HERO7 Black, HERO7 Silver and Fusion also feature GPS and additional sensors that capture location, elevation, speed and G-force loads.
Mounts and accessories.  We offer a wide range of mounts and accessories, either bundled with a camera or sold separately, that enhance the functionality and versatility of our products, and enable our consumers to 
6

capture their experiences during a variety of activities or moments from different viewpoints. Our equipment-based mounts include helmet, handlebar, roll bar and tripod mounts. Our 3-way mount is a 3-in-1 mount that can be used as a camera grip, extension arm or tripod, and our floating mounts such as the Handler, and Bite Mount + Floaty, allow our cameras to float in water. We also enable consumers to wear mounts on their bodies with the use of our wrist housing, chest harness and head strap. Additionally, we offer colored camera sleeves, spare batteries, dive filters and charging accessories and cables to connect our GoPro cameras to computers, laptops and television monitors. Our accessories expand the features, versatility and convenience of our cameras. 
Applications.  We offer mobile and desktop applications to all consumers at no charge that help our users manage, edit, view and share their content. Our GoPro App allows users to control their GoPro in addition to downloading, playback, and sharing their content on the fly using their smartphones. Additionally, by using our Fusion camera together with our GoPro App’s OverCapture feature, users can re-frame and save traditional fixed-perspective videos “punched out” or extracted from a 360-degree video source file. From the Quik mobile app, users can automatically create and share QuikStories from their smartphone or GoPro content. With QuikStories, content transforms into a seamless video automatically, utilizing machine learning and computer vision to pick and frame the footage. Quik for desktop automatically imports content from a GoPro camera and makes it simple for users to create awe-inspiring videos synced to music with just a few clicks of the mouse. 
Services. GoPro Plus is a cloud-based subscription service that offers a range of premium benefits to our consumers, including damage protection and camera replacement in the United States, easy auto-upload from a GoPro camera to the cloud for on-the-go access, storage of unlimited photos and videos, editing and sharing using a smartphone and the Quik app, an expanded library of soundtracks, premium support, and exclusive discounts on mounts and accessories. We had more than 185,000 paying subscribers as of December 31, 2018, which has subsequently increased to more than 200,000 paying subscribers as of February 12, 2019. GoPro Care is a fee-based service that offers a range of support options to our customers, including extended warranty and accidental damage coverage. Revenue earned to date from GoPro Plus and GoPro Care was not material to our results.
Image stabilization. The Karma Grip, which we offer as a standalone accessory, is a handheld, body-mountable 3-axis camera stabilizer that makes it easy to capture zero-shake, smooth video.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced our highest levels of revenue in the fourth quarter of the year, coinciding with the holiday shopping season, particularly in the United States and Europe. While we have implemented operational changes aimed at reducing the impact of fourth quarter seasonality on full year performance, timely and effective product introductions and forecasting, whether just prior to the holiday season or otherwise, are critical to our operations and financial performance. 
Segment information and geographic data
We operate as one reportable segment. Financial information about geographic areas is presented in Note 12 Concentrations of risk and geographic information, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Backlog
We do not believe that backlog information is material or meaningful as of any particular date or indicative of future sales, as our customers can change or cancel orders with limited or no penalty and limited advance notice prior to shipment.
Research and development
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products that inspire our consumers and enhance our brand. We are constantly innovating to deliver better performance, expanded functionality and increased convenience to enhance the appeal of our products. We strive to remain a market leader by consistently introducing innovative products, software and services that offer optimal performance at affordable price points.

We have a user experience-driven approach to product development and our CEO leads product design. By engaging with customers, consumers and opinion leaders in our core markets around the world, our development team strives to introduce meaningful and empowering new features that expand the versatility and performance of our products. We also benefit from input received from our in-house production team, our sponsored athletes and our brand advocates that regularly travel the world capturing content using our products. We believe leveraging this input will help refine our existing products and influence future products that give us a competitive advantage.
Our engineering team supports the development of cameras, related mounts and accessories, firmware and software. Our hardware engineering team is responsible for developing technologies to support the concepts developed by our product team. These core technologies include GoPro’s custom designed GP1 processor, which allows cameras to perform advanced image computation and provides unparalleled image quality and next-level image stabilization, new image silicon processors, image sensors and lenses, as well as the core algorithms that enable the systems to operate and provide optimal performance and features. Our hardware engineering team also integrates these innovations and firmware into our product designs and develops our cameras, mounts and accessories. 
Our software engineering team develops applications that enhance the functionality of our products and facilitate the management, editing, sharing and viewing of content. These applications are being developed for mobile, desktop and web-based platforms. Our core technologies include rendering engines to enable smooth video playback and editing, algorithms for moment identification, automatic story creation as well as cloud-based media storage, analysis and playback.
Manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment
Our products are designed and developed in the United States, France, China and Romania, and a significant majority of our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers located in China, Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In 2019, we plan to move most of our United States bound camera production from China to Mexico, including final pack-out of some of our finished products, a change catalyzed by tariff-related concerns. We expect the relocation will be cost neutral as we own our production equipment and relocating may provide potential efficiencies in our supply chain. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. Several key strategic parts are purchased from suppliers by us and then consigned to our manufacturers, while the vast majority of parts are procured directly by our contract manufacturers. Our strategic commodities team manages the pricing and supply of the key components of our cameras, including digital signal processors, sensors and lenses, and we leverage their expertise to achieve competitive pricing on the largest value-add components and leverage our contract manufacturers’ volume purchases for best pricing on common parts.
We have third-party facilities in Southern China for final pack-out of our finished products. Finished products are consolidated in Hong Kong and then shipped to fulfillment centers in California, Kentucky, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore that deliver our products to our customers. Cameras are typically air freighted while accessories are shipped via ocean freighter from our consolidation facility in Hong Kong to our fulfillment centers. Our fulfillment strategy allows us to reduce shipping costs, reduce custom levies and improve inventory flexibility.
Sales channels and customers 
We offer our products in over 30,000 retail outlets and in over 100 countries through our direct sales channel and indirectly through our distribution channel. In 2018 and 2017, our direct sales accounted for 48% and 54% of our revenue, respectively, and our distributors accounted for 52% and 46% of our revenue, respectively.
Direct sales
We sell directly to most of our retailers in the United States, some of our retailers in Europe and to consumers worldwide through our e-commerce channels. 
8

Independent specialty retailers. We use a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products to independent specialty retailers in the United States focused on sports and consumer activity capture markets. Our representatives provide highly personalized service to these retailers, including in-store merchandising, taking orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about GoPro products and services. We also have an internal, regionally focused sales team that provides a secondary level of service to both the independent specialty retailers and manufacturer representatives. Independent specialty retailers generally carry our higher end products, targeting their core customers who we believe tend to be early adopters of new technologies. Independent specialty retailers outside of the United States represent a similarly important sales channel for us, and we reach these customers indirectly through our network of international distributors.
Big box retailers. We sell to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Inc., Target Corporation, Wal-Mart, Inc., Dixons Carphone and Fnac. We support these retailers with a dedicated and experienced sales management team that we believe enables us to reduce channel conflict.
Mid-market retailers.  We also sell to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing, and motorsports. In the United States, we sell directly to these mid-market retailers through our experienced sales teams assigned to particular accounts and regions. 
E-commerce channel.  We sell our full line of products to consumers worldwide through our online store at gopro.com, which we market through online and offline advertising. Sales through gopro.com were less than 10% of our total revenue for 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Distribution
We sell to over 55 distributors who resell our products to retailers in international and domestic markets. We have dedicated sales personnel focused on providing a high level of service to these distributors, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, development of marketing materials, order assistance and educating the distributors’ sales personnel about GoPro products. 
In-store merchandising 
Our in-store merchandising strategy focuses on our iconic GoPro-branded, video-enabled point of purchase (POP) merchandising displays that are located in nearly all retail outlets where our products are sold. These displays showcase GoPro videos and present our product ecosystem in a customer-friendly manner. Our larger retailers help us represent a broader range of GoPro products due to their in-store deployment of our larger and custom POP displays. We have been successful working with our retailers to further expand the footprint of our POP displays within existing stores. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately 29,000 POP displays in retail outlets worldwide.
Marketing and advertising 
Our marketing and advertising programs are focused on engaging consumers by exposing them to compelling GoPro content and educating them about new hardware features as well as the power of our solutions for software editing (mobile and desktop applications) and content management (GoPro Plus). We believe this approach enhances our brand while demonstrating the performance, durability and versatility of our products. Our marketing and advertising efforts span a wide range of consumer interests and leverage both traditional consumer marketing and lifestyle marketing strategies. 
9

Consumer marketing.  Social media plays an important role in our consumer marketing strategy. Our consumers capture and share personal GoPro content on social media and content sharing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Vimeo and YouTube. In 2018, we gained 3.3 million new followers to our social accounts for a lifetime total of 38.4 million followers. Of the 3.3 million new followers on our social accounts, 1.9 million were on Instagram, resulting in a lifetime total of 16.7 million on Instagram. To date, we have reached 2.3 billion views on YouTube. Additionally, our latest GoPro HERO7 launch video ranked in the top 10 Google ad leaderboard in September 2018. We also integrate user-generated content and GoPro originally produced content into advertising campaigns across various platforms including print, online, billboards and other out of home advertising, and at consumer and trade facing events. This content also supports our in-store channel marketing efforts, appearing on our POP displays and other in-store marketing materials. We continue to believe GoPro content remains a significant asset that builds awareness for our brand and products. 
Lifestyle marketing. Our lifestyle marketing programs focus on expanding GoPro brand awareness by engaging consumers through relationships with key influencers, event promotions and other outreach efforts. We cultivate strong relationships with influential athletes, celebrities, entertainers and brands, all of whom use our products to create and share engaging content with their own fans and consumers.
Competition
The market for cameras is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include quality, reliability and user experience, price and performance, design innovation, brand recognition, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and brand reputation.
We compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc. and Nikon Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as, Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corporation and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd., the Ricoh Company, Ltd. and Shenzhen Arashi Vision Co., Ltd. We believe we compete favorably with these companies’ products. Our durable and versatile product design facilitates increased functionality and wearability and we offer a variety of mounts and other accessories that enable a wide range of consumer use cases that are difficult for other competing products to address. Further, we offer many professional-grade features within our camera and spherical product offerings at attractive consumer price points, including our SuperView mode, which allows a user to capture an immersive wide-angle perspective, super high-resolution video capability, voice control features, image stabilization, and for our 360 experience, OverCapture, which allows a Fusion user to capture content from every angle. We also provide users with a suite of free mobile and desktop applications that enhance the overall GoPro experience. Moreover, we believe we have achieved significant brand recognition in our target vertical markets. We believe our years of experience working with active and influential consumers contributes to our ability to develop attractive products and establishes the authenticity of our brand, thereby differentiating us from current and potential competitors. 
Smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional camera sales, and the makers of those devices also have mobile and other content editing applications and storage for content captured with those devices. Our Quik mobile and desktop editing applications, our GoPro App and our GoPro Plus service may not be as compelling a solution as those offered by other companies, such as Apple, Inc. and Google, although the Quik mobile application supports content from other platforms including content from iOS and Android. Also, it is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of such devices, such as Apple, Google and Samsung, may continue to design their products for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments and waterproof capabilities, or develop products with features similar to ours. In addition, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products directly in our category.

Intellectual property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and our practice is to seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. Our trademarks, including “GOPRO,” “HERO,” “SESSION” and the GoPro logos, among others, are a critical component of the value of our business. In addition, we hold many issued and pending utility and design patents for innovations that help our consumers capture, create and share their content using our cameras, drones, mounts, accessories and software. Our patents cover areas that include physical structures, image processing, operational firmware and software, post-processing software, distribution software, mount and accessory structures, as well as the ornamental aspects of our hardware and software products. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 510 issued patents and 436 patent applications pending in the United States, and 283 corresponding issued patents and 108 patent applications pending in foreign countries. Our issued United States patents will expire approximately between 2024 and 2036 and our issued foreign patents will expire approximately between 2022 and 2042. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. We continually review our development efforts to assess our innovations, including their patentability. We take active measures to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party use, including misuse of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights.
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections in agreements with employees, contract manufacturers, distributors and others. Despite these protections, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any nondisclosure agreements with us, or independently developing products that are similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 891 employees. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages.
Corporate and available information
