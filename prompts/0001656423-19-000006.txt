Item 1. Business
General
BXP, a Delaware corporation organized in 1997, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or “REIT,” and one of the largest developers, owners and managers of office properties in the United States.
Our properties are concentrated in five markets—Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. At December 31, 2018, we owned or had interests in 197 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 51.6 million net rentable square feet of primarily Class A office properties, including 11 properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2018 our properties consisted of:

• | 178 office properties (including nine properties under construction/redevelopment);


• | twelve retail properties;


• | six residential properties (including two under construction); and


• | one hotel.

We consider Class A office properties to be well-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. Our definition of Class A office properties may be different than those used by other companies.
We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services. BXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 760 employees. Our 37 senior officers have an average of 31 years of experience in the real estate industry, including an average of 21 years of experience with us. Our principal executive office and Boston regional office are located at Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 2400 Broadway, Suite 510, Santa Monica, California 90404, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111 and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20037.

You may also obtain BXP’s and BPLP’s reports by accessing the EDGAR database at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov, or we will furnish an electronic or paper copy of these reports free of charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, Boston Properties, Inc., Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199. “Boston Properties” is a registered trademark and the “bxp” logo is a trademark, in both cases, of BPLP.
Boston Properties Limited Partnership
BPLP is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1997, and the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP and, as of February 22, 2019, the owner of approximately 89.5% of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP, (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP Units, other than LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards (“MYLTIP Awards”) that remain subject to performance conditions, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, (3) the 2012 Outperformance Awards that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 6, 2015 (the “2012 OPP Units”), (4) the 2013 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 4, 2016 (the “2013 MYLTIP Units”), (5) the 2014 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 3, 2017 (the “2014 MYLTIP Units”), (6) 
1 

the 2015 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 4, 2018 (the “2015 MYLTIP Units”) and (7) the 2016 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 9, 2019 (the “2016 MYLTIP Units”). An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP’s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. BXP’s general and limited partnership interests in BPLP entitles BXP to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, BPLP in proportion to BXP’s percentage interest and entitles BXP to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. 
Preferred units of BPLP have the rights, preferences and other privileges set forth in an amendment to the limited partnership agreement of BPLP. As of December 31, 2018 and February 22, 2019, BPLP had one series of Preferred Units outstanding consisting of 80,000 Series B Preferred Units. The Series B Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $2,500 per share (or an aggregate of approximately $193.6 million at December 31, 2018 and February 22, 2019, after deducting the underwriting discount and transaction expenses). The Series B Preferred Units were issued by BPLP on March 27, 2013 in connection with BXP’s issuance of 80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares each representing 1/100th of a share) of 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). BXP contributed the net proceeds from the offering to BPLP in exchange for Series B Preferred Units having rights, performance and privileges generally mirroring those of the Series B Preferred Stock. BXP will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a rate of 5.25% per annum of the $2,500 liquidation preference per share. BXP did not have the right to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock prior to March 27, 2018, except in certain circumstances relating to the preservation of BXP’s REIT status. On and after March 27, 2018, BXP, at its option, may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock for a cash redemption price of $2,500 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the holders, has no maturity date and is not convertible into any other security of the Company or its affiliates.

2 

value of the property exceeded its estimated fair value prior to the sale, and as a result, we recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $8.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018. 6595 Springfield Center Drive is an approximately 634,000 net rentable square foot Class A office project.
On December 20, 2018, we completed the sale of a 41-acre parcel of land at our Tower Oaks property located in Rockville, Maryland for a gross sale price of approximately $46.0 million.

We agreed to provide seller financing to the buyer totaling $21.0 million, which is collateralized by a portion of the land parcel that secures the loan, bears interest at an effective rate of 1.92% per annum and matures on December 20, 2021. The loan has been reflected as Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Impairment Loss
For information explaining why BXP and BPLP may report different impairment losses, see the Explanatory Note that follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we reevaluated our strategy for the sale of our 2600 Tower Oaks Boulevard property. Based on a shorter than expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value at December 31, 2018 and recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $3.1 million for BXP and approximately $1.5 million for BPLP. Our estimated fair value was based on a pending offer for the sale of the property. 2600 Tower Oaks Boulevard is an approximately 179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Developments/Redevelopments
As of December 31, 2018, we had 11 properties under construction/redevelopment comprised of nine office properties and two residential properties, which we expect will total approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet. We estimate the total investment to complete these projects, in the aggregate, is approximately $2.7 billion of which we had already invested approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. For a detailed list of the properties under construction/redevelopment see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
On January 24, 2018, we entered into a lease agreement with an affiliate of Leidos Holdings, Inc. for a build-to-suit project with approximately 276,000 net rentable square feet of Class A office space at our 17Fifty Presidents Street development project located in Reston, Virginia. Concurrently with the execution of the lease, we commenced development of the project and expect the building to be completed and available for occupancy during the second quarter of 2020. 
On February 23, 2018, we entered into a lease agreement with Fannie Mae to lease approximately 850,000 net rentable square feet of Class A office space at our Reston Gateway development project located in Reston, Virginia. The initial phase of the project will consist of two Class A office buildings aggregating approximately 1.1 million net rentable square feet. On August 31, 2018, we commenced development of the project. 
On June 7, 2018, we completed and fully placed in-service our Signature at Reston development project comprised of 508 apartment units and retail space aggregating approximately 518,000 square feet located in Reston, Virginia. This project was partially placed in-service on January 31, 2018.
On August 7, 2018, we entered into an agreement with a third party to (1) share certain pre-development costs during the pre-lease period and (2) to form a joint venture to thereafter own and develop a leasehold interest in 343 Madison Avenue located in New York City, which will support a Class A office tower with approximately 850,000 net rentable square feet. We will serve as development manager of the project and will own a 55% interest in the joint venture. In 2016, we were selected by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ("MTA") as the developer of the project and will enter into a pre-lease agreement and a 99-year ground lease with the MTA for the site. There can be no assurances that the transaction will be completed on the terms currently contemplated, or at all.
On September 1, 2018, we completed and fully placed in-service our Proto Kendall Square development project comprised of 280 apartment units and retail space aggregating approximately 167,000 square feet located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This project was partially placed in-service on June 20, 2018.

On November 9, 2018, we completed and fully placed in-service 191 Spring Street, a Class A office redevelopment project with approximately 171,000 square feet located in Lexington, Massachusetts. This property is 100% leased.
On December 1, 2018, a consolidated entity in which we have a 95% interest completed and fully placed in-service Salesforce Tower, a Class A office project with approximately 1,421,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (See Notes 10 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Including leases with future commencement dates, this property is 100% leased. 
Ground Lease Arrangement
On November 29, 2018, we executed a 65-year ground lease for land totaling approximately 5.6 acres at Platform 16 located in San Jose, California, which will support approximately 1.1 million square feet of commercial office space. The ground lease provides us with the right to purchase the land during a 12-month period commencing in the 13th month following the rent commencement date at a purchase price of approximately $134.8 million. We made a deposit totaling $15.0 million, which deposit may only be credited against the purchase price of the land. Our option to purchase the land is considered a bargain purchase option and as a result, we have concluded that the lease should be accounted for as a capital lease. At the inception of the ground lease only a portion of the land was available for lease from the lessor (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result, we recorded an approximately $12.4 million capital lease asset and liability, which is reflected within Real Estate (Land Held for Future Development) and Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting the portion of the land available for lease from the lessor under the ground lease. Capital lease assets and liabilities are accounted for at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future minimum lease payments. The capital lease is for land only. Therefore, we will not depreciate the capital lease asset because land is assumed to have an indefinite life. 
Unsecured Debt Transactions
On April 24, 2018, BPLP exercised its option to draw $500.0 million on its delayed draw term loan facility ("Delayed Draw Facility"). The Delayed Draw Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.90% per annum based on BPLP's December 31, 2018 credit rating and matures on April 24, 2022.
On November 28, 2018, BPLP completed a public offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 4.500% unsecured senior notes due 2028. The notes were priced at 99.641% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 4.628% per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on December 1, 2028, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $988.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.
On December 13, 2018, BPLP completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% senior notes due October 15, 2019. The redemption price was approximately $722.6 million. The redemption price included approximately $6.6 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 102.28% of the principal amount being redeemed. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $16.5 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $16.0 million.
Equity Transaction
During the year ended December 31, 2018, BXP acquired an aggregate of 83,136 common units of limited partnership interest, including 48,389 common units issued upon the conversion of LTIP Units, 2012 OPP Units, 2013 MYLTIP Units and 2014 MYLTIP Units presented by the holders for redemption, in exchange for an equal number of shares of BXP common stock.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
On April 19, 2018, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest obtained construction financing with a total commitment of $180.0 million collateralized by its Hub on Causeway - Residential development project.  The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum and matures on April 19, 2022, with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $40.5 million has been drawn under the loan.  The Hub on Causeway - Residential is an approximately 320,000 square foot project comprised of 440 residential units located in Boston, Massachusetts.

On April 27, 2018, a joint venture in which we have a 60% interest refinanced the mortgage loan collateralized by its 540 Madison Avenue property located in New York City totaling $120.0 million.  The mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.10% per annum and matures on June 5, 2023.  The previous mortgage loan bore interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum and was scheduled to mature on June 5, 2018.  540 Madison Avenue is an approximately 284,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property. 
On July 13, 2018, we entered into a joint venture with a third party to acquire a development site at 3 Hudson Boulevard that, upon the future acquisition of additional available development rights, can accommodate a Class A office tower with up to 2.0 million net rentable square feet located on the entire square block between 11th Avenue and Hudson Boulevard Park from West 34th Street to West 35th Street in New York City.  We own a 25% interest in, and are the managing member of the joint venture.  The acquisition includes improvements consisting of excavation work and foundation elements that are currently being constructed on the site. We contributed cash totaling approximately $45.6 million at closing and will contribute approximately $62.2 million in the future for our initial capital contribution, a portion of which will fund the remaining costs to complete the foundation elements to grade for the future office building.  In addition, we provided $80.0 million of mortgage financing to the joint venture that bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum and matures on July 13, 2023, with extension options, subject to certain conditions. The loan has been reflected as a Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
On July 19, 2018, we entered into a joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB") to acquire Santa Monica Business Park in the Ocean Park neighborhood of Santa Monica, California for a net purchase price of approximately $626.7 million, including $11.5 million of seller funded leasing costs after the effective date of the purchase and sale agreement. Santa Monica Business Park is a 47-acre office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet. Approximately 70% of the rentable square footage is subject to a ground lease with 80 years remaining, including renewal periods. The ground lease provides the joint venture with the right to purchase the land underlying the properties in 2028 with subsequent purchase rights every 15 years. CPPIB invested approximately $147.0 million for a 45% ownership interest in the joint venture. We are providing customary operating, property management and leasing services to, and invested approximately $179.7 million, in the joint venture. The acquisition was completed with $300.0 million of financing. The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.28% per annum and matures on July 19, 2025. At closing, the borrower under the loan, which is a subsidiary of the joint venture, entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $300.0 million through April 1, 2025, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.063% per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
On July 27, 2018, we entered into a joint venture with our partner at The Hub on Causeway mixed-use development in Boston, Massachusetts to acquire the air rights for the development of an approximately 627,000 net rentable square foot Class A office tower at the site to be known as 100 Causeway Street. In addition, the joint venture entered into a lease agreement with an affiliate of Verizon Communications, Inc., under which Verizon will lease approximately 70% of the office tower for a term of 20 years.

We contributed improvements totaling approximately $3.9 million and will contribute cash totaling approximately $37.4 million for our initial 50% interest. 
On November 16, 2018, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest extended the loan collateralized by its Annapolis Junction Building Six property. At the time of the extension, the outstanding balance of the loan totaled approximately $13.1 million and was scheduled to mature on November 17, 2018. The extended loan has a total commitment amount of approximately $14.3 million, bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum and matures on November 17, 2019, with one, one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions. Annapolis Junction Building Six is a Class A office property with approximately 119,000 net rentable square feet located in Annapolis, Maryland (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
On December 31, 2018, we entered into a distribution agreement with our partner in the joint venture in which we have a 50% interest and that owns Annapolis Junction. Under the agreement, the joint venture distributed its Annapolis Junction Building One property to the partner and the partner assumed the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property.

Stock Option and Incentive Plan
On February 6, 2018, BXP’s Compensation Committee approved a new equity-based, multi-year, long-term incentive program (the “2018 MYLTIP”) as a performance-based component of our overall compensation program. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” the 2018 MYLTIP has an aggregate value of approximately $13.3 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the four-year plan period under the graded vesting method (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
On February 4, 2018, the measurement period for our 2015 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s relative TSR performance, the final awards were determined to be 22.0% of target or an aggregate of approximately $3.6 million (after giving effect to voluntary employee separations). As a result, an aggregate of 337,847 2015 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.
Business and Growth Strategies
Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective are:

• | to target a few carefully selected geographic markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC, and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, developers, owners and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise. We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective tenants in various industries and where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities. Additionally, our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits; 


• | to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office, research and development space, as well as selected retail and residential space;


• | to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;


• | to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today’s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients;


• | to opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing;


• | to explore joint venture opportunities with existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital, and/or to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as developers, owners and managers of Class A office space and mixed-use complexes;


• | to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential;

6 


• | to seek third-party development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and


• | to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations. In the current economic climate with relatively low interest rates we have and will continue to attempt to lower the cost of our debt capital and seek opportunities to lock in such low rates through early debt repayment, refinancings and interest rate hedges. 

Growth Strategies
External Growth Strategies
We believe that our development experience, our organizational depth and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office properties and research and laboratory space, within budget and on schedule. We believe we are also well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:

• | our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support in excess of 17.1 million additional square feet of new office, retail and residential development;


• | our reputation gained through 49 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;


• | our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services;


• | our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;


• | our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas;


• | our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing;


• | our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets;


• | our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us; and


• | our relationship with domestic and foreign investors who seek to partner with companies like ours.

Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories:

• | Development in selected submarkets. We believe the selected development of well-positioned office buildings, residential buildings and mixed-use complexes may be justified in our markets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 49-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential. 

In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.
7 

Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.

• | Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals. We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions. Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXP’s common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis. Recent Treasury Regulations, may limit certain of the tax benefits previously available to sellers in these transactions. 


• | Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions, owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program.

Internal Growth Strategies
We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations. Additionally, our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space, resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and (3) to work with new or existing tenants with space expansion or contraction needs, leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:

• | Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants. In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers and amenities, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.

The average lease term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.5 years at December 31, 2018, and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2018, leases with respect to approximately 6.0% of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2019.

• | Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention. We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations. In addition, we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our tenants.

• | Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.


• | Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration. We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.


• | Re-development of existing assets. We believe the select re-development of assets within our portfolio, where through the ability to increase the building size and/or to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the asset’s current and future cash flows, may be desirable. This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the building’s size, improve building systems and sustainability features, and/or add tenant amenities, thereby increasing tenant demand, generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the long-term value of the property and the company. In the past, we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for increased density at several of our assets, providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location. Our strong regional relationships and recognized re-development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities
The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by BXP’s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Investment Policies
Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate
Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.
We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.
We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.
Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP’s common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages
While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXP’s qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership. As of December 31, 2018, we had two note receivables outstanding, which aggregated approximately $99.5 million. 
Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities
Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP’s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
Dispositions
Our decision to dispose or partially dispose of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that such action would be in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue of 1986, as amended, or the Code or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale. As of December 31, 2018, we have no properties that are subject to a tax protection agreement.
Financing Policies
The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole. However, our mortgages, credit facilities, joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. In addition, we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLP's publicly traded debt. 
The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.
Policies with Respect to Other Activities
As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in circumstances or to the tax code, the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property. We intend to make investments in such a 
10 

way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP.
Sustainability
As one of the largest developers, owners and managers of primarily Class A office properties in the United States, we actively work to promote our growth and operations in a sustainable and responsible manner across our five regions. Our sustainability strategy is broadly focused on the economic, social and environmental aspects of our activities, which include the design and construction of our new developments and the operation of our existing buildings. We are focused on creating healthy workspaces and high performance properties while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste and greenhouse gas emissions. To that end, we have publicly adopted long-term energy, emissions, water and waste goals that establish aggressive reduction targets. As a company with a core strategy of long-term ownership, we are committed to charitable giving, volunteerism and public realm investments that make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment while mutually benefiting our tenants, investors, employees and the communities in which we operate.
We have been recognized as an industry leader in sustainability. In 2018, BXP ranked among the top 8% of 874 real estate companies in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) assessment. 2018 was the seventh straight year that BXP has ranked in the top quartile of GRESB assessment participants, earning another “Green Star” recognition and the highest GRESB 5-star Rating. In 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018, BXP was selected by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) as a Leader in the Light Award winner. Nareit's annual Leader in the Light Awards honor Nareit member companies that have demonstrated superior and sustained sustainability practices. 
In March 2016, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) issued the provisional standard, Real Estate Owners, Developers & Investment Trusts Sustainability Accounting Standard. The provisional standards propose sustainability accounting metrics that have been designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as the Form 10-K. The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area (“Energy Intensity”); percentage of eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR® (“ENERGY STAR certified”); total energy consumed by portfolio area (“Total Energy Consumption”); water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area (“Water Intensity”); and total water withdrawn by portfolio area (“Total Water Consumption”). Energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters. All utility data is checked by a third-party. A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications.
The charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2017 for which data on occupied and actively managed properties was available.
_______________

(1) | Full 2018 calendar year energy and water data is not available fully checked by a third party until March 31, 2019. 2017 is the most recent year for which complete energy and water data is available and checked by a third party. 

11 


(2) | The charts reflect the performance of our occupied and actively managed office building portfolio in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. Occupied office buildings are buildings with no more than 50% vacancy. Actively managed buildings are buildings where we have operational control of building system performance and investment decisions. At the end of the 2017 calendar year, this included 101 buildings totaling 39.4 million gross square feet.


(3) | Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) is obtained by us for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the fiscal year, regardless of when such data was obtained.


(4) | The scope of energy includes energy purchased from sources external to us and our tenants or produced by us or our tenants and energy from all sources, including fuel, gas, electricity and steam.


(5) | Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the registrant, wastewater obtained from other entities, municipal water supplies or supply from other water utilities.


(6) | During the 2017 calendar year, 66 buildings representing 61% of our eligible portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified.

We are committed to transparent reporting of environmental, social and governance sustainability indicators. BXP publishes an annual sustainability report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative reporting framework. More detailed sustainability information, including our strategy, key performance indicators, annual like-for-like comparisons, achievements and historical sustainability reports are available on our website at http://www.bostonproperties.com under the heading “Sustainability.” Except for the documents specifically incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
We compete in the leasing of office, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc.
Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services and amenities provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
In addition, we currently have six residential properties (including two under construction) and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties. As an owner, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators/owners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties.
Our Hotel Property
We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income, while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns the profit from operating the property as a hotel. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary.

Recent Tax Legislation Affecting BXP and BPLP
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus dated June 2, 2017 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on June 2, 2017, as well as the disclosures under “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus supplement dated June 2, 2017.

Consolidated Appropriations Act
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (the “CAA”), which amended various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. As a result, the discussion under “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations-Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock-Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders” in the second full paragraph on page 65 and in the first full paragraph on page 66 of each of the three documents listed above, respectively, is replaced with the following paragraphs: 
Qualified Shareholders. For periods on or after December 18, 2015, to the extent our stock is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a “qualified shareholder,” it will not be treated as a USRPI. Further, to the extent such treatment applies, any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a USRPI. For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a non-U.S. stockholder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors,” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder’s stock (with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of USRPIs. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an “applicable investor” is a person who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules. Subject to the exception described above for qualified shareholders having one or more applicable investors, distributions received by qualified shareholders will be taxed as described above at -Dividends as if the distribution is not attributable to the sale of a USRPI. Gain treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock (including capital gain dividends and distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock under the rules described above at - Dividends) will not be subject to tax unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified shareholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, in which case the qualified shareholder generally will be subject to a tax at the graduated rates applicable to ordinary income, in the same manner as U.S. stockholders. 
Qualified Foreign Pension Funds. For periods on or after December 18, 2015, for FIRPTA purposes neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a non-U.S. stockholder. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. Distributions received by qualified foreign pension funds and their wholly owned non-U.S. subsidiaries will be taxed described above at - Dividends as if the distribution is not attributable to the sale of a USRPI. Gain of a qualified foreign pension fund or its wholly owned on-U.S. subsidiary treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock, as well as our capital gain dividends and distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock under the rules described above at - Dividends, will not be subject to tax unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified foreign pension fund’s (or the subsidiary’s, as applicable) conduct of a U.S. trade or business, in which case the qualified foreign pension fund (or wholly owned subsidiary) generally will be subject to a tax at the graduated rates applicable to ordinary income, in the same manner as U.S. stockholders.

Recent FATCA Regulations 
On December 18, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus and the prospectus supplement. While these regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions) As a result, the discussion under “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations-Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock-Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Withholding on Certain Foreign Accounts and Entities” the prospectus and the prospectus supplement (found on page 66 of each) is replaced with the following:
Withholding on Certain Foreign Accounts and Entities. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, imposes withholding taxes on “withholdable payments” (as defined below) made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other non-U.S. entities unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or (2) the foreign non-financial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner. “Withholdable payment” generally means any payment of interest, dividends, and certain other types of generally passive income if such payment is from sources within the United States. If the payee is a foreign financial institution, it must enter into an agreement with the United States Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements. Investors in jurisdictions that have entered into “intergovernmental agreements” may, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, be required to report such information to their home jurisdictions. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding this legislation.
