Item 1. Business
Business Overview
Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. is an international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products in the property and casualty market. We target niches where we can develop a leadership position and where we believe we will generate superior underwriting profits. Our growth has been achieved both organically – through an operating strategy focused on disciplined underwriting – and as a result of strategic acquisitions.
The following is a summary organizational chart of Argo Group:
Business Segments and Products
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our operations included two reportable segments – U.S. Operations and International Operations. In addition to these main business segments, we have a Run-off Lines segment for certain products we no longer underwrite. For discussion of the operating results of each business segment, please refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 19, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
U.S. Operations
This segment is a leader in the U.S. Specialty Insurance market, specifically through its Excess and Surplus Lines ("E&S") businesses focusing on U.S.-based risks that the standard, admitted insurance market is unwilling or unable to underwrite, and through other specialized admitted and non-admitted business distributed through retail, wholesale, and managing general brokers/agents in the Specialty Insurance market. The standard insurance market’s limited appetite for such coverage is often driven by the insured’s unique risk characteristics, the perils involved, the nature of the business, and/or the insured’s loss experience.
2

The E&S businesses are often able to underwrite risks using more flexible policy terms and rating structures. The other U.S. businesses use their underwriting expertise in specific industry classes or exposures to write niche classes of business primarily in the admitted insurance market.
Our Excess and Surplus Lines businesses operate primarily through the Colony Specialty platform. While focused primarily on non-admitted business, Colony Specialty may also underwrite certain classes of business on an admitted basis.
Colony Specialty underwrites primary and excess casualty, property, and other coverage for hard-to-place risks and/or distressed businesses that typically fall outside of the standard insurance market’s risk appetite. This business is underwritten through the following business units: Casualty (which includes Construction), Transportation, Property, Contract and Environmental. Through these units, Colony Specialty provides coverage to a broad group of commercial enterprises, including contractors, manufacturers, distributors, property owners, retailers, restaurants and environmental consultants.
Our other, primarily admitted business units target classes and industries with distinct risk profiles that can benefit from specially designed insurance coverage, tailored loss control and expert claims handling. Under this focus, U.S. Operations includes the following business units: Argo Pro, Argo Insurance, Rockwood Casualty Insurance Company (“Rockwood”), U.S. Specialty Programs, Inland Marine, Argo Surety and Trident Public Risk Solutions (“Trident”). 
Argo Pro
Argo Pro is our mid-market professional lines platform that provides a broad portfolio of errors and omission, and management liability products to our wholesale and retail distribution partners. Argo Pro offers customized coverage on a primary and excess basis for risks on both an admitted and non-admitted basis, targeting commercial and select financial institution risks in the middle market and upper middle market segments. Our underwriting focus provides risk management solutions for accountants, architects and engineers, commercial crime, directors and officers, employment practices, fiduciary, lawyers, miscellaneous professionals, technology, privacy and security.
Argo Insurance
Argo Insurance offers insurance and risk management services to grocery, restaurants and other specialty retail industries. Using specific risk-control tools, Argo Insurance provides property, liability, workers compensation, automobile and umbrella coverage to accounts throughout the United States, primarily on a large deductible and self-insured retention basis.
Rockwood
Rockwood is primarily a specialty underwriter of workers compensation for the mining industry. It also underwrites coverage for small commercial businesses, including retail operations, light manufacturing, services and restaurants. Approximately 45% of its premiums are written in Pennsylvania. Rockwood underwrites policies on both a large-deductible basis and on a guaranteed-cost basis for smaller commercial accounts. In addition, Rockwood provides general liability and commercial automobile coverage, as well as coverage for pollution liability, umbrella liability, and surety to support its core clients’ other mining and mining-related exposures.
U.S. Specialty Programs
U.S. Specialty Programs offers specialized commercial niche programs customized to meet the specific insurance needs of targeted businesses. This unit provides solutions crafted specifically for each program opportunity. Its internal and external network includes experienced program administrators with successful track records with specialized underwriting expertise. 
Inland Marine
The Inland Marine business unit offers insurance coverage in the U.S. for builders risk, motor-truck cargo, equipment, and other miscellaneous marine risks. Coverage is provided on a monoline basis with both primary and excess coverages available.
Argo Surety
Argo Surety provides surety solutions to businesses that must satisfy various eligibility conditions in order to conduct commerce, such as licensure requirements required by government statute or regulation, counterparty conditions found in private or public construction projects, or satisfactory performance of contracted services. Surety products are commonly grouped into two broad categories referred to as commercial bonds and contract bonds. Commercial bonds are generally required of businesses that guarantee their compliance with regulations and statutes, the payment and performance assurance for various forms of contractual obligations, or the completion of services. Contract bonds are typically third-party performance, payment or maintenance guarantees associated with construction projects. Argo Surety primarily writes Commercial bonds targeting multiple industries, including construction (general, trade and service 
3

contractors), manufacturing, transportation, energy (coal, oil and gas), waste management, industrial equipment, technology, retail, public utilities and healthcare.
Trident Public Risk Solutions
Trident provides primary insurance products and risk management solutions for public-sector entities such as counties, municipalities, public schools, and other local government units and special districts. Its product lines include general liability, automobile liability, automobile physical damage, property, inland marine, crime, public officials liability, educators legal liability, employment practices liability, law enforcement liability and workers compensation coverage.
International Operations
This segment specializes in insurance and reinsurance risks worldwide through the broker market, focusing on specialty property insurance, property catastrophe reinsurance, primary/excess casualty and professional liability insurance. This segment includes a multi-class Lloyd’s Syndicate platform, a strong Bermuda trading platform and growing businesses in Continental Europe and Brazil.
This segment operates as ArgoGlobal in addition to other brands depending on product and jurisdiction, including Ariel Re, Argo Re, the Casualty and Professional Lines unit of Argo Insurance Bermuda, ArgoGlobal SE in Continental Europe, ArgoGlobal Assicurazioni (“ArgoGlobal Assicurazioni”) S.p.A in Italy and Argo Seguros Brazil, S.A. (“Argo Seguros”) in Brazil.
Lloyd’s Syndicate Platform
Argo’s Lloyd’s Syndicate platform includes Syndicate 1200 and Syndicate 1910. Based in London, the syndicates have regional operations in Bermuda, Dubai, Singapore and Shanghai. The syndicates are managed by the Argo Managing Agency and trade under the Lloyd’s of London capital and licensing framework.
Syndicate 1200 is focused on underwriting worldwide property, non-U.S. liability, marine and energy and specialty insurance. The property division of Syndicate 1200 concentrates mainly on North American commercial properties, but is also active in the residential sector, including collateral protection insurance programs for lending institutions. A portion of business is underwritten through the use of binding authorities, whereby we delegate underwriting authority to another party, usually a broker or underwriting agent. The liability division underwrites professional indemnity, general liability, medical malpractice, casualty and motor treaty, directors and officers and cyber insurance with emphasis on Canada, Australia and the U.K. The marine and energy division underwrites cargo, upstream and downstream energy, hull and marine liability insurance. The specialty division underwrites personal accident, credit and political risks, livestock and contingency insurance.
Approximately one half of Syndicate 1200's underwriting capital is related to third parties, including other (re)insurance groups (“trade capital”) and high net worth individuals (“Names”) who want to participate in our underwriting. Trade capital providers participate on a quota share basis behind an Argo-owned corporate member or directly through their own member. The flexibility in the sources of capital allows us to manage underwriting exposure over the insurance cycle. Our economic participation in the syndicate varies by year of account based on our risk appetite and the availability of third party capital. This business earns a return on the underwriting capital that is provided by us and from fee income earned from the management of third-party capital.
Syndicate 1910 underwrites reinsurance through our reinsurance division, Ariel Re, which operates in two areas - treaty property and specialty, and property insurance exposures through Argo Insurance Bermuda, a division of Argo Re. Treaty property reinsurance is predominantly catastrophe-focused. Specialty reinsurance encompasses marine, energy, aviation, terrorism and property. This reinsurance portfolio is focused on treaties where high-quality exposure and experience data allow our underwriters to quantify the risk. The property insurance business is focused on mainly North American commercial properties and writes on both a primary and excess basis. Business is written on an open market basis through retail and wholesale brokers.
Syndicate 1910 also obtains a portion of its underwriting capital from third party sources and seeks to maintain a balance between capital provided by us and capital managed on behalf of third parties. The sources of the underwriting capital for Syndicate 1910 include our interest and capital from trade capital and Names. The flexibility in the sources of capital allows us to manage underwriting exposure over the insurance cycle. Our economic participation in the syndicate varies by year of account based on our risk appetite and the availability of third-party capital.
Bermuda Insurance, Europe and Brazil
The additional international businesses include Argo Insurance Bermuda, ArgoGlobal SE, ArgoGlobal Assicurazioni in Italy and Argo Seguros business in Brazil.

Argo Insurance Bermuda offers casualty, property and professional lines, which serves the needs of global clients by providing the following coverages: property, general and products liability, directors and officers liability, errors and omissions liability and employment practices liability.
ArgoGlobal SE is based in Malta and underwrites professional liability, surety, and property and casualty business in continental Europe.
ArgoGlobal Assicurazioni is a specialty underwriter of property, marine, accident & health and liability insurance in the European market with a focus on Italy and Southern Europe.
Argo Seguros is our property and casualty insurance company based in Sao Paolo, Brazil, which is focused on serving that country’s domestic commercial insurance market. Argo Seguros provides a broad range of commercial property, casualty and specialty coverages. Its primary lines of business are cargo and marine, property, and engineering and financial lines. 
Run-off Lines
The Run-off Lines segment includes outstanding liabilities associated with discontinued lines previously underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries, such as those arising from liability policies dating back to the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s; risk management policies written by a business unit that has since been sold to a third party; and other legacy accounts previously written by our reinsurance subsidiaries.
Marketing and Distribution
We provide products and services to well-defined niche markets. We use our capital strength and the Argo Group brands to cross-market the products offered by our segments among our operating platforms and divisions. We offer our distribution partners tailored, innovative solutions for managing risk using the full range of products and services we have available.
U.S. Operations
Within U.S. Operations, Colony Specialty distributes its products through a network of appointed wholesale agents and brokers specializing in excess and surplus lines and certain targeted admitted lines. Approximately two-thirds of Colony Specialty’s premium volume in 2018 was produced by wholesale brokers who submit business and rely on Colony Specialty to produce quotes and handle policy issuance on such accounts. The remaining one-third of Colony Specialty’s premium was produced through a select group of wholesale agents to whom Colony Specialty has delegated limited authority to act on its behalf. These agents are granted authority to underwrite, quote, bind and issue policies in accordance with predetermined guidelines and procedures prescribed by Colony Specialty.
The remainder of the U.S. business uses a broad distribution platform to deliver specialty insurance products and services to our policyholders and agents. Argo Pro distributes its products through wholesale agents, brokers and retail agents. Argo Insurance products and services are distributed through select retail agents, brokers, wholesale agents and program managers with demonstrated expertise. Rockwood distributes its product lines through its network of retail and wholesale agents. U.S. Specialty Programs provides its products through selected managing general agents ("MGAs") and brokers.  Inland Marine uses selected retail agents and brokers. Trident provides its insurance products and related services through select retail agents, brokers and state program managers. Argo Surety distributes its products through select surety specialty agents and brokers across the United States.
International Operations
Syndicate 1200 obtains its insurance business from two main sources: the Lloyd’s open market and underwriting agencies with delegated authority. In the Lloyd’s open market, brokers approach Syndicate 1200 directly with risk opportunities for consideration by our underwriters. Brokers also approach Syndicate 1200 on behalf of selected underwriting agencies that are granted limited authority delegated by the Syndicate 1200 to make underwriting decisions on these risks. In general, risks written in the open market are larger than risks written on our behalf by authorized agencies in terms of both exposure and premium.
Syndicate 1910 originates business directly through our Lloyd's platform, as well as business originated outside of Lloyd's. All of our reinsurance ultimately resides in Syndicate 1910 through our internal capital framework, including the use of intercompany quota share arrangements.
The additional International Operations’ businesses obtain business through brokers and third-party intermediaries. The businesses' marketing and distribution strategies are based on territories with employees in countries around the world, including: the United Kingdom, Bermuda, Belgium, France, Germany, Brazil, Switzerland, Malta and an office in the United States (Miami) serving the offshore needs of the Latin American market.

Competition
We compete in a wide variety of markets against numerous and varied competitors, depending on the nature of the risk and coverage being written. The competition for any one account may range from large international firms to smaller regional companies in the domiciles in which we operate.
To remain competitive, our strategy includes, among other elements: (1) focusing on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline while providing a competitively priced product; (2) leveraging our distribution network by providing product solutions; (3) controlling expenses; (4) maintaining financial strength and issuer credit ratings; (5) providing quality services to agents and policyholders, including claims handling, rate, quote, bind and issue technologies to make it easier to write business; and (6) exploiting opportunities to acquire suitable books of business.
U.S. Operations
Competition within the excess and surplus lines marketplace comes from a wide range of national and global carriers. In addition to mature companies that operate nationwide, competition comes from carriers formed in recent years. The Excess and Surplus Lines businesses may also compete with national and regional carriers from the standard market that are willing to underwrite policies on selected accounts on an admitted basis.
Due to the diverse nature of the products offered by our other U.S. Operations businesses, competition comes from various sources, but largely from regional companies or specific units / subsidiaries of national carriers. National carriers tend to compete for larger accounts along all product lines. Competition for Trident comes from a wide range of commercial insurers, but also from state and regional governmental risk pools.
International Operations
Competition for any one account may come from other Lloyd’s syndicates, international firms or smaller regional companies. These competitors include independent insurance and reinsurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, departments of certain commercial insurance companies, and underwriting syndicates.
Ratings
Ratings are an important factor in assessing our competitive position and our ability to meet our ongoing obligations. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the agency providing such a rating. Moreover, the ratings of each agency should be evaluated independently as the rating methodology and evaluation process may differ. The ratings issued on us or our subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on our website and the respective rating agency’s websites. We have two types of ratings: (i) Financial Strength Ratings (“FSR”) and (ii) Debt Ratings or Issuer Credit Ratings (“ICR”).
Financial Strength Ratings reflect the rating agency’s assessment of an insurer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders. With the exception of Argo Seguros (which is not rated), all of our insurance and reinsurance companies have an FSR of “A” (Excellent) from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have an FSR of “A-” (Strong) from Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), with positive outlook.
Debt Ratings and Issuer Credit Ratings reflect the rating agency’s assessment of a company’s prospects for repaying its debts and can be considered by lenders in connection with the setting of interest rates and terms for a company’s short-term or long-term borrowings. Argo Group U.S., Inc. has an ICR and senior unsecured debt rating of “BBB-” from S&P. Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. has an ICR and senior unsecured Debt Rating of “bbb” from A.M. Best. Except for ARIS Title and Argo Seguros, all of our insurance and reinsurance companies have an ICR of “a” from A.M. Best.
A.M. Best Financial Strength Ratings range from “A++” (Superior) to “S” (Suspended) and include 16 separate ratings categories. S&P Financial Strength Ratings range from “AAA” (Extremely Strong) to “R” (under regulatory supervision) and include 21 separate ratings categories.
Syndicates 1200 and 1910, our Lloyd’s syndicates, operate with the Lloyd’s market FSR rating of “A” (Excellent) with a stable outlook by A.M. Best and “A+” (Strong) with a negative outlook by S&P.

Regulation
General
The business of insurance and reinsurance and related services is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies from one jurisdiction to another. The principal jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance businesses operate are Bermuda, various state regulators in the United States, the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom and Brazil. We are also regulated by other countries and jurisdictions where we do business. Our group regulatory supervisor is the Bermuda Monetary Authority ("BMA").
Bermuda
Insurance Company and Insurance Group Supervision and Regulation Scheme
Many of Bermuda’s insurance groups subject to supervision are internationally active. Therefore, Bermuda’s group supervision framework reflects international developments in this area and principles for insurance group supervision adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.
Based on the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (“the Insurance Act”), as amended from time to time, Bermuda maintains a progressive, risk-based supervisory system for registered Insurance Companies and for selected Insurance Groups.
A number of Bermuda registered (re)insurers operate within a group structure, meaning that a local insurer’s financial position and risk profile, and its overall prudential position, may be impacted by being part of a group, both positively and negatively. Therefore, the BMA has established a group supervision framework for insurance groups. The BMA conducts its responsibilities and powers as Group Supervisor under the Insurance Act, and the supporting legislation, the Insurance (Group Supervision) Rules 2011 and the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Insurance Groups Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011.
The main objectives of group supervision include (a) policyholder protection, (b) ensuring at least one supervisor has an overall view of the group and its associated risks and (c) addressing any supervisory gaps, the risk of contagion and the impact of any unregulated entities within a group. Therefore, key areas of focus within the group supervision framework are (1) ensuring solvency at group level, (2) monitoring inter-group transactions and (3) assessing corporate governance, risk management and internal control processes of insurance groups. In conducting its function as Group Supervisor, the BMA, among other things, convenes and conducts supervisory colleges with other supervisory authorities that have regulatory oversight of entities within a group and coordinates the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information from groups for going concern or emergency situations.
In May 2011, the BMA gave notice that it had determined itself to be the proper group supervisor for us for purposes of its Group Supervision regime, and nominated Argo Re to serve as the designated insurer. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries are deemed to be an affiliated group supervised by the BMA under applicable rules and regulations in Bermuda.
In 2018, the BMA, convened its annual supervisory college sessions relative to Argo Group, which included participation by the U.K. Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Insurance Departments of the States of Illinois and Virginia. Argo Group management was also asked to attend and to make a presentation.
The BMA is also responsible for the supervision, regulation and inspection of Bermuda domiciled insurance companies and for the licensing of all insurance companies, brokers, agents and managers doing business in Bermuda. The Insurance Act and its supporting legislation, the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and 3B Solvency Requirement), the Insurance (Eligible Capital) Rules, as well as various other policies and guidance notes, including the Insurance Code of Conduct, provide the BMA with substantive licensing and intervention powers.
These rules provide for significant reporting requirements related to us and our consolidated financial condition.
Solvency Regulation Scheme
Bermuda continues to enhance its risk-based regulatory regime, to meet or exceed international standards, including Solvency II (“S II”) as enacted by the EU in November 2009. On March 24, 2016, the European Commission’s recommendation that Bermuda achieve full Solvency II equivalence was confirmed in the Official Journal of the European Union, with retroactive application to January 1, 2016. The European Commission announced its approval of Bermuda’s commercial (re)insurance regime as being fully equivalent to the regulatory standards applied under S II.
Many of the areas covered under this initiative have been phased in over recent years. The BMA has enhanced its existing regime consisting of three core components: (1) Capital Adequacy, (2) Governance and Risk Management and (3) Disclosure and Reporting. Most of these 
7

core components are interconnected and potentially influenced by developments in other international regimes. Insurance companies as well as insurance groups are also subject to the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”), a risk-based capital system mandated by the above mentioned rules.
Regulation of Argo Re
Classification of Insurers
The Insurance Act distinguishes between special purpose insurers, insurers operating a long-term business and insurers operating a general business. There are various classifications of insurers operating a general business, with Class 4 insurers subject to the highest level of regulation. Argo Re, which is incorporated to operate a general insurance and reinsurance business, is registered as a Class 4 insurer in Bermuda and is regulated as such under the Insurance Act. Under the Insurance Act, no distinction is made between insurance and reinsurance business.
Principal Representative and Principal Office
As an insurer, Argo Re is required to maintain a principal office and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. The principal representative is required to give notice to the BMA regarding certain events relating to solvency, significant losses, proposed changes in ownership, changes in membership of the Board of Directors or our senior management, and other material changes defined in the Insurance Act. In some instances, prior approval may be required for a proposed action that is the subject of a notice.
Controlling Shareholders of an Insurer; Effect on Ownership of Shares in the Company
The definition of a “shareholder controller” is set out in the Insurance Act, but generally refers to a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders’ meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company. More stringent requirements apply at certain thresholds to those holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more.  The BMA also has the power under the Insurance Act, at any time, by written notice, to object to any “controller” (including a shareholder controller) if it appears to the BMA that such person is not a fit and proper person to be such a controller.  The BMA may require a shareholder controller to reduce its holding of our common shares and direct, among other things, that voting rights attaching to the common shares shall not be exercisable.
Dividends
Any dividend payments to Argo Re become part of the capital and surplus of Argo Re, at which point further upward distribution to Argo Group is subject to Bermuda insurance and solvency regulations as discussed above.
In 2018 and 2016, Argo Re paid a cash dividend of $36.5 million and $41.0 million, respectively to Argo Group. The proceeds of the dividends were used to repay intercompany balances related primarily to the funding of dividend and interest payments and other corporate expenses. In 2017, Argo Re did not pay a dividend to Argo Group.
Financial Condition Report
In 2018, Argo Group filed a Financial Condition Report (“FCR”) with the BMA and on its public website under the Insurance (Public Disclosure) Rules 2015 pursuant to the Insurance Act. The purpose of this Financial Condition Report for Argo Group is to provide a public disclosure of the measures governing the Company’s business operations, corporate governance framework, solvency, financial performance and management of significant events. The FCR was reviewed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and posted on the Argo public website in June 2018. The FCR is an annual filing and provides additional information to the public in relation to the Company’s business model. The 2018 FCR was used to meet new NAIC Corporate Governance Annual Disclosures ("CGAD") reporting requirements applying to Argo Group U.S. as a result of the passing of the CGAD Model Act. It is anticipated this will be repeated for the 2019 filing.
United States
State Insurance Regulation
Argo Group U.S., Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of the states in which they are domiciled. We currently have twelve insurance companies domiciled in five states (the “U.S. Insurance Entities”). Argo Group U.S., Inc., as the parent of the U.S. Insurance Entities, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. These laws generally require each of the U.S. Insurance Entities to submit annual holding company registration statements to its respective domestic state insurance departments and to furnish annual financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company group, including the filing of an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report with the Illinois Director of Insurance, as the lead state regulator. In order to assess the business strategy, financial position, legal and regulatory position, risk 
8

exposure, risk management, and governance processes, the Illinois Director of Insurance may participate in a supervisory college with other regulators who are interested in the supervision of an Illinois domestic insurer or its affiliates, including other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies. Generally, all material transactions among companies in the holding company group to which any of the U.S. Insurance Entities is a party, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements and service agreements, must be fair and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval by the insurance department where the subsidiary is domiciled. Transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the holding company group may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by, state regulatory authorities in the domiciliary states. Such supervision and regulation is intended to primarily protect our policyholders. Matters relating to authorized lines of business, underwriting standards, financial condition standards, licensing of insurers, investment standards, premium levels, policy provisions, the filing of annual and other financial reports prepared on the basis of Statutory Accounting Principles, the filing and form of actuarial reports, dividends and a variety of other financial and non-financial matters are also areas that are regulated and supervised by the states in which our U.S. Insurance Entities are domiciled.
Cyber Regulations 
The New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") issued Cybersecurity Regulations for Financial Services Companies that require certain of our insurance operations to, among other things, establish and maintain a cybersecurity policy, a cybersecurity breach incident response process and to designate a Chief Information Security Officer. These Regulations first came into effect in 2017 with a two -year transition period. In addition, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law in October 2017. The purpose of this Model Law is to establish recommended standards for data security and for the notification to insurance commissioners of cybersecurity incidents involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain non-public information.
Guaranty Associations
Our licensed U.S. Insurance Entities are participants in the statutorily created insolvency guaranty associations in all states where they are licensed carriers. These associations were formed for the purpose of paying return of unearned premium and claims of licensed insolvent insurance companies. The licensed U.S. Insurance Entities are assessed their pro rata share of such guaranty fund payments based upon their written premiums, subject to a maximum annual assessment per line of insurance. Such assessments costs may be recovered, in certain jurisdictions, through the application of surcharges on future premiums or premium tax offsets. Except in the state of New Jersey, non-admitted business is neither supported by nor subject to guaranty assessments.
Dividends
All of the U.S. Insurance Entities are subsidiaries of Argo Group U.S., Inc., meaning that any dividends from the U.S. Insurance Entities are payable in the first instance to Argo Group U.S., Inc. prior to being passed upward as dividends to Argo Group. The ability of our U.S. Insurance Entities to pay dividends is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the jurisdictions of domicile that regulate our U.S. Insurance Entities and each such jurisdiction imposes limitations upon the amount of dividends that an insurance company may pay without the approval of its insurance regulator.
Argo Group U.S., Inc. may receive dividends from its direct subsidiaries: Argonaut Insurance Company and Rockwood Casualty Insurance Company. During 2019, Argonaut Insurance Company may be permitted to pay dividends up to $89.6 million without approval from the Illinois Department of Insurance, based on the application of the Illinois ordinary dividend calculation. Rockwood may be permitted, during 2019, to pay dividends up to $12.6 million without approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, based on the application of Pennsylvania’s ordinary dividend calculation. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Rockwood paid an ordinary dividend to Argo Group U.S., Inc. in the amount of $20.0 million. Business and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of dividends actually paid, and prior regulatory approval of extraordinary dividend payments is required.
State laws require prior notice or regulatory approval of direct or indirect changes in control of an insurer, reinsurer or its holding company, and certain significant inter-corporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure. An investor who acquires or attempts to acquire shares representing or convertible into more than 10% of the voting power of the securities of Argo Group would become subject to at least some of these laws, would be required to obtain approval from the five domiciliary regulators of the U.S. Insurance Entities prior to acquiring such shares and would be required to file certain notices and reports with the five domiciliary regulators prior to such acquisition.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act
On November 26, 2002, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”).  On January 12, 2015, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014, 
9

which extends TRIA through December 31, 2020. Under TRIA commercial insurers are required to offer insurance coverage against terrorist incidents and are reimbursed by the federal government for paid claims subject to deductible and retention amounts. TRIA, and its related rules, contain certain definitions, requirements and procedures for insurers filing claims with the Treasury for payment of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (“TRIP”). TRIP is a temporary federal program that has been extended by TRIA to provide for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.  The Treasury implements the program. On June 29, 2004, the Treasury issued a final Claims Procedures Rule, effective July 31, 2004, as part of its implementation of Title I of TRIA.  TRIA also contains specific provisions designed to manage litigation arising out of, or resulting from, a certified act of terrorism, and on July 28, 2004, the Treasury issued a final Litigation Management Rule for TRIA. The Claims Procedures Rule specifically addresses requirements for Federal payment, submission of an initial notice of insured loss, loss certifications, timing and process for payment, associated recordkeeping requirements, as well as the Treasury’s audit and investigation authority.  These procedures will apply to all insurers that wish to receive their payment of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses under TRIA.  
Additional materials addressing TRIA and TRIP, including Treasury issued interpretive letters, are contained on the Treasury’s website.
European Union (EU)
The S II regulatory regime in the EU, imposes solvency and governance requirements across all 28 EU Member States. 
S II, imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements across all 28 European Member States and consists of three pillars: (1) Pillar I - quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet; (2) Pillar II - qualitative regulatory review, which includes governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and supervisory review process; and (3) Pillar III - market discipline, which is accomplished through reporting of the insurer's financial condition to regulators.
Our Lloyd’s Managing Agency, Argo Managing Agency Limited, which manages Syndicate 1200, Syndicate 1910 and Special Purpose Arrangement 6117 (“SPA 6117”) at Lloyd’s, and ArgoGlobal SE (Malta) are required to comply with S II.  
United Kingdom
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (including Amendments) and The Financial Services Act 2012
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (including Amendments) and the Financial Services Act 2012 provide regulators with comprehensive powers to counter future risks to financial stability and to ensure that consumers are treated fairly.
The Bank of England has macro-prudential responsibility for oversight of the financial system and, through the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”), for day-to-day prudential supervision of financial services firms managing significant balance-sheet risk. The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) protects consumers, promotes competition and ensures integrity in markets.
PRA and FCA Regulations
Argo Managing Agency Limited, managing agent of Syndicate 1200, Syndicate 1910 and SPA 6117, is authorized by the PRA and regulated by the PRA and the FCA, as well as being supervised by Lloyd’s.  The PRA, FCA and Lloyd’s have common objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd’s market is appropriately regulated.  To minimize duplication, there are arrangements with Lloyd’s for co-operation on supervision and enforcement.  Both the PRA and FCA have substantial powers of intervention in relation to the Lloyd’s Managing Agents (such as Argo Managing Agency Limited) that they regulate, including the power to remove their authorization to manage Lloyd’s Syndicates.  In addition, each year the PRA requires Lloyd’s to satisfy an annual solvency test that measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off.  If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may require Lloyd’s to cease trading and/or its members to cease or reduce underwriting.

The operations of Syndicate 1200, Syndicate 1910 and SPA 6117 are supervised by Lloyd’s. The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. The Lloyd’s Franchise Board is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the Lloyd’s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all Syndicates, including reviewing and approving the Syndicates’ annual business plans. The Lloyd’s Franchise Board requires annual approval of Syndicate 1200’s, Syndicate 1910’s and SPA 6117’s business plans, including maximum underwriting capacity, and may require changes to any business plan presented to it or that additional capital be provided to support underwriting. Lloyd’s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members.

The Argo Group predominantly participates in the Lloyd’s Market as a Lloyd’s corporate member on Syndicate 1200 and Syndicate 1910 through Argo (No 604) Ltd. By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, Argo (No 604) Ltd undertakes to comply with all Lloyd’s by-laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that are applicable to it. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s”) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined by Lloyd’s. The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. These requirements allow Lloyd’s to evaluate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin.
If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its claims to policyholders, such claims may be payable by the Lloyd’s Central Fund. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Council of Lloyd’s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution.

Argo Re Ltd. and Argo Re Escritório are subject to Brazil’s laws and regulations relating to business activities as an admitted reinsurer.
Reinsurance
As is common practice within the insurance industry, Argo Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries transfer a portion of the risks insured under their policies by entering into a reinsurance treaty with another insurance or reinsurance company. Purchasing reinsurance protects carriers against the frequency and/or severity of losses incurred on the policies they issue, such as an unusually large individual claim or serious occurrence in which a number of claims on one policy aggregate to produce an extraordinary loss or where a catastrophe generates a large number of claims on multiple policies at the same time.
As a specialty reinsurer, we purchase a broad-based series of reinsurance programs in an effort to mitigate the risk of significant capital deterioration, as well as to minimize the volatility of earnings against the impact of a single, large catastrophe or several smaller, but still significant catastrophe events. These programs are structured with the intention of limiting the financial impact of significant catastrophe losses in a given fiscal year to no more than one quarter’s earnings.
Reinsurance does not discharge the issuing primary carrier from its obligation to pay a policyholder for losses insured under its policy. Rather, the reinsured portion of each loss covered under a reinsurance treaty is ceded to the assuming reinsurer for reimbursement to the 
12

primary carrier. Because this creates a receivable owed by the reinsurer to the ceding carrier, there is credit exposure to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under its reinsurance treaty. The ability to collect on reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. We are selective in regard to our reinsurers, seeking out those with stronger financial strength ratings from A.M. Best or S&P. However, the financial condition of a reinsurer may change over time based on market conditions. We perform credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on a number of criteria including, but not limited to, financial condition, stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business. In certain instances, we also require deposit of assets in trust, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral. This would be to support balances due from reinsurers whose financial strength ratings fall below a certain level or who transact business on a non-admitted basis in the case of the U.S. insurance entities in the state where the reinsured subsidiary is domiciled, or who provide reinsurance only on a collateralized basis.
At December 31, 2018, Argo Group’s reinsurance recoverable balance totaled $2,688.3 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.8 million. The following table reflects the credit ratings for our reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2018:

 | 2018 
(in millions) | ReinsuranceRecoverables | | % of Total
Ratings per A.M. Best | 
Reinsurers rated A+ or better | $ | 1,451.4 | | | 54.1 | %
Reinsurers rated A | 605.5 | | | 22.5 | % 
Reinsurers rated A- | 156.9 | | | 5.8 | % 
Reinsurers rated below A- or not rated | 474.5 | | | 17.6 | % 
 | $ | 2,688.3 | | | 100.0 | %

Nine of the top ten reinsurers, rated A or higher, accounted for $1,472.1 million, or approximately 55% of the reinsurance recoverable balance as of December 31, 2018. Management has concluded that all balances (net of any allowances for doubtful accounts) are considered recoverable as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we hold collateral for 66% of the amounts recoverable from reinsurers rated below A- or not rated.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Argo Group records reserves for specific claims incurred and reported, as well as reserves for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). The estimates of losses for reported claims are established judgmentally on an individual case basis. Such estimates are based on our particular experience with the type of risk involved and our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim. Reserves for reported claims consider our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle the claims, including investigation and defense of the claim, and may be adjusted for differences between costs originally estimated and costs re-estimated or incurred.
Reserves for IBNR claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs, including frequency and severity data and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Reserves established in prior years are adjusted as loss experience develops and new information becomes available.
The estimate of reinsurance recoverables related to reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the portion of the gross liabilities that are anticipated to be recovered from reinsurers. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are recognized as assets at the same time as, and in a manner consistent with, the estimate of the gross losses covered by the reinsurance treaty.
We are subject to and establish estimates for claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, severe winter weather, fires and man-made events, such as terrorist attacks.
We have discontinued underwriting certain lines of business; however, we are still obligated to pay losses incurred on these lines. Certain lines currently in run-off are characterized by long elapsed periods between the occurrence of a claim and any ultimate payment to resolve the claim. Included in Run-off Lines segment are claims related to asbestos and environmental liabilities arising out of liability policies primarily written in the 1960s, 1970s and into the early1980s with a limited number of claims occurring on policies written in the early 1990s. Business formerly written in our Risk Management business is also classified in the Run-off Lines segment. Additional discussion 
13

on the Run-off Lines segment can be found under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Additional information relating to our loss reserve development is included under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 5, “Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investments
Investment Strategy and Guidelines
Our investment portfolio is designed to ensure adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of our obligations, including any potential claims payments. To ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims, we broadly seek to match the profile of our invested assets with those of our liabilities. We consider liquidity, anticipated duration, and the currency of our liabilities when making investment decisions. To meet our liquidity needs, our core bond portfolio consists primarily of investment grade, fixed-maturity securities. As of December 31, 2018, fixed maturities, along with cash and short-term investments, represented 79.0% of our total investments and cash equivalents.
In an effort to meet business needs and mitigate risks, our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio’s composition, including issuer limits, sector limits, credit quality limits, portfolio duration, limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. Our investment managers may invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than the U.S. dollar based on where our business is underwritten, the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated, regulatory requirements, or our managers’ point of view on a given currency.
The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, currency fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. Investment guideline restrictions have been established in an effort to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control. A significant change in interest rates could result in losses, realized or unrealized, in the value of our investment portfolio. Additionally, with respect to some of our investments, we are subject to prepayment and possibly reinvestment risk. Certain investments are subject to restrictions on sale, transfer and redemption, which may limit our ability to withdraw funds or realize gains on such investments for some period of time after our initial investment. The values of, and returns on, such investments may also be more volatile.
Investment Committee and Investment Managers
The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors has approved an investment policy statement that contains investment guidelines and serves to govern our investment activity. The Investment Committee regularly monitors our overall investment results, compliance with investment objectives and guidelines and ultimately reports our overall investment results to the Board of Directors.
We currently use multiple professional investment managers to manage our portfolio. A small portion of the investment portfolio is managed internally.
Additional information relating to our investment portfolio is included under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 3, “Investments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
