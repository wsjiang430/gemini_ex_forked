Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when we use the terms "we," "us," "our," "Registrant," and the "Company" we mean Kadant Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, unless the context otherwise indicates. Unless otherwise noted, references to 2018, 2017, and 2016 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to our fiscal years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.
Description of Our Business
We are a leading global supplier of equipment and critical components used in process industries worldwide. In addition, we manufacture granules made from papermaking by-products. We have a diverse and large customer base, including most of the world's major paper, lumber and oriented strand board (OSB) manufacturers, and our products, technologies, and services play an integral role in enhancing process efficiency, optimizing energy utilization, and maximizing productivity in resource-intensive industries. 
Our continuing operations are comprised of two reportable operating segments, Papermaking Systems and Wood Processing Systems, and a separate product line, Fiber-based Products. Through our Papermaking Systems segment, we develop, manufacture, and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking, paper recycling, recycling and waste management, and other process industries. Our principal products include custom-engineered stock-preparation systems and equipment for the preparation of wastepaper for conversion into recycled paper and balers and related equipment used in the processing of recyclable and waste materials; fluid-handling systems and equipment used in industrial piping systems to compensate for movement and to efficiently transfer fluid, power, and data; doctoring systems and equipment and related consumables important to the efficient operation of paper machines and other industrial processes; and filtration and cleaning systems essential for draining, purifying, and recycling process water and cleaning fabrics, belts, and rolls in various process industries.
Through our Wood Processing Systems segment, we develop, manufacture, market, and supply debarkers, stranders, chippers, logging machinery, and related equipment used in the harvesting and production of lumber and OSB. Through this segment, we also provide refurbishment and repair of pulping equipment for the pulp and paper industry. 
Through our Fiber-based Products business, we manufacture and sell biodegradable, absorbent granules derived from papermaking by-products for use primarily as carriers for agricultural, home lawn and garden, and professional lawn, turf and ornamental applications, as well as for oil and grease absorption.
On January 2, 2019, we acquired Syntron Material Handling Group, LLC and certain of its affiliates (SMH) pursuant to an equity purchase agreement dated December 9, 2018, for approximately $179 million, subject to certain customary adjustments. SMH is a leading provider of material handling equipment and systems to various process industries, including mining, aggregates, food processing, packaging, and pulp and paper. This acquisition extends our current product portfolio, and we expect it will strengthen SMH's relationships in the pulp and paper markets. We are currently evaluating the segment classification of the SMH business.
