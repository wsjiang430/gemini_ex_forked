As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 2,661 full-time employees and 272 part-time and temporary employees.  None of the Company’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 The banking industry is highly regulated with numerous statutory and regulatory requirements that are designed primarily for the protection of depositors and the financial system, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders.  Set forth below is a description of the material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank.  This summary is not complete and the reader should refer to these laws and regulations for more detailed information.  The Company’s and the Bank’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in a range of sanctions and administrative actions imposed upon the Company and/or the Bank, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders.  Changes in applicable law or regulations, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, and may have a material effect on the Company’s business and results.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and the states and jurisdictions in which they conduct business.  The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) as its primary federal regulator.  The Bank is a nationally-chartered bank and is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) as its primary federal regulator, and as to certain matters, the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
 
The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and it is subject to NYSE’s rules for listed companies.  Affiliated entities, including BPAS, NRS, HB&T, HSI, BPAS Trust Company of Puerto Rico, Nottingham, CISI, OneGroup, and Carta Group are subject to the jurisdiction of certain state and federal regulators and self-regulatory organizations including, but not limited to, the SEC, the Texas Department of Banking, the State of Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, and state securities and insurance regulators.
 
Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation
 The Company was a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, (the “BHC Act”), and became a financial holding company effective September 30, 2015.  As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company, the Company can affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are “financial in nature” or “incidental” or “complementary” to activities that are financial in nature, as long as it continues to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding companies (including requirements that the financial holding company and its depository institution subsidiary maintain their status as “well capitalized” and “well managed”).
 
Generally, FRB approval is not required for the Company to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB.  Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.  Prior FRB approval is required before the Company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association.
 
Because the Company is a financial holding company, if the Bank were to receive a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (“CRA”), of less than Satisfactory, the Company will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to Satisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations, except that the Company could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are considered “closely related to banking” under the BHC Act.  In addition, if the FRB determines that the Company or the Bank is not well capitalized or well managed, the Company would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and may contain additional limitations or conditions.  Until corrected, the Company could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking, absent prior FRB approval.

Federal Reserve System Regulation
 Because the Company is a financial holding company, it is subject to regulatory capital requirements and required by the FRB to, among other things, maintain cash reserves against its deposits.  The Bank is under similar capital requirements administered by the OCC as discussed below.  FRB policy has historically required a financial holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) codifies this historical policy as a statutory requirement.  To the extent the Bank is in need of capital, the Company could be expected to provide additional capital, including borrowings from the FRB for such purpose.  Both the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive supervision and regulation, which focus on, among other things, the protection of depositors’ funds.
 
The FRB also regulates the national supply of bank credit in order to influence general economic conditions.  These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, and affect the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.
 
Fluctuations in interest rates, which may result from government fiscal policies and the monetary policies of the FRB, have a strong impact on the income derived from loans and securities, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  While the Company and the Bank strive to model various interest rate changes and adjust our strategies for such changes, the level of earnings can be materially affected by economic circumstances beyond our control.
 
The Office of Comptroller of the Currency Regulation
 The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the OCC.  The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC affect the Company’s practices such as payment of dividends, incurring debt, and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies.  It also affects the Bank’s business practices, such as payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, types of business conducted and the location of its offices.  The OCC generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions, including the payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would become undercapitalized due to the payment.  Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan to the OCC.  The Bank is well capitalized under regulatory standards administered by the OCC.  For additional information on our capital requirements see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Shareholders’ Equity” and Note P to the Financial Statements.
Federal Home Loan Bank
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions for home mortgage and neighborhood lending.  The Bank is subject to the rules and requirements of the FHLB, including the purchase of shares of FHLB activity-based stock in the amount of 4.5% of the dollar amount of outstanding advances and FHLB capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of $1,000 or the sum of 0.15% of the mortgage-related assets held by the Bank based upon the previous year-end financial information.  The Bank was in compliance with the rules and requirements of the FHLB at December 31, 2018.
Deposit Insurance
 Deposits of the Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.  The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per deposit category, per depositor, per institution.  A depository institution’s DIF assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment rate by the assessment base, which is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the depository institution.  The initial base assessment rate is based on its capital level and supervisory ratings (its “CAMELS ratings”), certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress and, in some cases, additional discretionary adjustments by the FDIC to reflect additional risk factors.  The Bank’s adjusted average consolidated total assets for 4 consecutive quarters exceeded $10.0 billion in 2018, which resulted in a deposit insurance assessment based on a large institution classification, rather than the small institution classification for years prior to 2018.
    For large insured depository institutions, generally defined as those with at least $10 billion in total assets, the FDIC has eliminated risk categories when calculating the initial base assessment rates and now combine CAMELS ratings and financial measures into two scorecards to calculate assessment rates, one for most large insured depository institutions and another for highly complex insured depository institutions (which are generally those with more than $50 billion in total assets that are controlled by a parent company with more than $500 billion in total assets). Each scorecard has two components - a performance score and loss severity score, which are combined and converted to an initial assessment rate. The FDIC has the ability to adjust a large or highly complex insured depository institution’s total score by a maximum of 15 points, up or down, based upon significant risk factors that are not captured by the scorecard. Under the current assessment rate schedule, the initial base assessment rate for large and highly complex insured depository institutions ranges from three to 30 basis points, and the total base assessment rate, after applying the unsecured debt and brokered deposit adjustments, ranges from one and one-half to 40 basis points.  The Bank’s FDIC insurance for 2018 was based on an assessment rate of three basis points.

In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reached 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  In September 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.36%, exceeding the required reserve ratio of 1.35% ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline.   FDIC insurance expense totaled $3.2 million, $3.5 million and $3.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
    Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, if the FDIC finds that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, the FDIC may determine that such violation or unsafe or unsound practice or condition require the termination of deposit insurance.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to the banking industry.  As discussed further throughout this section, certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to implementing rules that have been taking effect over several years.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all banks and bank holding companies and impacts how the Company and the Bank handle their operations.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies, including those that regulate the Company and the Bank, to promulgate new rules and regulations and to conduct various studies and reports for Congress.  The federal agencies have either completed or are in the process of completing these rules and regulations and have been given significant discretion in drafting such rules and regulations.  Several of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have the consequence of increasing the Bank’s expenses, decreasing its revenues, and changing the activities in which it chooses to engage.  The specific impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company’s current activities or new financial activities the Company may consider in the future, the Company’s financial performance, and the markets in which the Company operates depends on the manner in which the relevant agencies continue to develop and implement the required rules and regulations and the reaction of market participants to these regulatory developments.
 
Pursuant to FRB regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees on debit card transactions are limited to a maximum of $0.21 per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount.  A debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements prescribed by the FRB.  The FRB also adopted requirements in the final rule that issuers include two unaffiliated networks for routing debit transactions that are applicable to the Company and the Bank.  The Company became subject to the interchange fee cap mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning on July 1, 2018.  As such, the fees the Company may receive for an electronic debit transaction will be capped at the statutory limit.  Prior to July 1, 2018, the Company was exempt from the interchange fee cap under the “small issuer” exemption, which applies to any debit card issuer with total worldwide assets (including those of its affiliates) of less than $10 billion as of the end of the previous calendar year.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws.  Since the Company’s total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion the Company is subject to the direct supervision of the CFPB.  The CFPB has issued and continues to issue numerous regulations under which the Company and the Bank will continue to incur additional expense in connection with its ongoing compliance obligations.  Significant recent CFPB developments that may affect operations and compliance costs include:
 
  
· | positions taken by the CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory which could make it more difficult for lenders to charge different rates or to apply different terms to loans to different customers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the CFPB’s final rule amending Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring most lenders to report expanded information in order for the CFPB to more effectively monitor fair lending concerns and other information shortcomings identified by the CFPB; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | positions taken by the CFPB regarding the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, which require companies to obtain customer authorizations before automatically debiting a consumer’s account for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | focused efforts on enforcing certain compliance obligations the CFPB deems a priority, such as automobile loan servicing, debt collection, mortgage origination and servicing, remittances, and fair lending, among others. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The final rules issued by the FRB, SEC, OCC, FDIC, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (commonly known as the Volcker Rule) prohibit insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments, for their own account.  The final rules also impose limits on banking entities’ investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds.

In May of 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“Economic Growth Act”) was enacted to amend the Dodd-Frank Act and modify certain post-crisis regulatory requirements, including a variety of provisions intended to promote economic growth, provide tailored regulatory relief for smaller and less complex financial institutions, and enhance consumer protections.  Among other things, the law raised the asset size threshold for the filing of required company-run stress tests that the Dodd-Frank Act had applied to the Company and the Bank, from $10 billion to $250 billion in total assets.  As implemented by the federal banking agencies, these changes became effective in 2018 for banking organizations with total assets of less than $100 billion, such as the Bank.
 
The ongoing effects of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the recent and possible future changes to the regulatory framework as a result of the Economic Growth Act and future proposals make it difficult to assess the overall financial impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory developments on the Company and the banking industry.  As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company or the Bank, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  Nor can the Company predict the impact or substance of other future legislation or regulation.  However, it is expected that future legislation or regulation at a minimum will increase the Company’s and the Bank’s operating and compliance costs.  As rules and regulations continue to be implemented or issued, the Company may need to dedicate additional resources to ensure compliance, which may increase its costs of operations and adversely impact its earnings.
 
Capital Requirements
 The Company and the Bank are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies.  The risk-based capital standards that were applicable to the Company and the Bank through December 31, 2014 were based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I (“Basel I”), of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”).  However, in July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the “Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.  These rules went into effect for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components.
 
The Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 capital framework (known as “Basel III”) for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, compared to the previous U.S. Basel I risk-based capital rules.  The Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios and replace the Basel I risk-weighting approach, with a more risk-sensitive one, based in part, on the standardized approach set forth in “Basel II”.  The Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the Federal banking agencies’ rules.
 
The Capital Rules, among other things: (i) introduces as a capital measure “Common Equity Tier 1,” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified revised requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expands the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.  Under the Capital Rules, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules specific requirements.
 
Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2016 are as follows:
   
· | 4.5% CET1 to total risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to total risk-weighted assets; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 capital) to total risk-weighted assets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total adjusted quarterly average assets (known as “leverage ratio”) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Beginning in 2016, the Capital Rules required the Company and the Bank to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” composed entirely of CET1. When it is fully phased-in by the beginning of 2019, banking organizations will be required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (CET1 to Total risk-weighted assets), in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, to satisfy both the minimum risk-based capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, a banking organization will be required to maintain the following: (i) CET1 to total risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to total risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% by January 1, 2019, upon full phase-in of the capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions that do not maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% or more will face constraints on dividends, common share repurchases and incentive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under the general Basel I risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items included in shareholders’ equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items are not excluded; however, banks not using the advanced approach, including the Company and the Bank, were permitted to, and in the case of the Company and the Bank they did, make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items.
 
Consistent with the section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Capital Rules allow certain bank holding companies to include certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, in Tier 1 capital if they had less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 and the securities were issued before May 19, 2010.  Accordingly, the trust preferred securities on the Company’s balance sheet will be included as Tier 1 capital while they are outstanding, unless the Company completes an acquisition of a depository institution holding company that did not meet this criteria, or are acquired by such an organization, after January 1, 2014, at which time they would be subject to the stated phase-out requirements of the Capital Rules and would be included as Tier 2 capital.
 
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).
 
With respect to the Bank, the Capital Rules also revise the prompt corrective action (“PCA”) regulations established pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement for each capital category other than critically undercapitalized, with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each capital category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0%; and (iii) eliminating the current provision that allows certain highly-rated banking organizations to maintain a 3.0% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Capital Rules do not change the Total risk-based PCA capital requirement for any capital category.
 
The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighted-assets that expands the risk-weight categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the asset. The risk-weight categories generally range from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 1,250% for certain securitized exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. The standardized approach requires financial institutions to transition assets that are 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual from their original risk weight to 150 percent.  Additionally, loans designated as high volatility commercial real estate (“HVCRE”) are assigned a risk-weighting of 150 percent.
 
Requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company’s net income and return on equity. The current requirements and the Company’s actual capital levels are detailed in Note P of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” filed in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 
Consumer Protection Laws
 In connection with its banking activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy.  These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (“SAFE”), the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”), the Military Lending Act (“MLA”), and various state law counterparts.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws, including laws that apply to banks in order to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.  The CFPB has examination authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.  The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that are applicable to national banks and gives attorney generals for the states certain powers to enforce federal consumer protection laws.  Further, under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in any unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”).  A violation of the consumer protection and privacy laws, and in particular UDAAP, could have serious legal, financial, and reputational consequences.

In addition, the GLB Act requires all financial institutions to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties and establishes procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access.  In addition, the FCRA, as amended by the FACT Act, includes provisions affecting the Company, the Bank, and their affiliates, including provisions concerning obtaining consumer reports, furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies, maintaining a program to prevent identity theft, sharing of certain information among affiliated companies, and other provisions.  The FACT Act requires persons subject to FCRA to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit on terms less favorable than those generally available.  The FRB and the Federal Trade Commission have extensive rulemaking authority under the FACT Act, and the Company and the Bank are subject to the rules that have been created under the FACT Act, including rules regarding limitations on affiliate marketing and implementation of programs to identify, detect and mitigate certain identity theft red flags.  The SCRA protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service, and the MLA extends specific protections if an accountholder, at the time of account opening, is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof.  The SCRA applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty and limits the amount of interest, including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that are related to the obligation or liability.  The MLA applies to certain consumer loans and extends specific protections if an accountholder, at the time of account opening, is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof.  The Bank is also subject to data security standards and data breach notice requirements issued by the OCC and other regulatory agencies.  The Bank has created policies and procedures to comply with these consumer protection requirements.
 
The CFPB issued the final rules implementing the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage (QM) provisions of the Truth in Lending Act (the “QM Rule”).  The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower derived from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of “qualified mortgage” are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements.  The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced loans meeting the QM requirements.  The definition of a “qualified mortgage” incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet government-sponsored enterprises, Federal Housing Administration, and Veterans Administration underwriting guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits.  The Bank has created policies and procedures to comply with these consumer protection requirements.
 
USA Patriot Act
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”) imposes obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  In addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.  The USA Patriot Act also encourages information-sharing among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities by providing an exemption from the privacy provisions of the GLB Act for financial institutions that comply with the provision of the Act.  Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution.  The Company has approved policies and procedures that are designed to comply with the USA Patriot Act and its regulations.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others administrated by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).  The OFAC administered sanctions can take many different forms; however, they generally contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, entity or individual, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports and exports and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments, or providing investment related advice or assistance; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons).  Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.  Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, financial, and reputational consequences.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting reforms for companies that have securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established, among other things: (i) new requirements for audit and other key Board of Directors committees involving independence, expertise levels, and specified responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding the oversight of financial statements by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board for the accounting industry; (iv) new standards for auditors and the regulation of audits, including independence provisions which restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (v) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers including accelerated reporting of company stock transactions; (vi) a prohibition of personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non-preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulator requirements; and (vii) a range of new and increased civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws.
Electronic Fund Transfer Act
 Among other provisions, the federal banking rule under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions.  The rule does not govern overdraft fees on the payment of checks and certain other forms of bill payments.
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
 Under the CRA, the Bank is required to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Although the Bank must follow the requirements of CRA, it does not limit the Bank’s discretion to develop products and services that are suitable for a particular community or establish lending requirements or programs.  In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in lending practices.  The Bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company.  The Bank’s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions against it by its regulators as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.  The Bank’s latest CRA rating was “Satisfactory”.
The Bank Secrecy Act
 The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The BSA includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as currency transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements.  The Company has established a bank secrecy act /anti-money laundering program and taken other appropriate measures in order to comply with BSA requirements.
