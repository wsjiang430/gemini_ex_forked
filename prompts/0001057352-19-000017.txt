Item 1. | Business

In this report, the words “we,” “our,” “us,” “CoStar” or the “Company” refer to CoStar Group, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. This report also refers to our websites, but information contained on those sites is not part of this report.
CoStar Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, founded in 1987, is the number one provider of information, analytics and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the United States (“U.S.”) and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available; have the largest research department in the industry; own and operate leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings in the U.S. based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; and provide more information, analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors. We created and compiled our standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplace services where industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, including apartments, and the related business communities, can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information. Our service offerings span all commercial property types, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, commercial land, mixed-use and hospitality. We manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with our primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which includes the U.K., Spain, Germany and France.
Strategy
Our strategy is to provide industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate and apartments with critical knowledge to explore and complete transactions by offering the most comprehensive, timely and standardized information on commercial real estate and apartments and the right tools to be able to effectively utilize that information. Over time, we have expanded our services for commercial real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces in an effort to continue to meet the needs of the industry as it grows and evolves. 
Our standardized platform includes the most comprehensive proprietary database in the industry; the largest research department in the industry; proprietary data collection, information management and quality control systems; a large in-house product development team; a broad suite of web-based information, analytics and online marketplace services; a large team of analysts and economists; and a large, diverse base of clients. Our database has been developed and enhanced for more than 30 years by a research department that makes thousands of daily database updates. In addition to our internal efforts to grow the database, we have obtained and assimilated over 100 proprietary databases. Our comprehensive commercial real estate database powers our information services, sources data used in our analytic services and provides content for most of our online marketplace services. Our ability to utilize the same commercial real estate information across our standardized platform creates efficiencies in operations and improves data quality for our customers. 
We deliver our commercial real estate information content to our U.S. customers primarily via an integrated suite of online service offerings that includes information about space available for lease, comparable sales information, information about properties for sale, tenant information, Internet marketing services, analytical capabilities, information for clients’ websites, information about industry professionals and their business relationships, data integration and industry news. We also operate complementary online marketplaces for commercial real estate listings and apartment rentals. We strive to cross-sell our services to our customers in order to best suit their needs.
We have also extended our offering of comprehensive commercial real estate information geographically to include the U.K., Canada, Spain, Germany and France, through acquisitions and internal growth and development. Most recently, on October 12, 2018, we acquired Realla Ltd. ("Realla"), the operator of a commercial property listings and data management platform in the U.K., including a free-to-list search engine for commercial property listings. Information about CoStar’s revenues, long-lived assets and total assets derived from and located in, foreign countries is included in Notes 2, 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues; net income (loss) before interest and other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); and total assets and liabilities for each of our segments are set forth in Notes 3 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Information about risks associated with our foreign operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have five flagship brands - CoStar®, LoopNet®, Apartments.comTM, BizBuySell® and LandsofAmericaTM. Our subscription-based services consist primarily of information, analytics and online marketplace services offered over the Internet 
4

to the commercial real estate industry and related professionals. Our subscription-based information services consist primarily of CoStar Suite® services. CoStar Suite is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of CoStar Property Professional®, CoStar COMPS Professional® and CoStar Tenant®, accessible via the Internet and through our mobile applications, CoStar Mobile App and CoStar Go. CoStar Suite is our primary service offering in our North America and International operating segments. 
Our LoopNet subscription-based, online marketplace enables commercial property owners, landlords, and brokers working on their behalf to list properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. Commercial real estate agents, buyers and tenants use LoopNet extensively to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. 
 Apartments.comTM is part of our network of apartment marketing sites, which also includes ApartmentFinder.comTM, ForRent.com®, ApartmentHomeLiving.comTM, WestsideRentals.com®, AFTER55.com®, CorporateHousing.comTM, ForRentUniversity.com® and Apartamentos.comTM, our apartment-listing site offered exclusively in Spanish. Our apartment marketing network of subscription-based services offers renters a searchable database of apartment listings and provides professional property management companies and landlords with an advertising destination. Our apartment marketing network draws on and leverages CoStar’s multifamily database, which contains detailed information on apartment properties. Our apartment marketing sites are designed to meet renter preferences and demands, in order to drive traffic to those sites and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites. Our network of apartment marketing sites provide a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual availabilities and rents, and in-depth data on neighborhoods, including restaurants, nightlife, history, schools and other facts important to renters. To help renters find the information that meets their needs, the sites also offer innovative search tools such as the PolygonTM Search tool, which allows renters to specifically define the area in which they want to find an apartment. Apartments.com and Apartamentos.com also offer Plan Commute tools, which allow renters to search property listings that meet their transportation needs. We completed the acquisition of ForRent, a division of Dominion Enterprises, including the ForRent.com, AFTER55.com, CorporateHousing.com and ForRentUniversity.com apartment marketing sites on February 21, 2018. We also offer complementary services to the apartment industry, including tenant screening services, rental applications and payments processing and lease renewals. On November 8, 2018, we acquired Cozy Services, Ltd. ("Cozy"), a leading provider of online rental solutions that provides a broad spectrum of services to both landlords and tenants, including property listings, rent estimates, rental applications, tenant screening, online rent payments and expense tracking.

Our BizBuySell services, which include BizQuest®, provide an online marketplace for businesses for sale. Our LandsofAmerica services, which include LandAndFarm and LandWatch®, provide an online marketplace for rural lands for sale that is also accessible via our Land.com domain.
We also provide real estate and lease management solutions, including lease administration and abstraction services, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager service offerings, as well as, market research, consulting and analysis, portfolio and debt analysis, management and reporting capabilities through our CoStar Investment Analysis and CoStar Risk Analytics service offerings. We have created and are continually improving our standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplaces where members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information.
Our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription-based license agreements that renew automatically, a majority of which have a term of one year. Upon renewal, many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks. Depending on the type of service, contract rates are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client's business focus, geography, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis. 
Expansion and Growth
Acquisitions
We have continually expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information, analytics and online marketplace services. In addition to organic growth, we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions. On February 21, 2018, we completed the acquisition of ForRent, a division of Dominion Enterprises. ForRent’s primary service is digital advertising through a network of four multifamily websites, which includes ForRent.com, AFTER55.com, CorporateHousing.com and ForRentUniversity.com. On October 12, 2018, we acquired Realla Ltd., the operator of a commercial property listings and data management platform in the U.K., including a free-to-list search engine for commercial property listings. On November 8, 2018, we acquired Cozy, a leading provider in the U.S. of online rental solutions that provides a broad spectrum 
5

of services to both landlords and tenants, including property listings, rent estimates, rental applications, tenant screening, online rent payments, and expense tracking.
Development, Investments and Expansion
We are committed to supporting, improving and enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace solutions, including expanding and improving our offerings for property managers and renters. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services, and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations. 
We evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs. Further, in some cases, when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs, we may decide to combine, shift focus from, de-emphasize, phase out, or eliminate a service that, among other things, overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer. In the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings, we may experience reduced revenues and earnings. The decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services. However, we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings, if any, resulting from the elimination or phasing out of any service offering.
In 2018, we completed the integration of ForRent, including the ForRent sales team and the services offered by ForRent and have worked to maintain ForRent's relationships with its customers that existed prior to the acquisition. ForRent.com is expected to remain a distinct, complementary brand to Apartments.com, giving property managers and owners more exposure for their listings. 
We are also continuing to develop new, and improve existing, online rental property service offerings for the apartments industry. We plan to integrate the Cozy suite technology into the Aparments.com platform, creating an integrated online rental solution. In particular, we expect to implement the ability for renters to apply for leases online, for landlords to run tenant credit and background checks online and, eventually, for landlords and tenants to generate and enter into leases and to make and process payments online.
We are expanding the geographic reach of our services. We plan to integrate Realla with our CoStar UK operations, including development of a single point of data entry to allow our clients to display their commercial real estate listings through the CoStar Suite service offering and to make them visible to prospective tenants and investors through Realla’s marketing portal. 
We believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services, including expansion of our existing service offerings, have created a platform for long-term revenue growth. We expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscription-based services and the successful cross-selling of our services to customers in existing markets.
We have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company and our service offerings. We plan to continue to invest in, evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the Company continues to develop and grow. We also continue to invest in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to meet the growing content needs of our clients. While we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth, those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position. We introduced new enhancements on the CoStar homepage, including a Listing Manager feature that we believe will increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system.  Over time, we expect this feature will reduce the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information.
Industry Overview
The market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety, volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate. Each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements, and in order to facilitate transactions, industry participants must have extensive, accurate and current information and analysis. Members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability, properties for sale, rental units available, rental rates, vacancy rates, tenant movements, sales comparables, supply, new construction, absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively. Market research (including historical and forecast conditions) and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment. There is a strong need for an efficient marketplace, where commercial 
6

real estate professionals can exchange information, evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses, and interact with each other on a continuous basis.
A large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses, including:

• | Sales and leasing brokers | • | Government agencies 
• | Property owners | • | Mortgage-backed security issuers
• | Property managers | • | Appraisers 
• | Design and construction professionals | • | Pension fund managers 
• | Real estate developers | • | Reporters 
• | Real estate investment trust managers | • | Tenant vendors 
• | Investment bankers | • | Building services vendors 
• | Commercial bankers | • | Communications providers 
• | Mortgage bankers | • | Insurance companies’ managers 
• | Mortgage brokers | • | Institutional advisors 
• | Retailers | • | Investors and asset managers 

The commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace. Various organizations, including hundreds of brokerage firms, directory publishers and local research companies, collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered. This highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information, excessive internal cost and the creation of non-standardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness, resulting in a formidable information gap. 
The creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database, accurate and comprehensive research capabilities, experienced analysts, easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction. By combining our extensive database, researchers, our experienced team of analysts and economists, technological expertise and broad customer base, we believe that we have created such a platform.
The apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments and renters who are searching for their next home.  Property managers have several options at their disposal, including their own websites, drive-by and outdoor advertising, traditional classified ads, free online listing services and internet listings services (“ILS”), like Apartments.com and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate. Many apartment ILS websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise, resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter’s search criteria return either limited or no results, irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities. 
We believe that consumers expect accurate, actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information. Our apartment ILS websites include renter-focused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria (e.g., commute time to work); professional images of the properties, including immersive videos and 3-D interactive models; custom neighborhood profiles; and tenant reviews. Our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information. We proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ILS websites, including real time unit-level availability, current pricing, and rent specials. We have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users. Recent additions include: dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents, a reporting suite that provides customers with rent comparables, making rent trends information publicly available and free digital ad retargeting. We believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ILS websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual rental availabilities and rents, and in-depth data on neighborhoods.
CoStar’s Comprehensive Database
CoStar has spent more than 30 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information, which includes information on leasing, sales, comparable sales, tenants, and demand statistics, as well as digital images. This highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields, tracking such categories as location, site and zoning information, building characteristics, space and unit availability, tax assessments, ownership, sales and lease comparables, space requirements, number 
7

of retail stores, number of listings, mortgage and deed information, for-sale and for-lease listings, income and expense histories, tenant names, lease expirations, contact information, historical trends, demographic information and retail sales per square foot. The database also includes building photographs, aerial photographs, 3D virtual apartment tours, plat maps and floor plans.
CoStar Research
Research Department. Our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department. Our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through phone calls, e-mails and Internet updates, in addition to field inspections, public records review, news monitoring and direct mail. We have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites and have put in place an automated system that compiles information sourced from the Internet in order to provide the most up-to-date information on rental availabilities. 
Our researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information. As part of their update process, researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information. Because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry, many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers.
CoStar's field research effort includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new availabilities, find additional property inventory, photograph properties, collect tenant information, and verify existing information. CoStar's field research effort includes creating high quality videos of interior spaces (including walk-through videos and 3D virtual tours), amenities and exterior features of properties. CoStar utilizes high-tech, field research vehicles across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Spain and Germany. A significant majority of these vehicles are customized, energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers, Global Positioning System tracking software, high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to precisely measure buildings and geo-code and position them on digital maps. Each CoStar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data. A typical site inspection consists of photographing the building, measuring the building, geo-coding the building, capturing “For Sale” or “For Lease” sign information, counting parking spaces, assessing property condition and construction, and gathering tenant information. Field researchers also canvass properties, collecting tenant data suite by suite. We also utilize a low-flying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate. We place researchers on the low-flying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos. Our U.S. drone operators are Federal Aviation Administration certified and trained to capture aerial photographs and videos of commercial real estate. Our drone operators in the U.K. are certified and trained to Civil Aviation Authority standards with a permission for commercial operations pending.
Data and Image Providers. We license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third-party data sources. Licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information, including property ownership, tenant information, demographic information, maps, aerial photographs and 3D virtual apartment tours of apartment communities, all of which enhance various CoStar services. These license agreements generally grant us a non-exclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information, analytics and online marketplaces.
Management and Quality Control Systems. Our research processes include automated and non-automated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process. A large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors, including occupancy date conflicts, available square footage greater than building area, typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases. We also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology. Our non-automated quality control procedures include:

• | calling our information sources on recently updated properties to re-verify information;


• | performing periodic research audits and field checks to determine if we correctly canvassed buildings;


• | providing training and retraining to our research professionals to ensure accurate and standardized data compilation; and


• | compiling measurable performance metrics for research teams and managers for feedback on data quality.

Finally, one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day.

Clients
We draw clients from across the commercial real estate and related business community, including commercial real estate brokers, owners, developers, landlords, property managers, financial institutions, retailers, vendors, appraisers, investment banks, government agencies and other parties involved in commercial real estate. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our revenues.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are primarily located in field sales offices throughout the U.S. and in offices outside of the U.S., including, among others, Canada, London, England; Madrid, Spain; and Freiburg, Germany. Our inside sales teams are primarily located in our Washington, DC office. These teams prospect for new clients and perform product and service demonstrations exclusively by telephone and over the Internet to support the direct sales force.
Our local offices typically serve as the platform for our in-market sales, customer support and field research operations for their respective regions. The sales force is responsible for selling to new prospects, training new and existing clients, providing ongoing customer support, renewing existing client contracts and identifying cross-selling opportunities. In addition, the sales force has primary front line responsibility for customer care. Our customer service and support staff is charged with ensuring high client satisfaction by providing ongoing customer support. In 2016, we formed a customer relationship team consisting of client relationship managers in the sales organization, to drive even greater usage of our products and services. The client relationship managers are responsible for training existing users, sharing market specific research with clients, ensuring accurate and timely listings and ensuring client driven product enhancement ideas are shared with our product development team. 
Our sales strategy is to aggressively attract new clients, while providing ongoing incentives for existing clients to subscribe to additional products and services in order to achieve high renewal rates. We actively manage client accounts in order to retain clients by providing frequent service demonstrations as well as company-client contact and communication. In January 2018, we launched a two-week, 30-city road show to showcase CoStar's technologies to customers and prospective users. The presentations focused on how technological change is impacting the commercial real estate industry, including presentations on tools such as 3D cameras, infrared drones and augmented reality. We place a premium on training new and existing client personnel on the use of our services so as to promote maximum client utilization and satisfaction with our services. In the fall of 2018, we launched a customer service initiative across the U.K. to ensure client satisfaction with our product and to train customers on new features and services. Our sales strategy also involves entering into multi-year, multi-market license agreements with our larger clients. 
We seek to make our services essential to our clients’ businesses. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage. Contract rates for subscription-based services are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client’s business focus, geography, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties

a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis.
Our primary marketing methods include: service demonstrations; face-to-face networking; web-based marketing; direct marketing; communication via our corporate website and news services; participation in trade show and industry events; Company-sponsored events; print advertising in trade magazines and other business publications; client referrals; and CoStar TodayTM, LoopNewsTM and other company newsletters distributed via email to our clients and prospects. In 2017, we integrated the CoStar and LoopNet databases in order to enhance CoStar information services as information tools and LoopNet marketplace services as marketing tools. This integration provides clients the ability to enter listings into our Listing Manager tool, and to subsequently update their listings in CoStar and LoopNet simultaneously. To familiarize clients with the integration and benefits of the tool, we provided video tutorials and hosted numerous webinars, in addition to web-based marketing and direct marketing efforts. In 2018, over one hundred thousand commercial real estate professionals and other users successfully made millions of updates to their listings using Listing Manager.
 To generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network of rental websites, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign featuring television and radio ads, online and digital advertising impressions, social media, public relations, out-of-home and paid search marketing, all of which are reinforced with Search Engine Marketing efforts. We plan to continue to utilize these marketing methods and will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for our services for future periods.
Web-based marketing and direct marketing are effective means for us to find prospective clients. Our web-based marketing efforts include search engine optimization, paid advertising with major search engines, social media and display advertising on commercial real estate news and business websites and mobile applications, and our direct marketing efforts include television, radio, out-of-home ads, direct mail, email and telemarketing, and, when applicable, make extensive use of our unique, proprietary database. Once we have identified a prospective client, our most effective sales method is a service demonstration. We use various forms of advertising to build brand identity and reinforce the value and benefits of our services. We also sponsor and attend local association activities and events, including industry-leading events for commercial real estate brokers, owner/investors and retail and financial services institutions, and attend and/or exhibit at industry trade shows and conferences to reinforce our relationships with our core user groups. 
News has always been a valuable part of CoStar's core subscription offering. CoStar's news teams report on the latest deals and developments across our markets, keeping subscribers informed and driving higher usage in our core product. In 2018, we hired veteran journalists to guide our news efforts and expanded our team to deliver more robust coverage. We launched a daily newsletter for U.S. subscribers and delivered curated content to our largest markets. We plan to offer even more personalized information in 2019. In 2018, we also upgraded our technology to make our service more relevant for subscribers, giving us the capability to deliver specific news based on their individual preferences. 
We believe the ability to customize and personalize news for the user's specific interests should make our news service even more relevant and valuable to subscribers. In addition to encouraging more engagement through logins and time on site, we believe a more robust news operation will also provide more options and formats for advertising to the commercial real estate audience.
We currently offer dozens of webinars each year aimed at helping customers learn more about the commercial real estate industry and how to use our services. The webinars are available both as live presentations and as on-demand programs hosted on our website. On a monthly basis, we issue the CoStar Commercial Repeat Sales Index ("CCRSI"), a comprehensive set of benchmarks that investors and other market participants can use to better understand commercial real estate price movements. CCRSI is produced using our underlying data and is publicly distributed by CoStar through the news media and made available online.
Our sales and marketing efforts have focused and will continue to focus on cross-selling and marketing our services. We continue to develop and cross-sell the services offered by our Apartments.com network of rental websites and the other services we offer, including, but not limited to CoStar Suite. We will also continue to focus on identifying opportunities for customers to benefit from CoStar's Real Estate Manager offering.
Competition
The market for information, analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing. In the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries, we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are:
13


• | quality and depth of the underlying databases;


• | ease of use, flexibility and functionality of the software;


• | intuitiveness and appeal of the user interface;


• | timeliness of the data, including listings;


• | breadth of geographic coverage and services offered;


• | completeness and accuracy of content;


• | client service and support;


• | perception that the service offered is the industry standard;


• | price;


• | effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts;


• | proprietary nature of methodologies, databases and technical resources;


• | vendor reputation;


• | brand loyalty among customers; and


• | capital resources.

We compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies:

• | online marketing services, websites or data exchanges targeted to commercial real estate brokers, buyers and sellers of commercial real estate properties, insurance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, such as Reed Business Information Limited and its Estates Gazette and Radius Data Exchange products, RealMassive, officespace.com, 42floors, RealNex MarketPlace, TenantWise, www.propertyshark.com, Rofo, BuildingSearch.com, CIMLS, CompStak, Rightmove, CommercialCafe, CREXi, Truss, TotalCommercial.com and DebtX;


• | publishers and distributors of information, analytics and marketing services, including regional providers and national print publications, such as CBRE Economic Advisors, Marshall & Swift, Yale Robbins, REIS Network (part of the Moody's Analytics Accelerator), Real Capital Analytics, Real Capital Markets, Reonomy, The Smith Guide, Yardi Matrix, RealPage and its Axiometrics business and ReScour, Inc.;


• | Internet listing services featuring apartments for rent, such as ApartmentGuide.com, Rent.com, Rentals.com, Zillow Rentals, Trulia Rentals, StreetEasy, NakedApartments.com, HotPads.com, MyNewPlace.com, Zumper, PadMapper, Craigslist, ApartmentList.com, Move.com, Realtor.com, Adobo, RadPad, RentJungle and RentCafe.com;


• | locally controlled real estate boards, exchanges or associations sponsoring property listing services and the companies with whom they partner, such as Catylist, the National Association of Realtors, CCIM Institute, Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, the Commercial Association of Realtors Data Services and AIR CRE; 


• | real estate portfolio management software solutions, such as Cougar Software, MRI Software, Altus, Intuit and SiteCompli;


• | real estate lease management and administration software solutions, such as Accruent, Tririga, Manhattan Software, Lucemex and AMT;


• | in-house research departments operated by commercial real estate brokers; and


• | public record providers.

As the market for information, analytics and online marketplaces develops, additional competitors (including companies which could have greater access to data, financial, product development, technical, analytic or marketing resources than we do) may enter the market and competition may intensify. For example, a company like Bloomberg L.P. has the resources, and has previously announced an intention, to move into the commercial real estate information business. Further, a company like Google, which has a far-reaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities, could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena. A company like Zillow, which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry, could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among Internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners. While we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors, current or future competitors could materially harm our business.

Proprietary Rights
To protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, database, software, trademarks and other intellectual property, we depend upon a combination of:

• | trade secret, misappropriation, unfair competition, copyright, trademark, computer fraud, database protection and other laws;


• | registration of copyrights and trademarks;


• | nondisclosure, noncompetition and other contractual provisions with employees and consultants;


• | license agreements with customers;


• | patent protection; and


• | technical measures.

We seek to protect our software’s source code, our database and our photography as trade secrets and under copyright law. Although copyright registration is not a prerequisite for copyright protection, we have filed for copyright registration for many of our databases, photographs, software and other materials. Under current U.S. copyright law, the arrangement and selection of data may be protected, but the actual data itself may not be. Certain U.K. database protection laws provide additional protections for our U.K. databases. We license our services under license agreements that grant our clients non-exclusive, non-transferable rights. These agreements restrict the disclosure and use of our information and prohibit the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of any of our proprietary information, methodologies or analytics.
We also attempt to protect our proprietary databases, our trade secrets and our proprietary information through confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our employees and consultants. Our services also include technical measures designed to detect, discourage and prevent unauthorized access to and/or copying of our intellectual property. We have established an internal antipiracy team that uses fraud-detection technology to continually monitor use of our services to detect and prevent unauthorized access, and we actively prosecute individuals and firms that engage in this unlawful activity.
We maintain U.S. and international trademark registrations for CoStar’s core service names and proactively file U.S. and international trademark applications covering our new and planned service names. Our federally registered trademarks include CoStar®, CoStar Property®, CoStar COMPS Professional®, CoStar Tenant®, CoStar Go, CoStar Lease Analysis®, CoStar Showcase® and LoopNet®, among many others. In the U.S., trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and have not been found to be generic. We consider our trademarks in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset. In addition, we maintain a patent portfolio that protects certain of our systems and methodologies. We currently have one granted patent in the U.K., which expires in 2021, covering, among other things, certain of our field research methodologies, two patents in Canada, which expire in 2021, covering, among other things, certain features of our field research methodologies, and twelve patents in the U.S. which expire in 2020, 2021 (2 patents), 2022 (2 patents), 2025, 2032, 2036, and 2037 (4 patents), respectively, covering, among other things, certain features of our field research technology and mapping tools. We regard the rights protected by our patents as valuable to our business, but do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent or on our portfolio of patents as a whole.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we employed 3,705 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are excellent. In common with many German companies, employees in our German subsidiary, Thomas Daily GmbH, have elected five fellow employees to form a Works Council, which represents our employees at the location and has certain rights to receive information from us and engage us in discussions under applicable law.
