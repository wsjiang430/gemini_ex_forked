Item 1.  Business.
General Development and Description of Business
AAON, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“AAON Nevada”) was incorporated on August 18, 1987. Our operating subsidiaries include AAON, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, and AAON Coil Products, Inc., a Texas corporation. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to “AAON”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or “ours” refer to AAON Nevada and our subsidiaries.
We are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, marketing and sale of air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom and custom rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps and coils.
Products and Markets
Our products serve the commercial and industrial new construction and replacement markets. To date, our sales have been primarily to the domestic market. Foreign sales accounted for approximately $14.7 million, $14.6 million, and $14.7 million of our sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As a percent of sales, foreign sales accounted for approximately 3% to 4% of our net sales in each of those years.
Our rooftop and condensing unit markets primarily consist of units installed on commercial or industrial structures of generally less than ten stories in height. Our air handling units, self-contained units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms and coils are suitable for all sizes of commercial and industrial buildings.
The size of these markets is determined primarily by the number of commercial and industrial building completions. The replacement market consists of products installed to replace existing units/components that are worn or damaged. Currently, over half of the industry’s market consists of replacement units.
The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market.
Based on our 2018 sales of $433.9 million, we estimate that we have approximately a 11% share of the greater than five ton rooftop market and a 2% share of the less than five ton market. During 2018, approximately 50% of our sales were generated from the renovation and replacement markets and 50% from new construction. The percentage of sales for new construction vs. replacement to particular customers is related to the customer’s stage of development.

We purchase certain components, fabricate sheet metal and tubing and then assemble and test the finished products. Our primary finished products consist of a single unit system containing heating and cooling in a self-contained cabinet, referred to in the industry as “unitary products”. Our other finished products are chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, coils, air handling units, condensing units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, rooftop units and geothermal/ water-source heat pumps. 
We offer four groups of rooftop units: the RQ Series, consisting of five cooling sizes ranging from two to six tons; the RN Series, offered in 28 cooling sizes ranging from six to 140 tons; the RL Series, which is offered in 21 cooling sizes ranging from 45 to 240 tons; and the RZ Series, which is offered in 11 cooling sizes ranging from 55 to 240 tons.  
We also offer the SA, SB and M2 Series as indoor packaged, water-cooled or geothermal/water-source heat pump self-contained units with cooling capacities of three to 70 tons.
Our small packaged geothermal/water-source heat pump units consist of the WH Series horizontal configuration and WV Series vertical configuration, both from one-half to 30 tons.
We manufacture a LF Series air-cooled chiller, a LN Series air-cooled chiller, and a LZ Series chiller and packaged outdoor mechanical room, which are available in both air-cooled condensing and evaporative-condensed configurations, covering a range of four to 540 tons. BL Series boiler outdoor mechanical rooms are also available with 400-6,000 MBH heating capacity. FZ Series fluid cooler outdoor mechanical rooms are also available with a range of 50 to 450 tons. 
We offer four groups of condensing units: the CB Series, two to five tons; the CF Series, two to 70 tons; the CN Series, 55 to 140 tons; and the CL Series, 45 to 230 tons.
Our air handling units consist of the indoor F1, H3 and V3 Series and the modular M2 and M3 Series, as well as air handling unit configurations of the RQ, RN, RL, RZ and SA Series units. 
Our energy recovery option applicable to our RQ, RN, RL, RZ and SB units, as well as our H3, V3, M2 and M3 Series air handling units, responds to the U.S. Clean Air Act mandate to increase fresh air in commercial structures. Our products are designed to compete on the higher quality end of standardized products.
Our air-cooled chillers (LF, LN and LZ Series) are certified with the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (“AHRI”) in accordance with AHRI Standard 550/590. Our water-source heat pump products, including RN, RQ, M2, SB, WH and WV Series, are AHRI certified in accordance with ANSI/AHRI/ASHRAE/ISO 13256.
Performance characteristics of our products range in cooling capacity from one-half to 540 tons and in heating capacity from 7,200 to 9,000,000 BTUs. All of our products meet the Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) minimum efficiency standards, which define the maximum amount of energy to be used in producing a given amount of cooling. Many of our units far exceed these minimum standards and are among the highest efficiency units currently available.
A typical commercial building installation requires one ton of air conditioning for every 300-400 square feet or, for a 100,000 square foot building, 250 tons of air conditioning, which can involve multiple units.
We also offer six control options: the Pioneer Silver, Pioneer Gold, Touchscreen Controller, Orion Controller, terminal block for field installed controls, and factory installed customer provided controls. 
Major Customers
One customer, Texas AirSystems, accounted for 10% or more of our sales during 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
2

The most important materials we purchase are steel, copper and aluminum, which are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from other domestic manufacturers certain components, including compressors, electric motors and electrical controls used in our products. We attempt to obtain the lowest possible cost in our purchases of raw materials and components, consistent with meeting specified quality standards. We are not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or the major components of our manufactured products. By having multiple suppliers, we believe that we will have adequate sources of supplies to meet our manufacturing requirements for the foreseeable future.
We attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-cancellable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations.
We have not been significantly impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) that contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals”, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. 
Representatives
We employ a sales staff of 41 individuals and utilize approximately 63 independent manufacturer representatives’ organizations (“Representatives”) having 101 offices to market our products in the United States and Canada. We also have one international sales organization, which utilizes 19 distributors in other countries. Sales are made directly to the contractor or end user, with shipments being made from our Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Longview, Texas, plants and our Parkville, Missouri, facility to the job site.
Our products and sales strategy focuses on niche markets. The targeted markets for our equipment are customers seeking products of better quality than offered, and/or options not offered, by standardized manufacturers.
To support and service our customers and the ultimate consumer, we provide parts availability through our sales offices. We also have factory service organizations at each of our plants. Additionally, a number of the Representatives we utilize have their own service organizations, which, in connection with us, provide the necessary warranty work and/or normal service to customers. 
Warranties
Our product warranty policy is:  the earlier of one year from the date of first use or 18 months from date of shipment for parts only; an additional four years for compressors (if applicable); 15 years on aluminized steel gas-fired heat exchangers (if applicable); 25 years on stainless steel heat exchangers (if applicable); and ten years on gas-fired heat exchangers in RL products (if applicable). Our warranty policy for the RQ series covers parts for two years from date of unit shipment. Our warranty policy for the WH and WV Series geothermal/water-source heat pumps covers parts for five years from the date of manufacture.
The Company also sells extended warranties on parts for various lengths of time ranging from six months to ten years. Revenue for these separately priced warranties is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the separately priced warranty period.
Research and Development
Our products are engineered for performance, flexibility and serviceability. This has become a critical factor in competing in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) equipment industry. We must continually develop new and improved products in order to compete effectively and to meet evolving regulatory standards in all of our major product lines.
All of our Research and Development (“R&D”) activities are self-sponsored, rather than customer-sponsored. R&D activities have involved the RQ, RN, RL and RZ (rooftop units), F1, H3, SA, V3, M2 and M3 (air handling units), LF, LN and LZ (chillers), CB, CF, CN and CL (condensing units), SA and SB (self-contained units), WH and WV (water-source heat pumps), FZ (fluid coolers) and BL (boilers), as well as component evaluation and refinement, development of control systems and new product development. We incurred R&D expenses of approximately $13.5 million, $13.0 million, and $12 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Our Norm Asbjornson Innovation Center ("NAIC") research and development laboratory facility that open in 2019, includes many unique capabilities that exist nowhere else in the world. A few features of the lab include supply, return, and outside sound testing at actual load conditions, testing up to a 300 ton air conditioning system, testing of up to a 540 ton chiller system, and 80 million Btu/h of gas heating test capacity. Environmental application testing capabilities include -20 to 140°F testing conditions, up to 8 inches per hour rain testing, up to 2 inches per hour snow testing, and up to 50 mph wind testing. We have the largest sound-testing chamber in the world for testing heating and air conditioning equipment, and the only one that can do this testing while putting the equipment under full environmental load. This will enable AAON to lead the industry in the development of quiet, energy efficient commercial and industrial heating and air conditioning equipment. 
Ten testing chambers within the NAIC allow AAON to meet and maintain AHRI (Air-Conditioning Heating and Refrigeration Institute) and DOE certification, and solidify the company’s industry position as a technological leader in the manufacturing of HVAC equipment. Current voluntary industry certification programs and government regulations only go to 63 tons of air conditioning as that is the largest environmental chamber currently available for testing.  The NAIC contain contains both a 100 ton and a 540 ton chamber allowing us to prove to customers our capacity and efficiency on these larger units.  
The NAIC was designed to test units well beyond the standard AHRI rating points and we offer testing services on AAON equipment throughout its range of application.  This is very important on critical facilities where the units must perform properly and there is great risk in waiting to see once installed. These same capabilities will enable AAON to develop new extended range of operation equipment and prove its capabilities.
Backlog
Our backlog as of February 1, 2019 was approximately $147.0 million compared to approximately $64.9 million as of February 1, 2018. The current backlog consists of orders considered by management to be firm and our goal is to fill orders within approximately 60 to 90 days after an order is deemed to become firm; however, the orders are subject to cancellation by the customers in which case, cancellation charges apply up to the full price of the equipment.
Working Capital Practices
Working capital practices in the industry center on inventories and accounts receivable. Our management regularly reviews our working capital with a view of maintaining the lowest level consistent with requirements of anticipated levels of operation. Our greatest needs arise during the months of July - November, the peak season for inventory (primarily purchased material) and accounts receivable. Our working capital requirements are generally met by cash flow from operations and a bank revolving credit facility, which currently permits borrowings up to $30 million and had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018. We believe that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future.
Seasonality
Sales of our products are moderately seasonal with the peak period being July - November of each year due to timing of construction projects being directly related to warmer weather.
Competition
In the standardized market, we compete primarily with Lennox International, Inc., Trane (Ingersoll Rand Limited), York (Johnson Controls Inc.) and Carrier (United Technologies Corporation). All of these competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than we do. Our products compete on the basis of total value, quality, function, serviceability, efficiency, availability of product, reliability, product line recognition and acceptability of sales outlets. However, in new construction where the contractor is the purchasing decision maker, we are often at a competitive disadvantage because of the emphasis placed on initial cost. In the replacement market and other owner-controlled purchases, we have a better chance of getting business since quality and long-term cost are generally taken into account.

Employees
As of February 5, 2019, we employed 2,221 direct employees and contract personnel. Our employees are not represented by unions. Management considers its relations with our employees to be good.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Concessions
We do not consider any patents, trademarks, licenses or concessions to be material to our business operations, other than patents issued regarding our energy recovery wheel option, blower, gas-fired heat exchanger, evaporative-cooled condenser de-superheater and low leakage damper which have terms of 20 years with expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2033. 
Environmental Matters
Laws concerning the environment that affect or could affect our operations include, among others, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, regulations promulgated under these Acts, and any other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters.  We believe that we are in compliance with these laws and that future compliance will not materially affect our earnings or competitive position.
We also strive to protect the environment, work with suppliers who do the same, and encompass sustainable business practices in our manufacturing operations. AAON is dedicated to leading the company into a bright sustainable future. We have joined Sustainable Tulsa, a local non-profit organization, in creating an AAON Scor3card to implement more sustainable processes throughout all the company locations (Tulsa, Longview and Parkville). We recognize that sustainability is both profitable and economical.
Since 2014, we have changed out our lighting to a much more energy efficient system. 80% of our lighting was Metal Halide and 20% was fluorescent. Currently, we are about 80-90% LED, and 10-20% fluorescent. We will be 100% LED by 2020. When you combine the LED upgrade with our advanced lighting control system, AAON saves about $400,000/year on electricity. We have also received a similar amount from power company rebates. These power savings equate to about 5,000,000 kWh saved per year. The LED lighting has also created a better work environment for our employees and requires less maintenance.
In addition to this, we have installed more energy efficient HVAC systems, air compressors, and building insulation.
At the Tulsa facility currently paper and metal recycling are being conducted. Numerous waste streams have been identified by our internal GoGreen employee committee that could be recycled, reused, or reduced. We are also implementing a program to sort all our metals that has been identified to produce more profits. At the Longview facility currently metal, cardboard, and wood recycling is being conducted. The metal recycling also includes sorting all metals for maximum rebates. At the Parkville, facility recycling efforts are currently being researched and pursued. We recover oil in our sheet metal manufacturing area, which is then recycled. The rags are washed and returned to us be used again, preventing them from entering a landfill.
AAON is also committed to designing and manufacturing innovative HVAC products of the highest quality, efficiency, and performance. Our water-source heat pumps products recover otherwise wasted energy and employ it to cool, heat, and provide dehumidification to a building - making it one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly systems. AAON packaged rooftop units with two stage compressors are optimized with high efficiency evaporator and condenser coils, and variable speed fans leading to an AHRI Certified performance up to 19.15 SEER and 20.2 IEER. AAON H3/V3 Series energy recovery wheel air handling units provide energy efficient 100% outside air ventilation, by recovering energy that would otherwise be exhausted from a building. LZ Series packaged outdoor mechanical rooms are engineered to maximize the efficiency of the complete hydronic system - compressors, condenser, and evaporator. Factory installed 98% efficiency boilers with pumping packages available for applications that require hot water. Energy saving waterside economizers are available for chilled water systems that require cooling at low ambient conditions.
