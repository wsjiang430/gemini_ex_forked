ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 TriLinc Global Impact Fund, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed on April 30, 2012. Unless otherwise noted, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and “our Company” refer to TriLinc Global Impact Fund, LLC; the term our “Advisor” and “TriLinc Advisors” refers to TriLinc Advisors, LLC, our external advisor; the term “SC Distributors” and our “dealer manager” refers to SC Distributors, LLC, our dealer manager; and the term our “Sponsor” refers to TriLinc Global, LLC, our sponsor. 
 Overview 
 The Company makes impact investments in Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs, which we define as those businesses having less than 500 employees, primarily in developing economies that provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. To a lesser extent, we may also make impact investments in companies that may not meet our technical definition of SMEs due to a larger number of employees but that also provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. We generally expect that such investments will have similar investment characteristics as SMEs as defined by us. We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company on April 30, 2012. We believe that we operate and intend to operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We invest in SMEs through local market sub-advisors and our objective is to build a diversified portfolio of financial assets, including direct loans, loan participations, convertible debt instruments, trade finance, structured credit and preferred and common equity investments. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our assets will continue to consist of collateralized private debt instruments, which we believe offer opportunities for competitive risk-adjusted returns through income generation. We are externally managed and advised by TriLinc Advisors. 
 To assist the Company in achieving its investment objective, the Company makes investments via wholly owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has 13 subsidiaries, all of which are Cayman Islands exempted companies. To assist the Advisor in managing the Company and its subsidiaries, the Advisor may provide services via TriLinc Advisors International, Ltd. (“TAI”), a Cayman Islands exempted company that is wholly owned by TriLinc Advisors, LLC. 
 Our business strategy is to generate competitive financial returns and positive economic, social and/or environmental impact by providing financing to SMEs, primarily in developing economies, defined as countries with national income classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income and below. Our style of investment is referred to as impact investing, which J.P. Morgan Global Research and Rockefeller Foundation in a 2010 report called “an emerging alternative asset class” and defined as investing with the intent to create positive impact beyond financial return. We believe it is possible to generate competitive financial returns while creating positive, measurable impact. Through our investments in SMEs, we intend to enable job creation and stimulate economic growth. 
 Our investment objectives are to provide our unitholders current income, capital preservation and modest capital appreciation. These objectives are achieved primarily through SME trade finance and term loan financing, while employing rigorous risk mitigation and due diligence practices, and transparently measuring and reporting the economic, social and environmental impacts of our investments. The majority of our investments are senior secured trade finance, senior secured loans, and other collateralized loans or loan participations to SMEs with established, profitable businesses in developing economies. With our sub-advisors, we expect to provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from $5-20 million per transaction for direct SME loans and $500,000 to $15 million for trade finance transactions. We seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets which have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing best practices in our due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 
 Our goal is to create a diversified portfolio of primarily private debt instruments, including trade finance and term loans, whose counterparties are small and medium-size businesses in developing economies. Private debt facilities generate current income and in some cases offer the potential for modest capital appreciation, while maintaining a higher place in a company’s capital structure than the equity held by the owners and other investors.  As small and growing businesses, our borrowers have used and we expect them to continue to use capital to expand operations, improve the financial standing of their operations, or finance the trade of their goods. According to the most recent IFC SME Banking Guide, SMEs have been shown to improve job creation and GDP growth throughout the world, and we expect the portfolio of our investments to have a positive, measurable impact in their communities, in addition to offering a competitive financial return to the investor. 
 On February 25, 2013, our registration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC. Pursuant to the registration statement, we commenced our initial public offering of up to $1.5 billion in units of our limited liability company interest, consisting of up to $1.25 billion of units in our primary offering, consisting of Class A units and Class C units at the initial offering prices of $10.00 per unit and $9.576 per unit, respectively, and Class I units at $9.025 per unit, which we refer to as the primary offering, and up to $250 million of units pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, which we refer to as the Distribution Reinvestment Plan,

and which we collectively refer to as the Offering. In May 2012, the Advisor purchased 22,161 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of $200,000. In June 2013, we satisfied our minimum offering requirement of $2,000,000 when the Sponsor purchased 321,330 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,900,000 and we commenced operations. The Offering terminated on March 31, 2017. Through the termination of the Offering, we raised approximately $361,776,000 in gross proceeds, including approximately $13,338,000 raised through the Distribution Reinvestment Plan.
Upon termination of the Offering, we registered $75 million in Class A, Class C and Class I units to continue to be offered pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan to the investors who have purchased units in the Offering. On March 7, 2018, our board of managers approved an amendment to our distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which, commencing with distributions declared for the month of March 2018, units issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan are being offered at the price equal to the net asset value per unit of each class of units, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC at the time of reinvestment. Prior to March 30, 2018, units were issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan at a price equal to the greater of $9.025 per unit or the net asset value per unit of each class, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC. 
 For the period from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, we issued 971,564 of our units pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan for gross proceeds of approximately $8,762,000. In addition, for the period from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, we issued 1,654,871 of our units for gross proceeds of approximately $14,204,000 pursuant to a private placement to accredited investors. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 1,175,826 of our units pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan for gross proceeds of approximately $10,028,000. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 6,240,356 of our units for gross proceeds of approximately $53,117,000 pursuant to a private placement.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had issued an aggregate of 47,737,792 of our units, including 3,625,121 units issued under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan, for gross proceeds of approximately $447,887,000 including approximately $32,128,000 reinvested under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (before dealer manager fees of approximately $4,786,000 and selling commissions of $16,924,000, for net proceeds of $426,177,000).
 Our Dealer Manager 
 SC Distributors, LLC, or SC Distributors, a Delaware limited liability company formed in March 2009, served as our dealer manager for the Offering. Strategic Capital Advisory Services, LLC, or Strategic Capital, is an affiliate of SC Distributors and has an equity interest in our Advisor. SC Distributors is a member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. SC Distributors received dealer manager fees and selling commissions, and receives distribution fees and other ongoing fees with respect to certain classes of units sold while SC Distributors was the dealer manager. In addition, SC Distributors received certain reimbursements for services relating to our Offering.
Our Advisor 
 TriLinc Advisors manages our investments. TriLinc Advisors is a private investment advisory firm focusing on impact investments in SMEs around the world. TriLinc Advisors is a registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. Led by its Chief Executive Officer and President, Gloria Nelund, its  Chief Financial Officer, Mark Tipton, its Chief Operating Officer, Scott Hall, its Chief Compliance Officer, Brent VanNorman, and its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Sanford, TriLinc Advisors’ management team has a long track record and broad experience in the management of regulated, multi-billion dollar fund complexes and global macro portfolio management. TriLinc Advisors and our sub-advisors have an extensive network of relationships with emerging market private equity and debt managers, bilateral and multilateral Development Financial Institutions, or DFIs, and international consultancies and service providers that we believe benefit our portfolio of investments. We benefit from both the top-down, global macro investing approach of TriLinc Advisors and the bottom-up deal sourcing and structuring of our sub-advisors. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement and its ownership in TriLinc Advisors, Strategic Capital is entitled to receive distributions equal to 15% of the gross cash proceeds received by TriLinc Advisors from the management and incentive fees payable by us to TriLinc Advisors under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of February 25, 2014, by and between the Company and the Advisor, as renewed through February 25, 2020 (the “Advisory Agreement”). See “Investment Advisory Agreements and Fees” section below. 
 We seek to capitalize on the significant investment experience of our Advisor’s management team, which has over 100 years of collective experience in financial services and investment. Our CEO and President, Gloria Nelund, founded our Sponsor in 2008 after a thirty year career in the international asset management industry. 
 As of the date of this report, we have engaged, through our Advisor, eleven third-party investment managers in a sub-advisory capacity to source, evaluate, and monitor investments. As noted below, we have determined not to make any additional investments sourced by one of the eleven sub-advisors. Our local market sub-advisors have significant experience and established networks in our targeted asset classes, regions and countries, and adhere to the investment parameters as directed by the Advisor’s investment team and our board of managers. Primary sub-advisors, who will source the majority of our investments, must have a minimum five year 
 5


investment track record and have invested at least $250 million in their target region. Secondary sub-advisors, who focus on a specific region or asset class, must have a minimum three year investment track record and have invested at least $100 million in their target region. All sub-advisors must have continuity in their investment team, including senior management, and an investment strategy that can responsibly deploy appropriate levels of capital. Sub-advisors must have strong, independent risk controls and must screen for and track impact and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices of the borrowers. 
 TriLinc Advisors has contracted the following third-party investment managers to act as sub-advisors:

• | CEECAT Capital Limited & CCL Investments SARL (collectively “CCL Capital” or “CCL Investments”): established in 2014, CCL Capital is a European-focused spin-off of ADM Capital group (“ADM Capital”), which has specialized in recovery, special situations and stressed opportunities across Asia since 1998, and in the Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Turkey (“CEECAT”) region since 2005. CCL Capital manages all of ADM Capital’s legacy assets in the CEECAT region and focuses on extending private credit to SMEs who cannot access regular bank financing due to factors such as local regulatory restrictions on bank lending, illiquidity or stress in the banking sector, delays in the bank approval process, collateral coverage mismatch for local banks, among others. CCL Capital’s principals have 42 years of combined experience in corporate and structured finance, cash equity sales and equity derivative sales, including past tenures at Merrill Lynch, DEG, The World Bank, IFC, KPMG Transaction Services, and Allen & Overy, and have completed a total of ~$299 million (equivalent to €255 million) in debt investment deals across the CEECAT region. CCL Capital has a demonstrated track record in establishing, operating, managing and advising funds that invest in companies across the region through utilizing their strong cultural knowledge of the local legal jurisdictions and regulatory compliance requirements. CCL Capital seeks to provide term loans to borrower companies primarily operating in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Following the 2008 financial crisis, SMEs have found it challenging to source capital in the CEECAT region given the dominance of foreign-owned banks in the local markets and the consequent withdrawal of capital once the financial crisis hit. The SME sector represents 90% of all corporations in the region and is a major source of employment, production and income tax. SMEs possess a number of constraints when seeking growth capital, including insufficient access to capital markets, lack of financial management, insufficient equity capital, and difficulty in accessing bank finance. With scarce access to capital, CCL Capital is able to scale this market by being one of the few private debt providers targeting SMEs in this region. CCL Capital differentiates itself from traditional bank lenders by structuring its facilities to focus on improving corporate governance by working closely with the borrower’s management team to improve the finance functions of the borrower company, such as accounting transparency, better financial planning, and cash flow management. CCL Capital implements improvements in the areas of operations, strategy, and environmental and social practices for its borrowers. The directors appointed by CCL Capital are expected to strengthen the borrower’s corporate governance through active participation and by establishing the functions and operations of the board. Critical environmental and social roadmaps are identified during the due diligence phase with the help of third party consultants, who are often employed by CCL Capital to further counsel and monitor the implementation of post investment action plans and management systems against the IFC Performance Standards. Since capital is scarce for SMEs in Emerging Europe, CCL Capital believes that the ultimate goal of their facilities is to see their investee companies access the formal banking sector by demonstrating strong financial ratios, improved governance, and a track record of responsible financial management. CCL Capital serves as a secondary sub-advisor.

IIG is the sub-advisor with respect to six of the twelve investments that we have deemed Watch List investments, which are investments with respect to which we have determined there have been significant changes in the credit and collection risk of the investment. We have determined not to engage in any new business with IIG due in part to IIG’s failure to provide us with complete and accurate information with respect to our investments for which IIG is the sub-advisor, the misapplication of $6 million that we had invested in 2017 and the failure to return our funds that were misapplied.

• | A rigorous multi-level risk mitigation strategy at the portfolio level through “extreme” diversification, the sub-advisor level through rigorous due diligence and oversight, and the investment level through local market knowledge and credit expertise of our sub-advisors
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equity warrants and discounted trade receivables
--+-------------------------------------------------

 The majority of our investments have been and will continue to be senior secured trade finance, senior secured loans and other collateralized loans or loan participations to SMEs with established, profitable businesses in developing economies. With our sub-advisors, we provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from $5-20 million per transaction for direct SME loans and $500,000 to $15 million for trade finance transactions. We seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets who have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing sound due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis.
 Investments have been and will continue to be primarily credit facilities to developing economy SMEs, including trade finance and SME term loans, through TriLinc Advisors’ team of professional sub-advisors with a local presence in the markets where they invest. We typically provide financing that is collateralized, has a short to medium-term maturity and is self-liquidating through the repayment of principal. By providing additional liquidity to growing small businesses, we believe we will support both economic growth and the expansion of the global middle class.

1    In prior periods, the Company has used Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for purposes of presentation of its investments in publicly filed and other offering documents. There are several industry classification systems widely used by the investment industry and there is no specific industry classification system the Company is required to use either internally or in its public materials. The Company believes that the traditional industrial classification systems, including SIC codes, do not accurately reflect the sustainable nature of certain of the Company’s investments and, in some cases, may be misleading. Therefore, starting with the quarter ending December 31, 2017, the Company has determined to use a Company created industry classification system for presentation of its investments, which the Company believes will be more appropriate in light of the sustainable nature of the Company’s investments.
 2  Trade finance borrowers may be granted flexibility with respect to repayment relative to the stated maturity date to accommodate specific contracts and/or business cycle characteristics. This flexibility in each case is agreed upon between the Company and the sub-advisor and between the sub-advisor and the borrower.

 Measuring Impact 
 We measure and expect to regularly provide accounting of economic, social and/or environmental impact achieved through our investments. The Company’s impact measurement system is utilized with investments to evaluate the progress of borrower companies toward their impact objectives during the life of the investment. The system leverages technology that has been specifically developed for tracking and analyzing impact and includes full integration of the Global Impact Investing Network’s Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (“IRIS”) metrics. Impact measurement is accomplished through the establishment of initial baseline measurements for both the Company core economic development metrics, as well as metrics associated with borrower companies’ stated impact objectives. These baseline measurements will be compared against future measurements in order to track incremental progress. In addition to furthering the Company’s economic development impact objectives, we anticipate that our investments will have a positive effect on borrower companies’ ability to make progress toward their stated impact objectives(s).

On an annual basis, an updating assessment is completed. This includes collection of our core impact metrics and borrower company impact objective-specific metrics. Annual external assurance of impact metrics data will be completed by an independent, third party provider. In February 2015, we engaged Moss Adams LLP, with the approval of our Audit Committee, to perform an independent review of certain impact data which will be reported once the Company reaches a statistically significant sample of borrower companies that have been in our portfolio for at least one year. In February 2018, the Company issued its second Sustainability and Impact Report as of June 30, 2017.
 Financing Strategy 
 We may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our unitholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings from either commercial financial institutions or DFIs. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our investment strategy and portfolio composition. In determining whether to borrow money, we will seek to optimize maturity, covenant packages and rate structures. Most importantly, the risks of borrowing within the context of our investment outlook and the impact on our investment portfolio will be extensively analyzed in making this determination. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had borrowings amounting to $32,875,000 and $28,160,000, respectively. If we are not able to obtain additional financings, our returns are expected to be lower than originally anticipated when we were formed.
Hedging Activities 
 Most of our investments are anticipated to continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars, but when exposed to foreign currencies, we will seek to hedge the exposure when prudent and cost-effective. These hedging activities may include the use of derivatives, swaps, or other financial products to hedge our interest rate or currency risk. At December 31, 2018, we only had one investment, amounting to approximately $8 million, which was not denominated in U.S. Dollars and we had not entered into any hedging transactions.  At December 31, 2017, all our investments were denominated in U.S. Dollars and, accordingly, we had not entered into any hedging transactions. 
Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement 
 On March 26, 2018, the Company, Advisor and the Sponsor entered into an Amended and Restated Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement (“Responsibility Agreement”) originally effective as of June 11, 2013 and covering expenses through December 31, 2017. Since the inception of the Company through December 31, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Responsibility Agreement, the Sponsor has paid approximately $12,420,600 of operating expenses, asset management fees, and incentive fees on behalf of the Company and will reimburse the Company for an additional $4,240,200 of expenses, which have been paid by the Company as of December 31, 2017. 
 The Sponsor will only be entitled to reimbursement of the cumulative expenses it has incurred on the Company’s behalf to the extent the Company’s investment income in any quarter, as reflected on the statement of operations, exceeds the sum of (a) total distributions to unitholders incurred during the quarter and (b) the Company’s expenses as reflected on the statement of operations for the same quarter (the “Reimbursement Hurdle”). If the Sponsor is entitled to receive reimbursement for any given quarter because the Company’s investment income exceeds the Reimbursement Hurdle for such quarter, we will apply the excess amount (the “Excess Amount”) as follows: (i) first, we will reimburse the Sponsor for all expenses, other than asset management fees and incentive fees, that the Sponsor previously paid on our behalf, which will generally consist of operating expenses (the “Previously Paid Operating Expenses”) until all Previously Paid Operating Expenses incurred to date have been reimbursed; and (ii) second, we will apply 50% of the Excess Amount remaining after the payment of Previously Paid Operating Expenses to reimburse the Sponsor for the asset management fees and incentive fees that the Sponsor has agreed to pay on our behalf until all such asset management fees and incentive fees accrued to date have been reimbursed.  
 The Company did not meet the Reimbursement Hurdle for the quarters ended March 31, 2018, September 30, 2018, and December 31, 2018. The Company did meet the Reimbursement Hurdle for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, expenses of the Company covered by the Responsibility Agreement in the amount of $387,000 were paid as expense reimbursements to the Sponsor and have been recorded as expenses of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, there is a remaining aggregate balance of approximately $16,266,800 in expenses covered by the Responsibility Agreement which are not yet reimbursable to the Sponsor and have not been recorded by the Company. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, such expenses will be accrued and payable by the Company in the period that they become both probable and estimable.  The Sponsor may demand the reimbursement of cumulative Company expenses covered by the Responsibility Agreement to the extent the Company exceeds the Reimbursement Hurdle during any quarter. The Company cannot predict if or when this may occur.
 Investment Advisory Agreements and Fees 
 We have agreed to pay TriLinc Advisors an asset management fee and an incentive fee for its services under the Advisory Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred $7,971,062 and $6,484,850, respectively in 
 15


asset management fees and $6,212,931 and $4,599,941, respectively in incentive fees to our Advisor. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Sponsor assumed responsibility under the Responsibility Agreement for none of the asset management fee and $2,701,511 of the incentive fee. Our Sponsor did not assume responsibility under the Responsibility Agreement for any of the Company’s operating expenses, including asset management fees and incentive fees, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Asset Management Fee 
 The asset management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the asset management fee, the term “gross assets” means the total net fair value of the Company’s assets at the end of the quarter, other than intangibles and after the deduction of associated allowance and reserves, as determined by the Advisor in its sole discretion. 
Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee is comprised of two parts: (i) a subordinated incentive fee on income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. Each part of the incentive fee is outlined below. 
 The subordinated incentive fee on income is earned on pre-incentive fee net investment income and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar quarter during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of the termination. 
 The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on net assets at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.50% (6.0% annualized), subject to a “catch up” feature. The subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is calculated as follows: 
 No incentive fee is earned by the Advisor in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50%, or the preferred return. 
 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the quarterly preferred return, but is less than or equal to 1.875% (7.5% annualized) on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, in any quarter, is payable to the Advisor. We refer to this portion of our subordinated incentive fee on income as the catch up. It is intended to provide an incentive fee of 20% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.875% on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter in any quarter. 
 For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.875% on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the subordinated incentive fee on income equals 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, because the preferred return and catch up will have been achieved. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter, including the asset management fee and operating expenses reimbursed to the Advisor. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the quarterly subordinated incentive fee on income: 
 Quarterly Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (expressed as a percentage of net assets)

 allocated to quarterly incentive fee 
 The incentive fee on capital gains is earned on investments sold or matured and shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. In the case the Advisory Agreement is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of such termination. The fee will equal 20% of our realized capital gains, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains. Incentive fee on capital gains is equal to our realized capital 
 16


gains on a cumulative basis from inception, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. 
 Because of the structure of the subordinated incentive fee on income and the incentive fee on capital gains, it is possible that we may pay such fees in a quarter where we incur a net loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the 1.75% on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a net loss in the quarter due to a realized or unrealized capital loss. Our Advisor will not be under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it receives that is based on prior period accrued income that we never receive as a result of a subsequent decline in the value of our portfolio. 
 The fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated. The fees are calculated using a detailed policy and procedure approved by our Advisor and our board of managers, including a majority of the independent managers, and such policy and procedure is consistent with the description of the calculation of the fees set forth above. 
 Our Advisor may elect to defer or waive all or a portion of the fees that would otherwise be paid to it in its sole discretion. Any portion of a fee not taken as to any month, quarter or year will be deferred without interest and may be taken in any such other month prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event as our Advisor may determine in its sole discretion. 
 Investment Company Act Considerations 
 We have conducted and intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we and our subsidiaries will qualify for an exemption under, or otherwise will not be required to register as an investment company under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act. 
 Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 
 We conduct our business primarily through our direct and indirect wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, which were established to carry out specific activities. Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, the focus of our business involves providing loans and other financing of the nature described in this Form 10-K. We conduct our operations so that they comply with the limit imposed by the 40% test and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or actually engaged, in the business of investing in securities. Therefore, we expect that we will not be subject to registration or regulation as an investment company of any kind (including, without limitation, a face-amount certificate company, unit investment trust, open-end or closed-end company or a management company electing to be treated as a business development company) under the Investment Company Act. The securities issued to us by our wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, which subsidiaries will be neither investment companies nor companies exempt under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, will not be investment securities for the purpose of this 40% test. 
 One or more of our subsidiaries may seek to qualify for an exception or exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to other provisions of the Investment Company Act, such as Sections 3(c)(5)(A) which is available for entities “primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services” and Section 3(c)(5)(B) which is available for entities “primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance and services.” Each of these exemptions generally requires that at least 55% of such subsidiary’s assets be invested in eligible loans and receivables. To qualify for either of the foregoing exemptions, the subsidiary would be required to comply with interpretations issued by the staff of the SEC that govern the respective activities. 
 We monitor our holdings and those of our subsidiaries to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with these and/or other applicable tests, and we are responsible for making the determinations and calculations required to confirm our compliance with tests. If the SEC does not agree with our determinations, we may be required to adjust our activities and/or those of our subsidiaries. 
 Qualification for these or other exceptions or exemptions could affect our ability to originate, participate in or hold fixed-income assets, or could require us to dispose of investments that we might prefer to retain in order to remain qualified for such exemptions. Changes in current policies by the SEC and its staff could also require that we alter our business activities for this purpose. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the Investment Company Act, please see “Risk Factors.”

Competition 
 We compete with a large number of commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, private equity funds, leveraged buyout and venture capital funds, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based investment funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and build their market shares. 
 Concentration of credit risk 
 At December 31, 2018, our portfolio of $372,977,743 (at fair value) included 47 companies and was comprised of $88,858,707 or 23.8% in senior secured term loans, $189,157,819 or 50.7% in senior secured term loan participations, $80,236,312 or 21.5% in senior secured trade finance participations, and $13,644,683 or 3.7% in short term investments. Our largest loan by value was $21,367,121 or 5.7% of our total portfolio. Our 5 largest loans by value comprised 25.5% of our portfolio at December 31, 2018. Participation in loans represented 72.2% of our portfolio at December 31, 2018. 
 At December 31, 2018, 12 of our portfolio companies were on our watch list with an aggregate fair value of $48,727,952 or 13.1% of the fair value of the Company’s total investments. See Watch List Investments section in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information.
