ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
CPSI is a leading provider of healthcare solutions and services for community hospitals, their clinics and other healthcare systems. Founded in 1979, CPSI is the parent of six companies – Evident, LLC ("Evident"), American HealthTech, Inc. ("AHT"), TruBridge, LLC ("TruBridge"), iNetXperts, Corp. d/b/a Get Real Health, TruCode LLC ("TruCode"), and Healthcare Resource Group, Inc. ("HRG"). Our combined companies are focused on helping improve the health of the communities we serve, connecting communities for a better patient care experience, and improving the financial operations of our customers. Evident provides comprehensive acute care electronic healthcare record ("EHR") solutions for community hospitals and their affiliated clinics. AHT is one of the nation’s largest providers of post-acute care EHR solutions and services for post-acute care facilities. TruBridge focuses on providing business, consulting and managed information technology (" IT") services, along with its complete revenue cycle management ("RCM") solution, for all care settings. Get Real Health focuses on solutions aimed at improving patient engagement for individuals and healthcare providers. TruCode provides medical coding software that enables complete and accurate code assignment for proper reimbursement. HRG provides specialized RCM solutions for facilities of all sizes.
Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company operates its business in three operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: RCM, EHR, and Patient Engagement. The individual companies align with the reporting segments and contribute towards the combined focus of improving the health of the communities we serve as follows:
•The RCM reporting segment includes TruBridge, HRG, and TruCode, and focuses on providing business management, consulting, and managed IT services along with its complete RCM solution for all care settings, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider. 
•The EHR segment includes Evident and AHT, and provides comprehensive acute and post-acute care EHR solutions and related services for community hospitals, their physician clinics, and skilled nursing and assisted living facilities.
•The Patient Engagement segment offers comprehensive patient engagement and empowerment technology solutions through Get Real Health to improve patient outcomes and engagement strategies with care providers.
Our companies currently support community hospitals and other healthcare systems with a geographically diverse patient mix within the domestic community healthcare market. Our target market for our RCM, EHR, and Patient Engagement solutions includes community hospitals with fewer than 400 acute care beds, and their clinics, as well as independent or small to medium sized chains of skilled nursing facilities. Approximately 98% of our acute care hospital EHR customer base is comprised of hospitals with fewer than 100 beds. The target market for our post-acute care solutions consists of approximately 15,500 skilled nursing facilities that are either independently owned or part of a larger management group with multiple facilities. During 2022, we generated revenues of $326.6 million from the sale of our products and services.
See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our three reportable segments.
Industry Dynamics
The healthcare industry is the largest industry in the United States economy, comprising approximately 18.3% of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2021 according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). CMS estimates that national health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.1% through 2030 and will reach $6.8 trillion in 2030.
Hospital expenditures grew by 4.4% to approximately $1.3 trillion in 2021, slower than the 6.2% growth rate in 2020. According to the American Hospital Association’s AHA Hospital Statistics, 2021 Edition, there are approximately 4,700 community hospitals in the United States that are in our target market of hospitals with fewer than 400 beds, with approximately 2,900 of those having fewer than 100 acute care beds. In addition, there is a market of small specialty hospitals that focus on discrete medical areas such as surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care.
The healthcare industry is constantly challenged by changing economic dynamics, increased regulation and pressure to improve the quality of care. More recently, hospitals and health systems have continued to navigate financial and operational pressures that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the high costs associated with preparing for a surge of COVID-19 patients and resource-intensive treatment, added expense due to supply chain and labor market disruptions, and loss of revenue 
due to lower patient volumes for nonemergent care. These factors create an environment of escalating costs of care which, because of their heavy reliance on Medicare and Medicaid programs, our hospital clients have limited ability to recover through reimbursement changes. However, we believe healthcare providers can successfully address these issues with the help of our advanced medical information systems, including our RCM solutions and our suite of complementary services. Specific examples of the challenges and opportunities facing healthcare providers include the following:
Changing Economic Dynamics
The healthcare industry is heavily influenced by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal and state governments. These initiatives have a particularly significant impact on our customer base, as community hospitals generate a significant portion of their revenues from beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Consequently, even small changes in federal and state programs have a disproportionate effect on community hospitals as compared to larger facilities where greater portions of their revenues are generated from beneficiaries of private insurance programs. 
Medicare and Medicaid funding and reimbursements fluctuate annually and, with projected growth in healthcare costs, will continue to be scrutinized as the federal and state governments attempt to control the costs and growth of the program. As the federal government seeks to further limit deficit spending in the future due to fiscal restraints, it will likely continue to place constraints on healthcare spending programs such as Medicare and Medicaid matching grants, which will place further cost pressures on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Further reductions in reimbursements from these programs could lead to hospitals postponing expenditures on information technology and may motivate hospitals to revisit long-held cost structures, which could positively impact demand for RCM and other services.
While legislative and regulatory initiatives are placing significant pressure on the related reimbursements, community hospitals are also faced with likely increased demand for Medicare and Medicaid services. The challenges posed by this dual-threat are complicated by the shift away from volume-based reimbursement towards value-based reimbursement, linking reimbursement to quality measurements and outcomes. The increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and value-based reimbursement models is transforming domestic healthcare delivery into a more patient-centric experience. This transformation brings about new and increased data needs, resulting in additional regulatory demands for data that patients find useful in decision-making. These new regulatory demands increase regulatory risks and compliance burdens for CPSI and our clients, but also pose opportunities for CPSI to provide additional value-added products and services to our target market.
To compete in the continually changing healthcare environment, providers are increasingly using technology in order to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices, to assist in enhancing patient care, and to maintain the privacy and security of patient information. Healthcare providers are placing increased demands on their information systems to accomplish these tasks. We believe that information systems must facilitate management of patient information across administrative, financial and clinical tasks and must also effectively interface with a variety of payor organizations within the increasingly complex reimbursement environment.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
In 2009, the U.S. federal government enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the "ARRA"), which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"). HITECH authorized the EHR incentive program, which provided significant incentive funding to physicians and hospitals that have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. The end result of the ARRA has been to accelerate the adoption of EHR technology nationwide, significantly increasing industry-wide penetration rates and our penetration rates within our existing customer base for our current menu of applications. As a result, the revenue opportunities for new customer additions have greatly diminished, as have our opportunities for add-on sales to existing customers.
Continued Push for Improved Patient Care
With the increased pressure to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce costs, there is a general shift towards value-based reimbursement, which increases the demand for information technology solutions for clinical decision support. This migration toward clinical decision support solutions is further supported by the ARRA. 
In the face of decreasing revenue and increasing pressure to improve patient care, healthcare providers are in need of management tools and related services that (1) increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services, (2) reduce medical errors, (3) effectively track the cost of delivering services so that those costs can be properly managed and (4) increase the speed and rate of reimbursement. A hospital’s failure to adequately invest in a modern medical information system could result in fewer patient referrals, cost inefficiencies, lower than expected reimbursement, increased malpractice risk and possible regulatory infractions. Additionally, we believe that the industry will continue to increase its utilization of third party services 
that contribute to the achievement of these and other objectives necessary for success in the current environment. We believe these dynamics should allow for future revenue growth for both our information technology solutions and our complementary suite of services.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Following heroic efforts by healthcare providers on the frontlines and advances in technology and science bringing vaccines to market in an unprecedented timeframe, the healthcare industry continues to deal with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including financial disruptions and critical labor shortages. Looking beyond 2022, we believe there will be continued pressure on hospital staffing, creating greater demand for automation and machine learning to allow staff to focus on patient care. Payors are experiencing staffing issues, similar to hospitals, which is causing delays in authorizations, denials and extended processing times for appeals. As a result of these issues and pressures, we expect ongoing and continued growth in demand for our RCM and related services.
The pandemic has also heightened patient interest and demand for digital engagement. While purchasing demand for digital patient engagement solutions in the United States has not yet fully materialized, we believe healthcare leaders will embrace the digital acceleration, identifying new channels to connect with patients and strengthen the patient experience over the next few years. Our digital front door technology helps create efficiencies and patient engagement that lead to greater patient connections and improved care. We also expect to see continued health care policy legislation focused on patients, like pricing transparency and the No Surprises Act, which is intended to address unexpected gaps in insurance coverage that result in "surprise medical bills" when patients unknowingly obtain medical services (such as emergency services) from out-of-network providers.
Strategy
Our primary objectives are to increase the market share of our RCM solutions and services, maintain a strong retention rate within our EHR client base while pursuing competitive and vulnerable EHR replacement opportunities, and further establish our position as a leading provider of patient engagement solutions. These objectives are all in support of our corporate strategy, centered around the following components:
Core Growth
Our core growth initiatives include cross-selling RCM solutions and services into our existing sizeable EHR client base and expanding our RCM market share with sales to new community hospitals and larger health systems.
Over the course of our more than 40-year history, we have developed a significant customer base of community hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. This customer base is our most valuable asset, providing not only the critical mass necessary to scale our development, client support and service resources to meet the evolving needs of our customers, but also serving as fertile ground for our cross-selling efforts for additional value-added solutions and services. Chief among our cross-sell opportunities is RCM, where we utilize our industry-leading RCM services and solutions to improve the financial health of our EHR clients by improving cash flow metrics in the face of the myriad cost and reimbursement challenges facing healthcare organizations. Our operational expertise and technology tools provide proven results in improving claim acceptance rates, accelerating payments from third party payors, and increasing private pay collections. 
Margin Optimization
These efforts support the core growth efforts as we routinely seek, find and execute on initiatives that modernize our business, increasing our efficiency and resulting in cost savings that allow us to reinvest in additional growth opportunities.
Chief among our margin optimization initiatives are parallel workstreams dedicated to (1) standardizing and streamlining existing workflows by leveraging automation to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of our services, and (2) systematically leveraging offshore resources to mitigate the high costs and disruption risks associated with single-source talent markets. Talent availability has proven to be a significant challenge for our mostly-domestic customer base, and our nationwide reach does little to mitigate this nationwide dilemma. With talent scarcity a real risk and prospects for growth that require significant scale, the successful execution of our growth prospects requires both broadening our talent pool beyond the domestic market and ensuring talent resources are put to their highest and best use.
Digital Innovation
In addition to our core growth and margin optimization initiatives is a focus on identifying new innovation and larger adjacency opportunities, driven by demand for patient engagement, industry insights, reporting and analytics technology.
As today's patients and providers have a more collaborative approach to healthcare, our patient engagement offerings provide a secure ecosystem that supports home care, clinicians, and the patients they serve by providing tools and analytics to provide a complete view of patients' health and improve health outcomes. In addition to supporting improved care, our patient engagement platform provides financial benefits to providers and hospital systems through increased revenue opportunities and digital transformation of workflows to fill staffing gaps. This platform gives healthcare providers the insights and tools they need to provide efficient, cost-effective care as they collaborate with today's growing population of engaged patients.
Underpinning each of the three components to our strategy is a capital allocation strategy designed to afford the flexibility necessary to be adaptive and opportunistic with future investment decisions. Such flexibility is necessary if we are to continue to bring timely products and services to a rapidly changing healthcare landscape. We serve the needs of multiple stakeholder groups as customers benefit from the related products and services, our employees benefit from expanded opportunities for development, and our stockholders benefit from the increasing diversity in revenue sources.

Acute Care Support and Maintenance Services
After EHR installation, we provide software application support, hardware maintenance, continuing education and related services pursuant to a support agreement using our collaborative support model. The following describes services provided to customers using Thrive and Centriq:
• Total System Support. We believe the quality of continuing customer support is one of the most critical considerations in the selection of an information system provider. We provide hardware, technical and software support for all aspects of our system, which gives us the flexibility to take the necessary course of action to resolve any issue. Unlike our competitors who use third-party services for hardware and software support, we provide a single, convenient and efficient resource for all of our customers’ system support needs. In order to minimize the impact of a system problem, we train our customer service personnel to be technically proficient, courteous and prompt. Because a properly functioning information system is crucial to a hospital’s operations, our support teams are available 24 hours per day to assist customers with any problem that may arise. Customers can also use the Internet to directly access our support system. 
• National Client Conference. All of our customers have the opportunity to attend our annual National Client Conference. CPSI hosts this conference to provide educational sessions, product demonstrations, and one-on-one time with application experts. The conference also allows important time for networking among customers and CPSI staff across all business platforms. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our National Client Conference was held virtually in 2020 and 2021. In May 2022, the conference returned to an in-person event.
• Continuing Education. Effective learning tools are a key factor in successful EHR adoption and allowing clients to get the most out of a software investment. Therefore, ongoing learning and training is a cornerstone to our “total solution” and a key competitive differentiator. Our ongoing learning and training offerings also address some of the unique needs of community hospitals - limited resources and staff with cross-department responsibilities and budget and time constraints - all of which require a customized approach to learning and training. To meet these needs, Evident offers customers with online content that can be accessed at any time, scheduled online interactive classroom presentations, on-campus training at our facilities, educational sessions during user group conferences, and scheduled regional training sessions. 
• Software Releases. We are committed to providing our customers with software and technology solutions that will continue to meet their information system needs. To accomplish this purpose, we continually work to enhance and improve our application programs. As part of this effort, for each customer covered under our general support agreement, we provide software updates as they become available at no additional cost. We design these enhancements to be seamlessly integrated into each customer’s existing system. The benefit of 
these enhancements is that each customer, regardless of its original installation date, uses the most advanced software available. Through this process, we can keep our customers up-to-date with the latest operational innovations in the healthcare industry as well as with changing governmental regulatory requirements. Another benefit of this "one system" concept is that our customer service teams can be more effective in responding to customer needs because they maintain a complete understanding of and familiarity with the one system that all customers use.
 Purchasing a new information technology system requires the expenditure of a substantial amount of capital and other resources, and many customers are concerned that these systems will become obsolete as technology changes. Our periodic product updates eliminate our customers’ concerns about system obsolescence. We believe providing this benefit is a strong incentive for potential customers to select our products over the products of our competitors.
• Hardware Replacement. As part of our general support agreements, we are also committed to promptly replacing malfunctioning system hardware in order to minimize the effect of operational interruptions. By offering replacements of all hardware used in our system, we believe we are better able to meet and address all of the information technology needs of our customers.
• Cloud Electronic Health Record (Cloud EHR). We offer Cloud EHR services to customers via remote access telecommunications. Cloud EHR is a "Software as a Service" (or "SaaS") configuration and is a monthly subscription to access and use application software maintained by CPSI in a cloud environment. Under this configuration, a customer is able to obtain access to an advanced EHR without a significant initial capital outlay. We store and maintain all Cloud EHR customers’ critical patient and administrative data. These customers access this information remotely through direct telecommunications connections.
• Forms and Supplies. In addition to our support services, we offer our customers the standard and customized forms that they need for their patient and financial records, as well as the supplies necessary to support the operation of their server and peripheral equipment. Furnishing these forms and supplies helps us to achieve our objective of being a one-source solution for a hospital’s complete healthcare information system requirements.
•Public Cloud Infrastructure – During 2021, we formed a strategic partnership with Microsoft for Azure cloud hosting and infrastructure services, with the end-goal of migrating all existing internal and client data to Azure’s public cloud and utilizing the related infrastructure solutions to enhance both internal and client-facing processes and services. The eventual migration to Azure, which began during 2022, will benefit customers by removing the burden of maintaining their own on-premise infrastructure while the underlying applications will operate with higher availability and stability, reducing unexpected downtime. This modernized infrastructure will open the door to future innovations and data access as well.

Software Development 
The healthcare information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to continually make investments to update, enhance and improve our products and services. Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. We capitalize incurred labor costs for software development from the time the preliminary project phase is completed until the software is available for general release. Research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred. We estimate the useful life of our capitalized software and amortize its value on a straight-line basis over that estimated life, which is estimated to be five years. If the actual useful life of the asset is determined to be shorter than our estimated useful life, we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life, or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and, accordingly, a write-down of the value of the asset may be recorded as a charge to earnings. Amortization begins when the related features are placed in service.
Total product development expenses included in our consolidated results of operations were approximately $30.9 million, $30.4 million and $33.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We capitalized software development costs of approximately $19.1 million, $9.4 million and $3.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on software development costs.
Product Management 
We utilize an Application Portfolio Management (“APM”) framework to collect product metrics across all products and business units to enhance our product strategy with richer data that highlights opportunities. APM anchors our investments through identification of the most pressing issues, creating alignment within the organization and investing to maximize impact. Supplementing insights derived from APM, we continue to utilize our customer councils (Provider, Nursing, Chief Financial Officer, and Client Advisory) to prioritize and validate our product strategy.
Accessibility, scalability and usability serve as our critical product pillars, with recent investments in modern user experiences and improved workflows having addressed all three. For example:
•Through data normalization efforts and the creation of a unified data model with our CHBase Unify product technology, our ability to develop and deploy solutions on our cloud software platform has accelerated. These foundational instruments have accelerated the pace of innovation, which has also created additional marketplace opportunities for our customers.
•By deploying solutions such as robotic process automation, we continuously strive to optimize user workflows for our clinical and financial solutions, increasing efficiencies and delivering modern user experiences.
•By investing in new patient engagement and communication solutions, we have improved staff, provider and patient interactions and increased patient participation in their healthcare experience.
System Implementation and Training
Conversion Services. When a client purchases or leases one of our systems, we convert their existing data to the new system. Our knowledge of hospital data processing, in conjunction with extensive in-house technical expertise, allows us to accomplish this task in a cost effective manner. When we install a new system, the data conversion has already occurred so that the system is immediately operational. Our goal is for each client to be productive on day one in order to eliminate time and money wasted on the costly and inefficient task of maintaining the same data on parallel systems. Our services also relieve the hospital staff of the time-consuming burden of data conversion. The conversion process is the initial phase of our long-term partnership and overall client experience.
Training. In order to integrate the new system and to ensure its success, we spend approximately sixteen weeks providing individualized training remotely and on-site at the go-live. We provide hardware and software application training for all hospital users, including staff members and healthcare providers, during all hospital shifts. We employ nurses, medical technicians, and providers along with our technical training staff in order to help us communicate more effectively with our clients during the training process. This training phase is also part of the overall client experience that is provided to all of our clients.
Clients, Sales and Marketing
Target Markets
The target market for our RCM product and services extends beyond hospitals of less than 100 beds, where we have historically focused our EHR efforts. We are acutely focused on our vision of selling our RCM solution to both our existing customer base, as well as to hospitals of 400 beds or under in the United States. There are approximately 4,700 of these hospitals with fewer than 400 beds. In addition, we market our RCM services to post-acute care facilities, of which there are approximately 15,500 in the United States. 
Our strategy to grow our RCM business is centered around leveraging our established sales relationships within our substantial acute and post-acute EHR customer base in order to cross sell RCM services. In addition, we target hospitals that use competitor EHRs and upmarket larger hospitals and health systems that manage their RCM operations in-house. The hospitals are under increasing financial pressure caused by fluctuating patient volumes, increasing self-pay accounts, and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A core initiative to our growth plan is to maintain a strong retention rate across our EHR base and pursue conservative growth of new EHR clients, as they are critical to driving cross-sales of our RCM solutions. We target hospitals under 100 beds in the United States that we believe are currently using a vendor that we have determined is vulnerable based on a variety of factors. Our goal in the ambulatory market is to aggressively target physician practices in those communities where the local hospital is a current CPSI client.
The target market for our acute care EHR systems consists of community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with a primary focus on hospitals with fewer than 100 acute care beds. In the United States, there are approximately 3,800 community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with approximately 2,900 having fewer than 100 acute care beds. In addition, we market our products to small specialty hospitals in the United States that focus on discrete medical areas such as behavioral health, surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care. Approximately 98% of our existing acute care clients are hospitals with fewer than 100 acute care beds.
The target market for our post-acute care EHR solution consists of approximately 15,500 long-term care and skilled nursing facilities in the United States. In addition, through a strategic relationship with Medtelligent, we are able to market an EHR for 
assisted living facilities creating add-on sales opportunities in our direct client base and new sales opportunities across the broader senior living market. Our goal in the post-acute care market is to continue to target both individual facilities as well as larger multi-facility corporate entities. In addition, we intend to extend our penetration into the post-acute care market by offering an assisted living facility EHR solution that we believe will broaden the appeal of our solutions to those operators who offer multiple care settings in their organizations.
Our patient engagement efforts continue to focus on the international market through our substantial international partner ecosystem while also initiating penetration of the domestic market. We target hospitals that use competitor EHRs, including upmarket larger hospitals and health systems that support multiple EHRs and data sources around affiliated providers and practices. The target market for our domestic launch is acute care EHR systems of community hospitals that are part of a hospital system. In the United States, there are approximately 3,400 community hospitals that fall into this category. Target markets internationally and domestically also include government healthcare and health information exchanges focused on leveraging technology to drive efficient care delivery in addition to citizen portal initiatives.

Sales Staff
We have dedicated sales organizations in all three business units: RCM, EHR, and patient engagement. Many of our sales personnel are hired from within the Company and have previous experience in client support roles. We believe this experience positions them to more effectively sell our products and services within our target markets. We have also added some talent from outside the Company, creating a depth of experience we believe will enhance the effectiveness of the teams. Our sales organizations are generally divided into four areas: sales management, new client sales, existing client sales and sales support staff. New client sales staff are typically organized based on geographic territories, though we also have sales personnel that focus on national accounts in our post-acute care EHR business due to the number of national chain operators in that market. Our sales representatives who sell to existing clients have assigned clients within their territory, which is also geographically based. Some sales representatives in our services areas are assigned specifically to cross-sell services into our acute care EHR and post-acute care EHR client bases. A significant portion of the compensation for all sales personnel is commission based except for administrative support staff.
Marketing Strategy
Our corporate marketing strategy positions CPSI as a healthcare solutions company serving community healthcare organizations through our family of healthcare information technology companies. 
With regard to our RCM solutions, we will continue to leverage our proven track record of success in accounts receivable management and private pay collections for community healthcare providers. With the increasing complexity of reimbursement requirements and a global shift in healthcare towards an increase in patient financial responsibility, the ability of our services business to bring expertise and best practice operational efficiencies to bear is a significant competitive advantage. In consulting services, the added complexity brought about by the transition to the ICD-10 code set, a standard transaction code set for diagnostic purposes under HIPAA, has created a significant demand for our coding services. Our strategy is to cross sell our RCM solutions into our loyal EHR customer base as we prioritize strengthening our client relationships. At the same time, we target the 400 bed and less hospital market outside of our EHR client network, which hospitals have a need to improve revenue cycles and address staffing issues.
Our EHR software and services address providers across the care continuum, with a primary focus on the community healthcare market. We believe our ability to serve ambulatory, acute and post-acute care settings with our products is another strategic advantage as new reimbursement models force the coordination of care by healthcare providers. Our ability to connect patients 
to care providers within their community and across communities through our own products and interoperability development, including our membership in the CommonWell Health Alliance, sets us apart from other competitors in our market. Our goal is to position ourselves as partners to community healthcare providers as they move to a more proactive care model based on the use of data analytics and patient engagement tools.
Our strategy to grow our patient engagement business is centered around leveraging our established customer relationships within our substantial partner ecosystem for continued sales around licensing and professional services. In addition, we target hospitals that use competitor EHRs, including upmarket larger hospitals and health systems that support multiple EHRs and data sources around affiliated providers and practices. A core initiative to our growth plan is to maintain a strong retention rate of this client base and pursue rapid growth of new clients domestically.
Backlog
Backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts. The revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one-time fees for system sales and recurring fees for support and maintenance and RCM services. As of December 31, 2022, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $6 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $322 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and RCM services. As of December 31, 2021, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $5 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $281 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and RCM services.
Competition
The market for our products and services is competitive, and we expect additional competition from established and emerging companies in the future. Our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, global shifts in the healthcare system, evolving user needs and impactful regulatory and reimbursement changes. We believe the principal competitive factors that hospitals, clinics and post-acute care providers consider when choosing between us and our competitors are:
•perceived level of product and system security;
•product features, functionality and performance;
•range of services offered;
•level of client service and satisfaction;
•ease of integration and speed of implementation;
•product price;
•cost of services offered;
•results of services engagements;
•knowledge of the healthcare industry;
•training provided;
•sales and marketing efforts; and
•company reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on these factors. Our principal competitors for RCM solutions include RelayHealth Corp, SSI Group, LLC, Quadax Inc., Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc., Availity, LLC, and Navicure, Inc. Our principal competitors in the business management, consulting and managed IT services market are Resolution Health, Inc., The Outsource Group Inc., Patient Focus, Inc., Xtend Healthcare Inc., Ensemble Health Partners, and nThrive, Inc. These companies all focus on providing services to the healthcare market, and the services they offer are comparable in socpe to the competing services we offer. Secondary competitors in the RCM space include ARx LLC, Citadel Outsource Group LLC, Patient Matters, LLC, KIWI-TEK, LLC, and Aviacode Inc. TruCode's primary competitors include 3M, Nuance and Optum.
Our principal competitors in the acute care EHR market are Cerner Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. ("Meditech"), and MEDHOST, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of small and midsize 
hospitals. They offer comparable products and systems that address the needs of hospitals in the markets we serve. Our secondary competitors in the acute care EHR market include N. Harris Computer Corporation and Epic Systems Corporation. These companies are significantly larger than we are, and they typically sell their products and services to larger hospitals outside of our target market. However, they will sometimes compete with us directly or, more commonly, when a larger health system who uses a system from one of these companies will offer it to a smaller hospital as part of a merger or alliance. 
We also face competition from providers of practice management systems, general decision support and database systems and other segment-specific applications. Any of these companies as well as other technology or healthcare companies could decide at any time to specifically target hospitals within our target market.
Our principal competitors in the post-acute care EHR market are PointClickCare Corporation and MatrixCare, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of long-term post-acute care facilities. They offer comparable products and systems that address the needs of long-term care providers. 
Our principal competitors in the patient engagement market include Relay Health, Get Well Network/Healthloop, Apollo Care Connect, Bridge Patient Portal, eClinicalWorks Patient Portal, Influence Health, and InteliChart.
Health Information Security and Privacy Practices
HIPAA is a federal law governing the use, disclosure, transmission and storage of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as "protected health information," and that was enacted for the purpose of, among other things, protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. As directed by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (the "DHHS") has promulgated standards and rules for certain electronic health transactions, code sets, data security, unique identification numbers and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA and the standards promulgated by DHHS apply to certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as "covered entities"), which includes our hospital and post-acute care clients. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the "HITECH Act") and its implementing regulations published in January 2013 significantly expand HIPAA by extending privacy and security standards to "business associates" of healthcare providers that are covered entities. Under the HITECH Act, business associates are required to establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards and are subject to direct penalties for violations. Certain of our services frequently require us to act as a healthcare clearinghouse and/or a business associate to the hospitals and post-acute care clients that we serve. As a result, we are covered by the patient privacy and security standards of HIPAA and subject to oversight by DHHS. We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to comply with HIPAA, as it applies to us as a business associate, but it is important to note that DHHS could, at any time in the future, adopt new rules or modify existing rules in a manner that could require us to change our systems or operations.
Protecting individually identifiable health information and other sensitive data is a critical and essential function of CPSI’s operations and its software solutions. A variety of industry-standard approaches that meet or exceed regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and HITECH are employed. In order to avoid unauthorized access for the life span of this data, diverse methods of identification, authentication, authorization and encryption are utilized at various points throughout the operating system, application software and hardware. These methods and processes are shared amongst servers and other end-user devices and are complemented by change management processes and tools, which allow the software change control cycle to be a formal, defined process.
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of any personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.
Managing Cybersecurity Risks
Our business operations, including the provision of the products and services described above, involve the compilation and transmission of confidential information, including patient health information. We have included security features in our 
systems that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of this information, but our systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors and other similar disruptive problems.
The Board of Directors is responsible for exercising oversight of management’s identification of, and planning for, the material risks facing the Company, and we believe our policies and procedures are adequate to ensure that relevant information about cybersecurity risks and incidents is appropriately reported and disclosed. In October 2017, the Board authorized the formation of a Cybersecurity Committee, which is now known as the Governance, Risk & Compliance (“GRC”) Committee. The GRC Committee is currently comprised of the Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Transformation Officer, General Manager of TruBridge, Corporate Security Officer, and General Counsel and Corporate Compliance Officer. The GRC Committee generally meets weekly, and has a formal meeting quarterly, to discuss the primary security and compliance-related risks currently facing the Company, including cybersecurity risks. The General Counsel and Corporate Compliance Officer then provides updates to the Board at each regular quarterly meeting. In October 2020, the Board created the Innovation and Technology Committee to aid the Board in its duties to assess and oversee the management of risks in the areas of information technology, information and data security, cybersecurity, disaster recovery, data privacy and business continuity. This committee oversees the GRC Committee’s activities relating to information technology and cybersecurity matters, and seeks to enhance communication and coordination of efforts between the Board and management in these areas.
Additionally, we appointed a Security Operations Center ("SOC") Director to oversee a number of initiatives designed to improve our cybersecurity protection, readiness and response. The Company partnered with a third party to provide Security as a Service ("SECaaS") to assist our internal SOC in reducing the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity attack. The SOC oversees penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, intrusion prevention, endpoint and insider threat detection, log management and other cybersecurity-related projects. The Company consulted with third parties in 2017 and 2018 to conduct an evaluation of our cybersecurity risks. The Company also consulted with third parties to achieve ISO 27001 certification related to information security management, which was achieved during 2020. Finally, all users employed by or contracted to the Company are required to complete annual cybersecurity education and training, which includes identifying suspicious emails, internet threats, telecommunication threats and ransomware.
Although a portion of our workforce has returned to in-office environments following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the successful expansion of work-from-home arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of employee productivity and satisfaction, has resulted in many of these arrangements becoming permanent. As such, we anticipate that our go-forward workforce will be more heavily distributed to remote work environments, and we will continue to focus on not introducing vulnerabilities into our technology systems..
Intellectual Property
We regard some aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation as proprietary, and rely primarily on a combination of contract and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We believe, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our vendors, consultants and clients, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.
We do not believe our software products or other CPSI proprietary rights infringe on the property rights of third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation.
Material Government Regulations
Our business operations are subject to various federal, state and international laws, and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations.  For example, we are affected by the following regulations:
•As discussed above, the HIPAA security and privacy standards affect our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations, and GDPR is applicable to certain of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU and our operations that are targeting clients and activities within the EU.
•The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has determined that certain of our solutions, such as our ImageLink® and Blood Administration ® products, are medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended.
•The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing and electronic routing of prescriptions via the Surescripts network to pharmacies is governed by federal and state laws.  States have differing regulations that govern the electronic transmission of certain prescriptions and prescription requirements.
Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws, rules and other regulations applicable to our operations, products or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate materially increased expenditures in response to government regulations or future material impacts to our results or competitiveness.  These regulations and related risks are described in more detail below under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 23 of this Annual Report.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,500 employees, the majority of which are remote, with the remaining employees located at our offices in Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Minnesota. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and retain top talent in order to deliver a one-of-a-kind service and to fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed customer expectations and meet our growth objectives. By improving employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our customers and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. To that end, we strive to foster an engaged, diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where employees have equitable opportunities for success.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, where everyone is inspired to be the best they can be and feels empowered to openly express opinions and ideas that help drive innovation, progress, and excellence. We eagerly promote our relentless commitment to creating an inclusive and respectful culture across our family of companies. We are steadfast in our responsibility to embrace the diversity of all people and demonstrate our values – collaborative, dependable, proactive, empathetic and agile - with an unwavering focus on those essential to the Company achieving sustainable and meaningful growth. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity ("EEO"), as evidenced by the Company’s EEO policy.
As part of our commitment the Company launched our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity Alliance ("Team IDEA") in 2020, an employee-led council with executive sponsorship that is focused on strengthening company-wide engagement on diversity, equity and inclusion, providing learning opportunities for our employees, and helping to identify areas for improvement and monitor progress against these initiatives. In 2022, Team IDEA conducted over 20 employee engagement events and deployed several Company policy updates that extend greater benefit with inclusiveness, care, and compassion at the forefront.
Now, more than ever, we are committed to listening with open hearts and leading with empathy — toward each other, toward our customers and toward our healthcare communities. We continue to invite our leaders, board, clients, and community leaders, along with our chief people officer, to advise us along this journey. In 2022, we launched an employee volunteer program that constructs a direct bridge between employees and the community and encourages employees to put their interests, skill sets, and time to use in solving community challenges. 
Compensation and Benefits
We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation program is designed to recognize our employees' contributions to service excellence and business results. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonus, commissions and merit increases which vary across the Company. In addition, as part of our incentive plan for executives and certain employees, we provide stock-based compensation to attract, retain and motivate our key leaders. For further information concerning our equity incentive plans, see Note 9, Stock-based Compensation and Equity.
As the success of our employees is fundamentally connected to the well being of our people, our healthcare and benefit programs focus on four key pillars: physical, emotional, financial, and social well-being. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurances, a 401(K) plan with employer-match, generous time-off, paid parental leave, identity theft insurance, and financial support. We provide emotional well-being services through our medical carrier, Neuro580, and associated Employee Assistance Program. In addition, our financial education tools offer employees resources to reach their personal financial goals.
We continue to partner with our employees to understand how we can better support their health and wellness while allowing them to be their true and authentic selves at work every day.
Development
Our goal is to create opportunities for employee growth, development, education and training, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company. We strive to ensure that we have the right leaders in place to drive our strategic initiatives not only today but also into the future. We are committed to a safe workplace and an ethical environment in which employees are respected in a culture of belonging and dignity and in which they can continually develop their skills and expertise to advance their careers.
We also believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our Performance Development Program that summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new goals, and identifies critical capabilities for development. We encourage managers to solicit and share supportive 360-degree feedback, align talent with enterprise opportunities, and infuse a mindset of continuous learning and deliberate practices needed to drive global success.
Employee Recruitment
Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding of our business, vision, products, services and clients among our employee base, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. As a direct result of the operational COVID-19 pandemic adjustments made to the organization during 2020, the opportunity became available to offer more remote positions, whereas before, they would have been conducted from within an office space. Leveraging work collaboration tools and other technologies, the ability to hire remote employees has supported our efforts to expand our internal talent and welcome employees from diverse backgrounds and geographies, creating deeper team collaboration and a more engaging client experience. Our recruitment team uses internal and external resources to recruit diverse, highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.
Communication and Engagement
Given the geographic diversity of our workforce, we use multiple modalities in our communication efforts. Our email and the employee hotline have been bolstered by weekly all-employee communications. Additionally, leaders participate in monthly business updates that facilitate awareness of current business initiatives, progress and results. These meetings encourage cross-functional collaboration and help ensure that our teams are not working in silos. These efforts have supported our ability to deliver a more consistent message across all our constituencies and thereby improve employee engagement.
