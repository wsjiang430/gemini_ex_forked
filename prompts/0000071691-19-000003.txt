ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
The New York Times Company (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 26, 1896, under the laws of the State of New York. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “our” and “us.”
We are a global media organization focused on creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information. Our continued commitment to premium content and journalistic excellence makes The New York Times brand a trusted source of news and information for readers and viewers across various platforms. Recognized widely for the quality of our reporting and content, our publications have been awarded many industry and peer accolades, including 125 Pulitzer Prizes and citations, more than any other news organization.
The Company includes newspapers, print and digital products and related businesses. We have one reportable segment with businesses that include:

• | our newspaper, The New York Times (“The Times”);


• | our websites, including NYTimes.com;


• | our mobile applications, including The Times’s core news applications, as well as interest-specific applications, including our Crossword and Cooking products; and


• | related businesses, such as our licensing division; our digital marketing agencies; our product review and recommendation website, Wirecutter; our commercial printing operations; NYT Live (our live events business); and other products and services under The Times brand.

We generate revenues principally from subscriptions and advertising. Subscription revenues consist of revenues from subscriptions to our print and digital products (which include our news products, as well as our Crossword and Cooking products) and single-copy sales of our print newspaper. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of our advertising products and services on our print and digital platforms. Revenue information for the Company appears under “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Revenues, operating profit and identifiable assets of our foreign operations each represent less than 10% of our total revenues, operating profit and identifiable assets.
During 2018, we continued to make significant investments in our journalism, while taking further steps to position our organization to operate more efficiently in a digital environment. The Times continued to break stories and produce investigative reports that sparked global conversations on wide-ranging topics. We launched

groundbreaking digital journalism projects and new news and opinion podcasts that complement The Daily, our news podcast that launched in 2017 and was the most downloaded podcast on Apple’s iTunes in 2018. We also announced the creation of a new television show, “The Weekly,” which will begin airing in mid-2019. In addition, we continued to create innovative digital advertising solutions across our platforms and expand our creative services offerings.
We believe that the significant growth over the last year in subscriptions to our products demonstrates the success of our “subscription-first” strategy and the willingness of our readers to pay for high-quality journalism. We had approximately 4.3 million subscriptions to our products as of December 30, 2018, more than at any point in our history. 
PRODUCTS
The Company’s principal business consists of distributing content generated by our newsroom through our digital and print platforms. In addition, we distribute selected content on third-party platforms. 
Our core news website, NYTimes.com, was launched in 1996. Since 2011, we have charged consumers for content provided on this website and our core news mobile application. Digital subscriptions can be purchased individually or through group corporate or group education subscriptions. Our metered model offers users free access to a set number of articles per month and then charges users for access to content beyond that limit.
In addition to subscriptions to our news product, we offer standalone subscriptions to other digital products, namely our Crossword and Cooking products. Certain digital news product subscription packages include access to our Crossword and Cooking products. 
Our products also include news and opinion podcasts, which are distributed both on our digital platforms and on third-party platforms. We generate advertising and licensing revenue from this content, but do not charge users for access.
The Times’s print edition newspaper, published seven days a week in the United States, commenced publication in 1851. The Times also has an international edition that is tailored for global audiences. First published in 2013 and previously called the International New York Times, the international edition succeeded the International Herald Tribune, a leading daily newspaper that commenced publishing in Paris in 1887. Our print newspapers are sold in the United States and around the world through individual home-delivery subscriptions, bulk subscriptions (primarily by schools and hotels) and single-copy sales. All print home-delivery subscribers are entitled to receive free access to some or all of our digital products.
SUBSCRIPTIONS AND AUDIENCE
Our content reaches a broad audience through our digital and print platforms. As of December 30, 2018, we had approximately 4.3 million paid subscriptions across 217 countries and territories to our digital and print products. 
Paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 3,360,000 as of December 30, 2018, an increase of approximately 27% compared with December 31, 2017. This amount includes standalone paid subscriptions to our Crossword and Cooking products, which totaled approximately 647,000 as of December 30, 2018. International digital-only news subscriptions represented approximately 16% of our digital-only news subscriptions as of December 30, 2018.
The number of paid digital-only subscriptions also includes estimated group corporate and group education subscriptions (which collectively represent approximately 6% of total paid digital subscriptions to our news products). The number of paid group subscriptions is derived using the value of the relevant contract and a discounted basic subscription rate. The actual number of users who have access to our products through group subscriptions is substantially higher.
In the United States, The Times had the largest daily and Sunday print circulation of all seven-day newspapers for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, according to data collected by the Alliance for Audited Media (“AAM”), an independent agency that audits circulation of most U.S. newspapers and magazines.
For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, The Times’s average print circulation (which includes paid and qualified circulation of the newspaper in print) was approximately 487,000 for weekday (Monday to Friday) and 992,000 for Sunday. (Under AAM’s reporting guidance, qualified circulation represents copies available for individual 
P. 2 – THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY

consumers that are either non-paid or paid by someone other than the individual, such as copies delivered to schools and colleges and copies purchased by businesses for free distribution.)
Internationally, average circulation for the international edition of our newspaper (which includes paid circulation of the newspaper in print and electronic replica editions) for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, was approximately 170,000 (estimated) and 173,000, respectively. These figures follow the guidance of Office de Justification de la Diffusion, an agency based in Paris and a member of the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations that audits the circulation of most newspapers and magazines in France. The final 2018 figure will not be available until April 2019.
According to comScore Media Metrix, an online audience measurement service, in 2018, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 94 million unique visitors in the United States on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices. Globally, including the United States, NYTimes.com had a 2018 monthly average of approximately 134 million unique visitors on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices, according to internal data estimates. 
ADVERTISING 
We have a comprehensive portfolio of advertising products and services. Our advertising revenue is divided into two main categories: 
Display Advertising
Display advertising revenue is principally generated from advertisers (such as financial institutions, movie studios, department stores, American and international fashion and technology) promoting products, services or brands on our digital and print platforms.
In print, column-inch ads are priced according to established rates, with premiums for color and positioning. The Times had the largest market share in 2018 in print advertising revenue among a national newspaper set that consists of USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Times, according to MediaRadar, an independent agency that measures advertising sales volume and estimates advertising revenue.
On our digital platforms, display advertising comprises banners, video, rich media and other interactive ads. Display advertising also includes branded content on The Times’s platforms. Branded content is longer form marketing content that is distinct from The Times’s editorial content.
In 2018, print and digital display advertising represented approximately 84% of our advertising revenues.
Other Advertising
Other print advertising primarily includes classified advertising paid for on a per line basis; revenues from preprinted advertising, also known as free standing inserts; and advertising revenues from our licensing division. 
Other digital advertising primarily includes creative services fees associated with our branded content studio and our digital marketing agencies, including HelloSociety and Fake Love; advertising revenue generated by our podcasts; advertising revenue generated by our product review and recommendation website, Wirecutter; and classified advertising, which includes line ads sold in the major categories of real estate, help wanted, automotive and other on either a per-listing basis for bundled listing packages, or as an add on to a print classified ad. 
In 2018, print and digital other advertising represented approximately 16% of our advertising revenues.
Seasonality
Our business is affected in part by seasonal patterns in advertising, with generally higher advertising volume in the fourth quarter due to holiday advertising.

COMPETITION
Our print and digital products compete for subscriptions and advertising with other media in their respective markets. Competition for subscription revenue and readership is generally based upon platform, format, content, quality, service, timeliness and price, while competition for advertising is generally based upon audience levels and demographics, advertising rates, service, targeting capabilities, advertising results and breadth of advertising offerings.
Our print newspaper competes for subscriptions and advertising primarily with national newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post; newspapers of general circulation in New York City and its suburbs; other daily and weekly newspapers and television stations and networks in markets in which The Times is circulated; and some national news and lifestyle magazines. The international edition of our newspaper competes with international sources of English-language news, including the Financial Times, Time, Bloomberg Business Week and The Economist.
As our industry continues to experience a shift from print to digital media, our products face competition for audience, subscriptions and advertising from a wide variety of digital media (some of which are free to users), including news and other information websites and mobile applications, news aggregators, sites that cover niche content, social media platforms, and other forms of media. In addition, we compete for advertising on digital advertising networks and exchanges and real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels, and our branded content studio and digital marketing agencies compete with other marketing agencies that provide similar services, including those of other publishers.
Our news and other digital products most directly compete for audience, subscriptions and advertising with other U.S. news and information websites, mobile applications and digital products, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Vox, Vice, Buzzfeed, NBC News, NPR, Fox News, Yahoo! News and HuffPost. We also compete for audience and advertising with customized news feeds and news aggregators such as Facebook Newsfeed, Apple News and Google News. Internationally, our websites and mobile applications compete with international online sources of English-language news, including BBC News, CNN, The Guardian, the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist and Reuters.
OTHER BUSINESSES
We derive revenue from other businesses, which primarily include:

• | The Company’s licensing division, which transmits articles, graphics and photographs from The Times and other publications to approximately 1,800 newspapers, magazines and websites in over 100 countries and territories worldwide. It also comprises a number of other businesses that primarily include digital archive distribution, which licenses electronic databases to resellers in the business, professional and library markets; magazine licensing; news digests; book development and rights and permissions;


• | Wirecutter, a product review and recommendation website acquired in October 2016 that serves as a guide to technology gear, home products and other consumer goods. This website generates affiliate referral revenue (revenue generated by offering direct links to merchants in exchange for a portion of the sale price), which we record as other revenues;


• | The Company’s commercial printing operations, which utilize excess printing capacity at our College Point facility in order to print products for third parties; and


• | The Company’s NYT Live business, a platform for our live journalism that convenes thought leaders from business, academia and government at conferences and events to discuss topics ranging from education to sustainability to the luxury business.

PRINT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
The Times is currently printed at our production and distribution facility in College Point, N.Y., as well as under contract at 26 remote print sites across the United States. We also utilize excess printing capacity at our College Point facility for commercial printing for third parties. The Times is delivered to newsstands and retail outlets in the New York metropolitan area through a combination of third-party wholesalers and our own drivers.

RAW MATERIALS
The primary raw materials we use are newsprint and coated paper, which we purchase from a number of North American and European producers. A significant portion of our newsprint is purchased from Resolute FP US Inc., a subsidiary of Resolute Forest Products Inc., a large global manufacturer of paper, market pulp and wood products with which we shared ownership in Donahue Malbaie Inc. (“Malbaie”), a Canadian newsprint company, before we sold our interest in the fourth quarter of 2017.
In 2018 and 2017, we used the following types and quantities of paper:

(In metric tons) | 2018 | 2017 
Newsprint(1) | 94,400 | 90,500
Coated and Supercalendared Paper(2) | 14,600 | 16,500

(1) 2018 newsprint usage includes paper used for commercial printing.
(2) The Times uses a mix of coated and supercalendered paper for The New York Times Magazine, and coated paper for T: The New York Times Style Magazine.
