Item 1. Business.
Overview 
Zoetis Inc. is a global leader in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines, vaccines, and diagnostic products with a focus on both livestock and companion animals. We have a diversified business, commercializing products across eight core species: cattle, swine, poultry, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock) and dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals); and within six major product categories: vaccines, anti-infectives, parasiticides, medicated feed additives, animal health diagnostics and other pharmaceutical products. For more than 65 years, we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in July 2012 and prior to that the company was a business unit of Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer). The address of our principal executive offices is 10 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Zoetis,” “the company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (2018 Annual Report) refer to Zoetis Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. In addition, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Pfizer” in this 2018 Annual Report refer to Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. 
Operating Segments
The animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions. This is due to a variety of factors, including: 

• | economic differences, such as standards of living in developed markets as compared to emerging markets;


• | cultural differences, such as dietary preferences for different animal proteins, pet ownership preferences and pet care standards;


• | epidemiological differences, such as the prevalence of certain bacterial and viral strains and disease dynamics;


• | treatment differences, such as utilization of different types of medicines and vaccines, as well as the pace of adoption of new technologies;


• | environmental differences, such as seasonality, climate and the availability of arable land and fresh water; and


• | regulatory differences, such as standards for product approval and manufacturing.

As a result of these differences, among other things, we organize and operate our business in two segments: 

• | United States with revenue of $2,877 million, or 49% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018; and


• | International with revenue of $2,890 million, or 50% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs. 
In addition, our Client Supply Services (CSS) organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties, and our human health diagnostics products, together represented approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Products 
Over the course of our history, we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products, including medicines, vaccines and diagnostics, complemented by biodevices, genetic tests and a range of services. We refer to a single product in all brands, or its dosage forms for all species, as a product line. We have approximately 300 comprehensive product lines, including products for both livestock and companion animals across each of our major product categories. 
Our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the cost-effective production of safe, high-quality animal protein. Human population growth and increasing standards of living are important long-term growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways. First, population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition, particularly animal protein. Second, population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity. Finally, as standards of living improve, there is increased focus on food quality and safety. Livestock products represented approximately 54% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets; increase convenience and compliance for pet owners; and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses. Growth in the companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics sector is driven by economic development, related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care. Companion animals are also living longer, receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. Companion animal products represented approximately 45% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
In addition, our CSS organization, which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties, and our human health diagnostics products, together represented approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In the third quarter of 2018, the company modified the list of major product categories to include a category for animal health diagnostics, which was previously included within other non-pharmaceutical products. The prior period presentation has been revised to reflect the new product categories.
Our major product categories are: 

• | vaccines: biological preparations that help prevent diseases of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts or induce a specific immune response;


• | other pharmaceutical products: allergy and dermatology, pain and sedation, antiemetic, reproductive, and oncology products;


• | anti-infectives: products that prevent, kill or slow the growth of bacteria, fungi or protozoa;


• | parasiticides: products that prevent or eliminate external and internal parasites such as fleas, ticks and worms;


• | medicated feed additives: products added to animal feed that provide medicines to livestock; and


• | animal health diagnostics: portable blood and urine analysis systems and point-of-care diagnostic products, including instruments and reagents, rapid immunoassay tests, reference laboratory kits and blood glucose monitors.

Our remaining revenue is derived from other non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritionals and agribusiness, as well as products and services in complementary areas, including biodevices and genetic tests.
As part of our growth strategy, through our research and development (R&D) group, we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical and biological entities, as well as product lifecycle innovation. Historically, a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species, more convenient formulations and combinations, and by expanding usage into more countries. For example, the first product in our ceftiofur line was an anti-infective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection. Through follow-on studies and reformulations, we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes, as well as other species and regions. The ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands Excede®, Excenel®, Naxcel® and Spectramast®.
The following are examples of our first-in-class and/or best-in-class products that we have launched in recent years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation (listed alphabetically): 

• | Apoquel®, the first Janus kinase inhibitor for use in veterinary medicine, was approved for the control of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis and the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs at least 12 months of age. Since January 2014, we launched Apoquel in key markets including the United States, Europe, Japan, Brazil, and Australia;


• | Core EQ Innovator™, the first and only vaccine for horses to contain all five core equine disease antigens - West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine encephalomyelitis, tetanus and rabies - in one combination, was approved in the United States in 2018;


• | Cytopoint®, the first canine monoclonal antibody to help reduce the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis (such as itching) in dogs of any age, was licensed in the United States in 2016 (and was later granted an expanded indication to treat allergic dermatitis in 2018). Since 2016, the product has been approved in major markets including Canada, the European Union, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil and Mexico. An injection given once every four to eight weeks, Cytopoint neutralizes interleukin - 31, a protein that has been demonstrated to trigger itching in dogs;


• | Fostera® PCV MH was introduced in November 2013 in the United States and approved in the European Union in 2015 and Australia in 2017. It was developed to help protect pigs from porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) and enzootic pneumonia caused by M. hyopneumoniae (M. hyo). The one-bottle formulation of Fostera PCV MH allows the convenience of a one-dose program or the flexibility of a two-dose program. The Fostera franchise also includes Fostera/Suvaxyn® PRRS, which was approved in the United States in 2015 and in Taiwan, Vietnam and European Union countries in 2017. This vaccine offers protection against both the respiratory and reproductive forms of disease caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus. In 2018, Fostera Gold PCV MH was approved in the United States and Canada. This is the only vaccine to contain two PCV2 genotypes and long-lasting M. hyo coverage;

• | Simparica® (sarolaner) Chewables, a monthly chewable tablet for dogs to control fleas and ticks, was approved in the European Union and New Zealand in 2015, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Brazil (Simparic) in 2016, and Japan along with multiple additional European, Latin American and Asia Pacific markets in 2017. Building on this franchise, in 2017, Zoetis received European Commission approval for Stronghold® Plus (selamectin/sarolaner), a topical combination product that treats ticks, fleas, ear mites, lice and gastrointestinal worms and prevents heartworm disease in cats. In 2018, this product was approved in the United States, Japan and Canada (Revolution® Plus);


• | Vanguard® is a market leading vaccine line for dogs intended to help prevent a range of diseases. Since 2016, Zoetis has added new and innovative enhancements to its Vanguard line with Vanguard crLyme, Vanguard Rapid Resp Intranasal, Vanguard B Oral, and Vanguard CIV H3N2/H3N8.

We pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market.” Examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for West Nile virus in the United States and European Union; the first swine vaccine for pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in the United States; the first fully licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the Georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in poultry; a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in the United States; and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help prevent the H3N2 type of canine influenza that emerged in the United States. Additionally, the Pharmaq business of Zoetis is the global leader in vaccines and innovation for health products in aquaculture. In 2018, Pharmaq added to its leading Alpha Ject® vaccine line with approval of Alpha Ject Micro 1 Noda vaccine in Spain, Italy, Croatia and Greece. This vaccine helps protect against Viral Nervous Necrosis, the most important viral disease threatening sea bass in the Mediterranean. Also in 2018, the Alpha Ject Panga 2 vaccine was approved in Vietnam. This vaccine helps protect against two types of bacteria (Edwardsiella ictaluri and Aeromonas hydrophila) that cause significant losses in the Vietnamese pangasius industry.
Zoetis enhanced the portfolio of its diagnostic products with the acquisition in 2018 of Abaxis, a leading provider of veterinary point-of-care diagnostic instruments. With this acquisition came the VetScan® portfolio of benchtop and handheld diagnostic instruments and consumables, which serves a large customer base of veterinary practices in North America and is poised for expansion in international markets. Our diagnostic portfolio also includes the Witness®, Serelisa® and ProFlok® lines of immunodiagnostic kits, which provide disease detection capabilities for various species, including dogs, cats, cattle, pigs and poultry.
In 2018, our top two selling products, Apoquel® and Draxxin®, contributed approximately 8%, and 6%, respectively, of our revenue, and combined with our next two top selling products, the ceftiofur line and Revolution® / Stronghold®, these four contributed approximately 25% of our revenue. Our top ten product lines contributed 40% of our revenue.

International Operations
We directly market our products in approximately 45 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, and our products are sold in more than 100 countries. Operations outside the United States accounted for 50% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, emerging markets contributed 23% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Our international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange control regulations, expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. 
Our sales representatives visit our customers, including veterinarians and livestock producers, to provide information and to promote and sell our products and services. Our technical and veterinary operations specialists, who generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees, provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use. These direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers. Additionally, our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols, including through the use of our products. As a result of these relationships, our sales and consulting visits are typically longer, more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health. As of December 31, 2018, our sales organization consisted of approximately 3,100 employees. 
Our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian. On a more limited basis, in certain markets, we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets, pharmacies and pet stores. We also market our products by advertising to veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners.

Customers
We sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers, including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operations, and to veterinarians, third-party veterinary distributors and retail outlets that then typically sell the products to livestock producers. We primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to third-party veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians, and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners. Our two largest customers, both distributors, represented approximately 13% and 7%, respectively, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, and no other customer represented more than 6% of our revenue for the same period. 
Research and Development 
Our research and development (R&D) operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine R&D organization, research alliances and other operations focused on the development, registration and regulatory maintenance of our products. In addition, we have R&D operations focused on diagnostics, data, digital and other technological innovation. We incurred R&D expense of $432 million in 2018, $382 million in 2017 and $376 million in 2016. 
Our R&D efforts are comprised of more than 300 programs and reflect our commitment to develop better solutions. We create new insights for preventing and treating disease, and maximizing healthy performance, that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation. Leveraging internal discoveries, complemented by diverse external research collaborations, results in the delivery of novel vaccine, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products to help our customers face their toughest challenges. While the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product R&D plays a critical role in our growth strategies, a significant share of our R&D investment (including regulatory functions) is focused on product lifecycle innovation. A commitment to continuous innovation, based on customer need, ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species, more convenient formulations and combinations, and by expanding usage into more countries. We also create opportunities to optimize solutions through our extensive capabilities in biodevice diagnostics and genetics research, ensuring we can help our customers predict, prevent, detect and treat a variety of conditions.
We prioritize our R&D spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our research and business objectives, and do not disaggregate our R&D operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business. We make our strategic investments in R&D based on four criteria: strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio; technical feasibility of development and manufacture; return on investment; and the needs of customers and the market. A centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend. This view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency. The allocation of our R&D investment between product lifecycle innovation and new product development, in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing R&D and other industries, supports a cost-effective, efficient, sustainable and relatively predictable R&D process.
We regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies. Some of our external partnerships involve funding from a non-governmental organization or a government grant. We are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for, as well as investment in, such external partnerships. Depending on the nature of the agreement, we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research, or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models.
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,100 employees in our global R&D operations. Our R&D headquarters is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. We have R&D operations co-located with manufacturing sites in Weibern, Austria; Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Campinas, Brazil; Suzhou, China; Farum, Denmark; Olot, Spain; Union City, California; Kalamazoo, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; and Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. We co-locate R&D operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing. In addition, we maintain R&D operations in Sydney, Australia; Zaventem, Belgium; São Paulo, Brazil; Beijing, China; and Navi Mumbai, India. We also maintain R&D operations in Suzhou, China; Thanh Binh, Vietnam; Hong Ngu, Vietnam; and Oslo, Norway, related to our acquisition of Pharmaq. Each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents, as appropriate.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
Our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by third-party contract manufacturing organizations, which we refer to as CMOs. We have a global manufacturing network of 25 sites.
7 |

Our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites: 
Site | Location | Site | Location 
Campinas | Brazil | Medolla | Italy 
Catania | Italy | Melbourne | Australia 
Charles City | Iowa, U.S. | Olot | Spain 
Chicago Heights | Illinois, U.S. | Overhalla | Norway 
Durham | North Carolina, U.S. | Salisbury | Maryland, U.S. 
Eagle Grove | Iowa, U.S. | San Diego | California, U.S. 
Farum | Denmark | Suzhou | China 
Jilin | China | Tallaght(a) | Ireland 
Kalamazoo | Michigan, U.S. | Union City(b) | California, U.S. 
Klofta | Norway | Wellington | New Zealand 
Lincoln | Nebraska, U.S. | White Hall | Illinois, U.S. 
London | Ontario, Canada | Willow Island | West Virginia, U.S.
Louvain-la-Neuve | Belgium | | 


(a) | In June 2018, Zoetis acquired a manufacturing facility in Tallaght, Ireland where our teat sealant products are manufactured.


(b) | In July 2018, Zoetis completed the acquisition of Abaxis, a leading global provider of veterinary point-of-care diagnostic instruments.

We own the majority of these sites, with the exception of our facilities in Durham (U.S.), Klofta (Norway), London (Canada), Medolla (Italy), Melbourne (Australia), San Diego, California (U.S.) and Union City, California (U.S.), which are leased sites. 
Our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of CMOs. As of December 31, 2018, this network was comprised of approximately 172 CMOs, including those centrally managed as well as local CMOs. 
We select CMOs based on several factors: (i) their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost; (ii) their access to niche products and technologies; (iii) capacity; and (iv) financial efficiency analyses. Our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the CMOs we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality. 
In addition to our global manufacturing network and our CMOs, Pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at three Pfizer sites pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement.
We purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. We utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain, primarily for shipping and logistics support. 
We also have a leased site in Tullamore (Ireland) that we acquired in 2017 where we plan to begin commercial production in the near term. In addition, we are currently investing in a manufacturing facility in Rathdrum (Ireland) that we acquired in 2017, and in building a second manufacturing site in Suzhou (China). Both of these sites are owned by us, but are not yet ready for commercial production. 
We intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization, including Six Sigma and Lean capabilities, which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency. We have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites, and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and CMO sites. As a result of a review of our global manufacturing and supply network, we have exited eight manufacturing sites since 2015.
Competition 
Although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics industry, we face competition in the regions in which we compete. Principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region, species, product category and individual product, and include new product development, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals, pet owners and livestock producers. 
Our primary competitors include animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostic companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health Inc., the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Elanco Animal Health, an independent animal health company as of September 2018, formerly the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG, and IDEXX Laboratories. There are also several new start-up companies working in the animal health area. In addition, we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world. 
The level of competition from generic products varies from market to market. For example, the level of generic competition is higher in Europe and certain emerging markets than in the United States. Unlike in the human health market, there is no large, well-capitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry. The reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity, the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily self-pay nature of the business. In addition, companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians. 
The importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners, veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty. As a result, we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity.

Intellectual Property 
Our technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate. 
Our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 5,500 granted patents and 1,650 pending patent applications, filed in more than 60 countries, with a focus on our major markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the United States, as well as other countries with strong patent systems. Many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our in-house research and development, while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were wholly or partially developed by third parties and are licensed to Zoetis. 
Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained. The active ingredient of Draxxin, tulathromycin, is covered by both compound and formulation patents in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and other key markets, with terms that expire between May 2019 and January 2021 in the United States, between November 2018 and November 2020 in Europe, and between May 2018 and November 2020 in Canada and Australia. Generic tulathromycin products are marketed in countries such as Columbia, Vietnam, Belarus and Russia. Recently marketing authorizations were granted in Europe and there is a pending marketing authorization in Australia. At this time, market entry by generic versions in the U.S. are not anticipated before January 2021. Several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line (Excede) began expiring in the United States in 2015. However, various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024. A generic version of Excede has recently entered the swine market in Mexico. At this time, the market entry of a generic version of Excede in the U.S. is not anticipated before 2024. The compound patent for selamectin, the active ingredient in our parasiticide Revolution, expired in 2014. Again, we have formulation patents covering this product which expire in important markets in 2019. Generic versions of selamectin are now authorized in Europe, Australia and South Korea. The market entry of a generic version of selamectin is not anticipated in the U.S. before November 2019. The patent for the active ingredient of Convenia has expired, however, there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between November 2022 and October 2023. The patent for the active ingredient of Cerenia has expired, however, there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between May 2020 and January 2027. A generic version of Cerenia has been registered in Europe and is marketed in the European Union. At this time, there is no indication of market entry of a generic version of Cerenia in the U.S. Zoetis typically enforces its patents whenever appropriate both within and outside the United States, including by filing infringement claims against other parties. 
Additionally, many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, including by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. 
Following our separation from Pfizer, Pfizer licenses to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field. We license to Pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health. In addition, Pfizer granted us a perpetual license to use certain of Pfizer's product name trademarks. 
We seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product or service. We currently maintain more than 10,000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions, identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals. 
Regulatory 
The sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. In the majority of our markets, the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products. 
United States 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the United States is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), housed within the FDA. All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA's basis for approving a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to the CVM's Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the law. Additionally, we are required to submit all new information for a product, regardless of the source. 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The regulatory body in the United States for veterinary vaccines is the USDA. The USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal health vaccines, including immunotherapeutics. All manufacturers of animal health biologicals must show their products to be pure, safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the agency requirements. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides is the EPA. The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the United States, pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide

authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies. 
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
As a result of our acquisition of Abaxis, Inc., our product portfolio now includes human medical diagnostics, which are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including the 1976 Medical Device Amendments and the Quality System Regulation, and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, and by the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
Outside the United States 
European Union (EU). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is the centralized regulatory agency of the EU, located in London. The agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by healthcare companies seeking centralized approval for use in the EU. The agency has a veterinary review section distinct from the medical review section. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) is responsible for scientific and technical review of the submissions for innovative pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. After the CVMP issues a positive opinion on the approvability of a product, the EU commission reviews the opinion and, if they agree with the CVMP, they grant the product market authorization. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU and European Economic Area-European Free Trade Association states. Products can also be registered in the EU via a decentralized route under the supervision of the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures - Veterinary (CMDv). This co-ordination group is composed of one representative per member state from each national regulatory agency, including Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The CMDv reviews submissions of pharmaceuticals and vaccines for authorization of a veterinary product in two or more member states in accordance with the mutual recognition or the decentralized procedure. A series of Regulations, Directives, Guidelines and EU Pharmacopeia Monographs provide the requirements for product approval in the EU. In general, these requirements are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of, safety, efficacy, and quality/consistency of manufacturing processes. We are also subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that requires us to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the rights of data subjects to request correction or deletion of their personal data.
Brazil. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (MAPA) is the regulatory body in Brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use. MAPA's regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. In addition, regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the Federal Agriculture Superintendence. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicated feed additives. MAPA is one of the most active regulatory agencies in Latin America, having permanent seats at several international animal health forums, such as Codex Alimentarius, World Organization for Animal Health and Committee of Veterinary Medicines for the Americas. MAPA was also invited to be a Latin American representative at meetings of the International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH). Several normative instructions issued by MAPA have set regulatory trends in Latin America. 
Australia. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) is an Australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the Australian marketplace. Previously each State and Territory government had its own system of registration. The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace. Applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the APVMA's scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, Commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments. If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. As well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products, the APVMA reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job users expect and are safe to use. The APVMA also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness. The review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration, or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used. In some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being canceled and the product taken off the market. 
Rest of world. Country-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers' quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. With the exception of the EU, most other countries' regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, EU and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius, in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines. 
Global policy and guidance 
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). They provide a risk assessment/safety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products, exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs. We work with them to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain. 
Advertising and promotion review. Promotion of prescription animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion materials for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products.

Food Safety Inspection Service/generally recognized as safe. The FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including “generally recognized as safe” substances, food additives and color additives), as well as prescribing safe conditions of use. However, although the FDA has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the public health agency in the USDA, still retains, under the tenets of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act and their implementing regulations, the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products. 
International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH). VICH is a trilateral (EU-Japan-USA) program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration. The objectives of the VICH are as follows:

• | Establish and implement harmonized technical requirements for the registration of veterinary medicinal products in the VICH regions, which meet high quality, safety and efficacy standards and minimize the use of test animals and costs of product development.


• | Provide a basis for wider international harmonization of registration requirements through the VICH Outreach Forum.


• | Monitor and maintain existing VICH guidelines, taking particular note of the ICH work program and, where necessary, update these VICH guidelines.


• | Ensure efficient processes for maintaining and monitoring consistent interpretation of data requirements following the implementation of VICH guidelines.


• | By means of a constructive dialogue between regulatory authorities and industry, provide technical guidance enabling response to significant emerging global issues and science that impact on regulatory requirements within the VICH regions.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 10,000 employees worldwide, which included approximately 4,500 employees in the United States and approximately 5,500 in other jurisdictions. Some of these employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements, including approximately 50 union employees in the United States.
Environmental, Health and Safety 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions. 
Certain environmental laws, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment, including at third-party sites or offsite disposal locations, or that currently own or operate (or formerly owned or operated) sites where such a release occurred. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities, private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials on, from or otherwise relating to such a property. 
We have made, and intend to continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation, or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution. In connection with such proceedings, and otherwise, we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites, or financing other parties' completion of such activities. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2018 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activities as follows:

• | environmental-related capital expenditures - approximately $5 million; and


• | other environmental-related expenditures - approximately $15 million.

However, we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties, or those liabilities associated with off-site disposal locations. Such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment. This increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products. 
In connection with past acquisitions and divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us, or may require us in the future, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate. We have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups; however, such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information, or may not be available at all. 
While we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites, we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
