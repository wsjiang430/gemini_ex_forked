Item 1. BUSINESS
Mission
 Leafly’s mission is to help people discover cannabis. We endeavor to serve as the world’s most trusted destination to discover and shop for legal cannabis. The company was founded in 2010 with the objective to demystify cannabis, a product that lived in the shadows through decades of prohibition. Tens of millions of unique visitors access Leafly each year to learn more about legal cannabis, discover what products are right for them, and to shop with regulation-compliant local businesses. Through helping people navigate their cannabis journey, Leafly helps millions of consumers discover the benefits of cannabis.
Business Description
 Leafly began as a platform to provide consumers with trusted cannabis information. Since then, Leafly has evolved into a content-first, community-driven, multi-sided marketplace that connects consumers to cannabis brands and licensed retailers. We offer cannabis retailers and brands subscription-based marketplace listings that provide our broad-based cannabis audience with information, reviews, menus, and ordering and delivery options through legal retailers. Our audience — which averaged 8 million monthly active users (“MAUs”) in 2022 — chooses Leafly for our unique, original content and data.
Our Markets
 As of December 31, 2022, 39 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical use, of which 21 states and the District of Columbia have further legalized cannabis for adult-use. In 2013, Canada legalized the commercial production and sale of medical cannabis, and in 2018 it legalized the commercial production and sale of adult-use cannabis. Several dozen other countries, including Germany, Australia, Mexico and Jamaica, permit cannabis use in some form. Leafly generates revenue in nearly all U.S. states where cannabis is legal for medical and/or adult-use and across Canada. As a content-led marketplace, we have an audience in all 50 states and almost every country where consumers have an interest in cannabis and are able to access our information platform.
Support for cannabis legalization in the U.S. remains strong, with recent polls from Gallup showing 68% support for legalizing cannabis across the country. The support is bipartisan, as evidenced by the States Reform Act by Republican members of Congress, the House's approval of the Marijuana Opportunity and Reinvestment Act, the introduction of the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the passage of the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act after receiving bipartisan support. At the state level, efforts to end prohibition continue to make progress, with New Jersey being the latest to prepare for the launch of adult-use sales, in addition to recent license issuances expanding the medical market in the state.
 Leafly has demonstrated an ability to attract and grow an audience in jurisdictions prior to any form of legalization. We do this by leveraging our extensive content library and establishing brand affinity. Building an active ecosystem with consumers prior to medical or adult-use legalization is a competitive advantage. Consumers consult our strains database and news before legalization, as access to cannabis education and information is generally not restricted, even where cannabis is prohibited. Our high-quality, high search engine optimization, or “SEO,” ranking content library therefore attracts an audience and helps increase Leafly’s brand profile across consumers. Leafly’s platform is broadly available throughout North America, with an audience that reaches beyond North America. The functionality we can provide, ranging from providing content to a robust three-sided marketplace, within each jurisdiction, depends on the state of legalization. The services we provide in any given jurisdiction adhere to the relevant governing regulations, which may allow or restrict online order reservations on third party platforms like Leafly.
Projected Growth of the Cannabis Market
 The consistent growth of the U.S. legal cannabis industry in recent years is expected to continue, with Whitney Economics projecting that the industry is projected to double between 2020 and 2025, and the Pew Research Center reporting that a majority of U.S. adults now support having legal access to medical and/or adult-use cannabis.
Despite these growth expectations, the regulated cannabis market is still nascent and fragmented, with significant challenges facing both consumers seeking to understand cannabis, and the retailers and brands seeking to grow while managing regulatory burdens.
Leafly's Consumers and Suppliers and How We Reach Them
 Consumers
 Leafly attracted on average 8.0 million MAUs to its platform in 2022. While Leafly primarily targets a North American audience, consumers around the world consult Leafly for education and information about cannabis and where and what to buy from licensed retailers and brands. Prevalence of cannabis consumption across consumers has increased in the last 20 years as an increasing number of states and countries have legalized cannabis for medical and/or adult-use.
 Consumers can research cannabis and identify the strains and products that may be right for their needs on Leafly's website. They learn about different form factors and effects, find deals and read reviews, all of which help build confidence in their shopping decisions. We provide consumers with information about the latest strains and products and, more importantly, where they can order those items, from licensed retailers. Our platform also provides a destination where individuals can interact with an engaged community to help navigate the complex world of cannabis and to make an informed and


personalized purchasing decision. Prior to legalization, consumers are already utilizing our industry-leading strain database and reading our cannabis news coverage. When legalization arrives in a particular jurisdiction, we publish news and information about new laws and regulations to help prime consumers for shopping in their new local market.
Consumers access our content, paths towards discovery, and online order reservation tools through the Leafly website and iOS and Android mobile applications. Consumers find their way to the Leafly website primarily through organic search, using search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and DuckDuckGo. Our history of creating useful content has resulted in Leafly search results ranking higher than other cannabis websites for key cannabis search terms. Consumers visit our “Learn” or “Cannabis 101” sections to learn the basics of cannabis science and products; “News” to learn about the latest developments in legalization and regulations; “Strains” to access our strains database; “Products” to access our catalog of cannabis brands and products across multiple categories; and “Dispensaries” to find listings of retailers and their menus nearest to the consumer’s location. Leafly also gathers structured feedback from consumers in the form of reviews, where consumers share their observations and experiences with a particular strain or product.
 To attract consumers to our platform, we leverage multiple business-to-consumer (“B2C”) marketing initiatives, including content marketing, channel and event marketing, and public relations to drive cost-effective consumer engagement. Prior to Q3 2021, we focused on generating consumer interest through our owned channels or earned media. We believe that future deployment of capital towards paid customer acquisition will allow us to grow our visitor and customer base more effectively than organic growth alone.
 Retailers and Brands
 Retailers are the licensed storefronts and delivery services that sell cannabis products to consumers. Brands are the licensed producers of cannabis products or accessories that are made available for sale to consumers. We refer to retailers and brands collectively as “suppliers” on our platform and they are the purveyors of cannabis products that consumers discover on our platform while they search for the right cannabis products that fit their needs. Suppliers participate on the Leafly platform to reach Leafly's engaged cannabis consumer audience and they comprise the paying customers on our platform today.
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 11,700 retail listings on our platform, of which over 5,000 were paid. We believe the greater the number of retail listings and menu items, the more likely it is a consumer will find their desired product or strain. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 9,800 brand listings on our platform, of which an insignificant portion were paid.
Our marketing efforts to attract suppliers include a variety of strategies designed to acquire both retail and brands subscribers. We are working to attract the remaining licensed retailers not already on our platform. We are also using marketing strategies to activate more brands across our platform. Leveraging data insights, technology tools and personalized interaction via events and direct email, we seek to craft messages that resonate for sales and product adoption. Our business-to-business (“B2B”) marketing is transitioning from a primarily inbound lead generation approach to also include proactive account-based marketing designed to reach brands and licensed retailers in prioritized geographies.
Leafly's Products and Services
 Products and Services for Consumers - Content and Shopping Services
 We are a content-first marketplace that seeks to educate and inform consumers about cannabis. Our visitors, also referred to as consumers, in addition to consuming our content, may also create and submit additional content, expanding our overall library. User-generated content can include new strain information and additional reviews, and, once submitted, our subject matter experts may review, validate and add to these submissions. With each new piece of content from our visitors, our content library grows richer and more valuable for all future visitors to our platform.
 We also generate additional content on our platform in the form of retailer listings, which support our online ordering experience. Retailers purchase monthly retailer subscriptions to provide a business listing on our site, where they can maintain basic business information, including address, phone number, and business hours. Listings also allow retailers to upload their menus manually or through an existing integration we have with point-of-sale (“POS”) providers, custom API integrations


with retailers, and integrations with menu enablement providers. Menus provide a list of products that are available through the retailer as well as those product listings that are order enabled.
Brand listings, introduced in June 2021, are also a source of content, through which brand customers provide information about their products, which are searchable and viewable by Leafly consumers. Brands list their products on Leafly so they can provide pertinent product details to consumers, such as strain, cannabinoid, and terpene information, as well as post product imagery. Through catalog control, which launched in the fall of 2021, brands are able to control how their products appear across retailer menus on the Leafly platform, creating a consistent look and feel for their product(s).
Consumers on the Leafly platform can reserve items on retailer menus for pick-up or delivery, where either is permitted under applicable law. Once consumers place a reservation, the Leafly platform communicates the online order reservation to the applicable retailer who is then responsible for fulfillment. Our platform also allows for retailers to communicate with consumers. For example, consumers receive “order received,” “order being processed” and “order ready for pick-up” communications from the applicable retailer, so they can track in real-time the status of their order.
 Consumers access our content and tools for free across the Leafly platform. All our revenues today are generated from our paying retailer and brand partners. Leafly neither sells (nor fulfills purchases of) cannabis products, nor does Leafly process payments for cannabis transactions across its platform. Consumers do not purchase cannabis products using our platform, and all confirmation of product availability, final order acceptance, order fulfillment, and processing of payments is handled directly between the consumer and the retailer.
 Products and Services for Retailers
 Leafly provides retailers with subscription-based offerings and advertising tools to attract our audience to their menus and ultimately, convert that audience into a community of shoppers. We also provide a suite of online tools which allow retailers to engage and communicate with consumers they acquire on our platform, including a portfolio of easy-to-use Software as a Service (“SaaS”)-based tools that allow the retailers to update their menus on the Leafly platform, create deals and promotions for consumers, manage their Leafly order reservation operations, integrate with selected POS systems, and view dashboards and analytics to help them make sales and merchandising decisions. Finally, we provide competitive market insights to retailers, which help them understand product and sales trends in their local market, track and monitor their performance across the Leafly platform, and gain insights on how to better compete to acquire new consumers via the Leafly platform.
 We offer retailers two different tiers of subscriptions on our platform, standard and pro. We also offer a no-cost package that includes retailer informational listings, including store name and address, contact information, opening hours and customer reviews. Our paid solutions provide enhanced business listings, POS integrations, online reservation services, data insights, and advertising. Increasing the number of paid retailers with menus on our platform is critical to give consumers access to a greater supply of cannabis retailers, which creates a more compelling shopping experience.
 The primary difference between standard and pro subscriptions is the ability for pro subscribers to participate in our advertising and add-on activations, including featured listings, display ads, promoted deal offerings, sponsored content, and sponsored event services. For example, on our dispensary finder, we offer platinum placements. These performance ad units typically generate greater consumer activity and engagement with the advertising retailer. In competitive local markets, those marketplace ad units can generate additional revenue for Leafly, as retailers compete to acquire new shoppers and order reservations via the Leafly platform. Retailers may be willing to pay higher rates and compete for shoppers on our platform, as Leafly shoppers exhibit valuable shopping behaviors. The ability to price performance advertising units based on market demand makes our business model dynamic and further empowers retailers to make prudent marketing choices based on their desired volume of consumer engagement.
 Revenue from our retail partners accounted for approximately 77.6% and 78.1% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.



Products and Services for Brands
 Brands have historically relied on our digital advertising solutions, such as banner ads, branded content, and email campaigns, to engage with the Leafly audience across our platform. However, with the re-introduction of our brands subscription offering in the first half of 2021, in addition to traditional digital advertising products that we continue to sell, we now offer a subscription-based product which allows brands to create a product listing on Leafly and pay to participate in advertising and add-on activations to promote their products to shoppers on our platform. We offer brands tools for campaign creation, tracking, and targeting and audience segmentation of customers so they can offer products and promotions that are native to the consumer shopping experience on Leafly.
 Revenue from our brand partners accounted for approximately 22.4% and 21.9% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Competition and Growth Drivers
 Leafly is a three-sided marketplace connecting consumers, retailers and brands who come together on our platform to participate in our efficient, networked marketplace. Participants on Leafly — whether consumer, retailer or brand — contribute rich content, power menus, drive order reservations and, ultimately, increase the velocity of our flywheel. Connecting these constituents with Leafly order reservation tools has resulted in a dynamic marketplace that drives significant value to our suppliers.
We compete with WM Technologies, Inc. (“Weedmaps”) in providing a marketplace where consumers search for products and place order reservations for those products with participating storefront and delivery retailers. However, with our content-first strategy, we are able to build demand (consumers) on our platform in advance of establishing the marketplace. This differentiates us from Weedmaps, which is a transaction-oriented marketplace and, thus, dependent on a legalization trigger to establish a foothold in any given market.
We also compete with e-commerce enablement providers that target the cannabis sector, including Dutchie and Jane Technologies (“Jane”). Providers like Dutchie and Jane provide licensed retailers with embedded menus and e-commerce tools (similar to Leafly’s embedded menu solutions) that allow for retailers to offer e-commerce and order reservations directly on retailers’ websites. Dutchie and Jane also offer consumer marketplaces, but those offerings have limited consumer traffic and engagement as compared with Leafly’s marketplace. In February 2021, Leafly entered into a strategic partnership with Jane to provide streamlined menu management for retailers by integrating Jane's product catalog and business tools with Leafly's consumer marketplace. This integration offers retailers time-saving, resource-efficient tools for online menu management, as well as a larger reach to consumers and customers.
Leafly’s marketplace competes for its share of a large and growing audience. Leafly seeks to offer a differentiated experience for every visitor, powered by educational resources, broad selection, data and science. We believe the breadth of verified information, news and selection establishes trust between Leafly and its audience, creating a competitive environment that favors Leafly. We believe the significant audience and content library we have built up over a decade cannot be replicated easily.
 In order to drive the continued growth of our business, we see a number of clear strategies and growth drivers in the immediate to mid-term.


Increased Penetration of Local Markets
 Because of the highly fragmented nature of state cannabis regulations, cannabis is an inherently local business. Each state has its own rules regarding who, what and how cannabis products can be produced and sold. Leafly has an established local market strategy that is designed to capitalize on the inherently local nature of this market. We focus on establishing and scaling our marketplace on a market-by-market basis. We work to secure the right amount of supply (retailers and brands) so we can match them with the demand (consumers) on our platform. Failure to achieve the right balance between suppliers and consumers can result in a suboptimal shopping experience, where fewer suppliers mean reduced selection and price options for consumers. To achieve healthy marketplace dynamics in specific markets, we may lower the price of our subscription packages to attract retailers onto our platform. We believe on-boarding suppliers onto our platform is of critical importance and will benefit us in the long run. We believe that by improving matching at the local level we can increase the volume of order reservations placed on our platform, thereby driving greater gross merchandise value and return on spend for our participating retailers. We have the ability to recreate this process in most new markets we enter.
Historically and today, our sales efforts to attract suppliers have been primarily focused on processing inbound leads. Many cannabis brands and retailers want to list their businesses on Leafly as soon as they are ready to begin operations. Starting in the Fall of 2021, we began expanding our sales team and later reorganized teams into local market teams, focused on outbound lead generation by local market in addition to inbound. Reflecting a reduction in force implemented in the fourth quarter of 2022, as of December 31, 2022, we employed 34 individuals focused on selling, account management and customer success activities targeting retailers and 15 individuals focused on selling and implementing brand sales.
With the addition of a new Chief Commercial Officer in October 2022, we believe Leafly can expand upon its success in local markets and recreate optimal dynamics to drive our marketplace in new and emerging markets.
Advertising Platform Enhancements
 Performance-based advertising products offered to retailers embed dynamism in Leafly’s business model, as described in the section titled “Products and Services – Retailers” and “Products and Services – Brands” above. Currently, those ad units are priced and offered by our sales teams. By creating more ad inventory and investing in technology to introduce bidding tools, Leafly is able to more dynamically price those advertising units based on market demand. We believe market-based pricing, and greater automation in selling those ad units, present opportunities for revenue growth in 2023 and beyond.
Consumer Personalization and Improved Matching
 In addition to iterating on our offerings for suppliers, we believe that investment in consumer discovery and personalization will provide our consumers with a further differentiated and immersive experience. We expect this will result in converting more Leafly visitors into shoppers. Today, we leverage our content (e.g., strains database, consumer reviews, retailer menus, brand product listings) and intellectual property along with search data and consumer trends to drive recommendations and personalization for our visitors. We continue to iterate on our personalization engines and, through such improvements, we believe we can better match consumers with their preferred strains and products. We believe finding the right product is critical, and we believe consumers will value personalized recommendations as they refine individual preferences. Through improved matching, we believe we can increase the number of order reservations and the number of items within each order reservation and shopper retention. In doing so, Leafly will generate increased return on investment for our suppliers and for ourselves.
New Market Development
 Our long-term growth depends on our ability to successfully develop an online marketplace within each local economy, whether within North America or outside. Once a new market opens with some form of legalized cannabis use, it may take years for that market to become efficient. This requires a robust supply chain, an appropriate density of dispensaries, and enough variety across brands and form factors to power consumer engagement. Our business depends on each market achieving a critical mass of consumers and suppliers, which will drive meaningful ROI to our advertising partners. We believe achieving these elements will accelerate our revenue model. However, it is our strategy to build an engaged audience in certain new markets prior to those markets reaching maturity. As a result, we may continue to generate losses in new markets for an extended period, and different markets can be expected to grow at different rates and generate varying levels of revenue, which we cannot predict with accuracy.
Data Opportunities
 As the industry matures, we will expand our offering of e-commerce tools and, by association, data products. With one of the largest audiences in cannabis, we identify customer trends and opportunities at the local market level. Leafly has amassed significant and unique visitor data on browsing and purchasing trends since its inception in 2010. Our internal data shows us that online cannabis shoppers are relatively higher dollar spenders than in-store shoppers, and we believe this type of consumer will be of interest for advertisers in cannabis-related and adjacent industries. With that data, we expect to increase the efficiency of our advertisers' spend by allowing them to reach a specific audience based on the characteristics of their choosing. We view the ability to offer this data and insight as a valuable potential revenue stream.
 Concentration of Markets and Customers
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, Leafly derived approximately 18%, 12% and 10% of its revenue from customers in Arizona, California and Oregon, respectively. No other state comprised 10% or more of Leafly’s revenue. We have a diversified set of customers; no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Seasonality
 We may experience seasonality in our business, which we believe has moderate impacts on our overall revenue. In certain years, we've seen seasonal fluctuations that coincide with either federal holidays, generally in the fourth quarter, or industry holidays and events, generally in the spring. Our industry and business history is limited and therefore we can't be certain that these are known trends or that other trends may develop.
Intellectual Property
 Our brands and intellectual property are valuable assets that are important to our business. In our efforts to safeguard our trademarks, domain names, inventions, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international rights in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
 We have an ongoing trademark registration program pursuant to which we file to register our core brands in select jurisdictions to the extent we determine they are appropriate and cost-effective. We consider our LEAFLY trademark to be among our most valuable brand assets and have filed or registered this mark in various jurisdictions, including the United States. Federal, state, and/or local laws may limit or define the nature of permitted goods and services for which we can seek registration.
 We hold issued US Patents and have filed and maintained foreign and US patent applications to protect our software, algorithms, and technology interface.
We hold registered and unregistered copyrights, including a registered copyright for our retailer educational program and unregistered copyright in and to aspects of some of our software code, our site content, and our API.
 

We also rely on non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, or license agreements with employees, independent contractors, consumers, software providers and other third parties, which protect and limit access to and use of our proprietary intellectual property.
 We believe our intellectual property rights are a crucial component of, and competitive differentiator for, our business.
 Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 People Operations and Human Capital Resources
 Reflecting a reduction in force implemented in the fourth quarter of 2022, as of December 31, 2022, Leafly had 204 employees. We categorize our company into three teams: sales and marketing, product development, and general and administration. Within those three categories we had approximately 104, 63 and 37 employees, respectively. Of these employees, 194 were located in the U.S. and 10 were located in Canada.
 The opportunity to build and scale the leading cannabis discovery marketplace has attracted, and we believe will continue to attract, top talent across all departments. Our position as a leading cannabis platform in a growing and dynamic market helps us attract high caliber employees who are skilled and also passionate about our mission. We have invested in our talent acquisition resources to find, attract and retain diverse and skilled talent across North America. There are no organized labor unions that represent our employees and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements.
 Government Regulation of the Leafly Business
 Leafly is not currently required to obtain a license for the provision of its products and services to its clients in the cannabis industry. However, Leafly may be subject, directly or indirectly, to rules or regulations governing the provision of such products or services, and the costs of compliance with such rules or regulations may be substantial. As discussed further below, those jurisdictions which have legalized cannabis for medical or adult-use have frequently adopted a complex licensing and regulatory regime. Entities engaged in the growing, processing, sale, transportation, or delivery of cannabis products are subject to rigorous licensing requirements, including initial licensing and regular licensing renewals, and on-going regulatory burdens. We require suppliers to provide proof of valid corporate existence at the time we initially onboard them, or, if we understand that state law requires a separate cannabis license, to submit a valid, unexpired state-issued license number, and we require contractual representations and warranties from our suppliers that they are complying with state law. However, we do not routinely validate whether that license number remains valid during the term of our suppliers’ use of our services and accordingly we generally do not, and cannot, ensure that our suppliers will conduct their business in a manner compliant with regulations or licensing requirements. The costs that licensing and regulation impose on Leafly’s suppliers may indirectly affect Leafly’s operations by increasing the costs of operations for our suppliers, decreasing their profitability or resulting in regulatory and even criminal actions if they are non-compliant, and in each case reducing their ability to pay for part or all of Leafly’s services, by causing them to go out of business, or by discouraging potential clients to enter the market.
 

Regulatory restrictions on our suppliers also may restrict the extent to, or manner in, which they can use our services. In many jurisdictions, licensed cannabis businesses are subject to laws and regulations that restrict the manner in which they can advertise. For example, licensees generally are prohibited from advertising to those under the legal age of cannabis consumption in that jurisdiction. Licensees in many jurisdictions are required to include disclaimers in advertisements. Depending on the jurisdiction, licensees may be prohibited from depicting cannabis or cannabis products in advertising, making health or therapeutic claims about cannabis or cannabis products, or encouraging over-consumption of cannabis, among others. For example, licensees in Michigan may not advertise themselves as “dispensaries,” licensees in Illinois may not include in advertisements any images of a cannabis leaf or bud, and licensees in Oregon may only use advertising that targets cell phones (e.g., hyper-local marketing) if the advertising is within an app the user has installed, the user has confirmed they are of legal age, and the app provides an opt-out feature. These restrictions indirectly affect Leafly by restricting the manner in which its clients can advertise on the Leafly website or Leafly app. In some jurisdictions, licensees may be prohibited from using third-party platforms (like Leafly) for ordering, preventing those licensees from using Leafly’s reservation and ordering services, which are part of our paid subscription service. Jurisdictions change these laws and regulations, sometimes frequently, which may affect Leafly in ways we cannot predict.
 Some jurisdictions have considered imposing licensing or regulatory requirements directly on online service providers servicing the cannabis industry, such as Leafly. For example, in 2019, the California legislature considered but ultimately rejected AB1417, a bill that would have imposed requirements on websites dedicated to promoting cannabis products. Other states may seek to impose such restrictions. Challenging such restrictions or complying with such restrictions may cause us to incur substantial costs.
 We have not been a defendant in a criminal action, nor have we been the subject of a civil or regulatory enforcement proceeding, prosecuted by any governmental authority based on our provision of products and solutions to the cannabis industry.
 Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business
 Our capacity for continued growth and ability to achieve and maintain profitability depends in part on our ability to operate and compete effectively in different domestic and international markets. Each market has unique regulatory dynamics and we have little influence over regulators and the regulations they ultimately enact. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the number of retailers allowed to operate, and our costs associated with onboarding new suppliers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our ability to offer more attractive advertising offerings than alternative options, which affects our sales, results of operations and key business metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in the domestic and international markets where we operate.
 Rest of World
 In most other countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, cannabis is not legal for adult use. A number of countries have decriminalized cannabis or permit the use of medical cannabis, including Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Jamaica and we expect additional countries to do so. However, it may take years for foreign countries to open for the sale of cannabis-related goods and services. In the meantime, while we do not yet regard these countries as viable markets for our products or services, our content is available to viewers in those countries.
Business Combination with Merida Merger Corp. I
 
On February 4, 2022, Leafly Holdings, Inc. (“Legacy Leafly”) consummated a business combination with Merida Merger Corp. I, Merida Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub I”), and Merida Merger Sub II, LLC (“Merger Sub II”), whereby (a) Merger Sub I merged with and into Legacy Leafly (the “Initial Merger”), with Legacy Leafly being the surviving entity (the “Initial Surviving Company”) of the Initial Merger and Legacy Leafly’s shareholders receiving shares of common stock of Merida in exchange for their equity securities of Legacy Leafly, and (b) immediately following the Initial Merger and as part of the


same overall transaction as the Initial Merger, the Initial Surviving Company merged with and into Merger Sub II (the “Final Merger” and, together with the Initial Merger, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity of the Final Merger. As a result of the Mergers, Legacy Leafly became a wholly owned subsidiary of Merida and was renamed Leafly, LLC, Merida was renamed Leafly Holdings, Inc. (“New Leafly”), and the securityholders of Legacy Leafly became securityholders of Merida. We sometimes refer to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the other agreements being entered into by Merida and Legacy Leafly in connection with the Mergers as the “Business Combination” and to Merida following the Business Combination as “New Leafly.”
