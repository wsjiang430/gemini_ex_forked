Our Company
 Shoe Carnival, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest family footwear retailers, providing the convenience of shopping at any of our store locations or online.  We offer customers a broad assortment of moderately priced dress, casual and athletic footwear for men, women and children with an emphasis on national name brands. We differentiate our retail concept from our competitors by our distinctive, fun and promotional marketing efforts. On average, our stores are approximately 10,800 square feet, generate approximately $2.5 million in annual sales and carry inventory of approximately 27,800 pairs of shoes per location.  As of February 2, 2019, we operated 397 stores in 35 states and Puerto Rico and offered online shopping at www.shoecarnival.com.

We are an Indiana corporation that was initially formed in Delaware in 1993 and reincorporated in Indiana in 1996.  References to “Shoe Carnival,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Shoe Carnival, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 Key Competitive Strengths
 We believe our financial success is due to a number of key competitive strengths that make Shoe Carnival a destination of choice for today’s retail consumer.
 Distinctive shopping experience
Our stores combine competitive pricing with a promotional, in-store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and injects fun and surprise into every shopping experience.  We promote a high-energy retail environment by decorating with exciting graphics and bold colors, and by featuring a stage and mic-person as the focal point in our stores.  With a microphone, this mic-person announces current specials supplied by our centralized merchandising staff, organizes contests and games, and assists and educates customers with the features and location of merchandise.  Our mic-person offers limited-duration promotions throughout the day, encouraging customers to take immediate advantage of our value pricing.  We believe this fun and promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales; the building of a loyal, repeat customer base; the creation of word-of-mouth advertising; and enhanced sell-through of in-season goods.  A similar customer experience is reflected in our e-commerce site through special promotions and limited time sales, along with relevant product stories featured on our home page.
 Broad merchandise assortment 
 Our objective is to be the destination shoe retailer-of-choice for a wide range of consumers seeking value-priced, current season name brand and private label footwear.  Our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family.  Our average store carries approximately 27,800 pairs of shoes in four general categories – women’s, men’s, children’s and athletics – which are organized within the store by category and brand, thus fashioning strong brand statements within the aisles.  We engage our customers by presenting creatively branded merchandise statements and signage upon entering our stores. Key brands are further emphasized by prominent displays on end caps, focal walls, and within the aisles.  These displays may highlight a product offering of a single vendor, highlight sales promotions, advertise promotional pricing to meet or beat competitors’ sale prices or may make a seasonal or lifestyle statement by highlighting similar footwear from multiple vendors.  These visual merchandising techniques make it easier for customers to shop and focus attention on key name brands.  Our e-commerce site offers customers an opportunity to choose from a large selection of products in all of the same categories of footwear with a depth of sizes and colors that may not be available in some of our smaller stores and introduces our concept to consumers who are new to Shoe Carnival in both existing and new markets.  Customers who enroll in our loyalty program (“Shoe Perks”) or register on our website receive periodic personalized e-mail communications from us.  These communications afford us additional opportunities to highlight our broad product assortment and promotions.
 Value pricing for our customers
Our marketing efforts attract moderate income, value-conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups.  We believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices, we generate broad customer appeal.  Additionally, the time-conscious customer appreciates the convenience of one-stop shopping for the entire family, whether it is at any of our store locations, online at shoecarnival.com or through our mobile app.  We also believe our fun and promotional shopping environment contributes to a reputation of value pricing.

Efficient store level cost structure
Our cost-efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively.  We achieve low labor costs by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format, allowing customers to serve themselves, if they choose.  This reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales.  We locate stores predominantly in open-air shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value-oriented shoppers.
 Heavy reliance on information technology 
 We have invested significant resources in information technology.  Our proprietary inventory management and advanced point-of-sale (“POS”) systems provide corporate management, buyers and store managers with the timely information necessary to monitor and control all phases of operations.  The POS provides, in addition to other features, full price management (including price look-up), promotion tracking capabilities (in support of the spontaneous nature of the in-store price promotions), real-time sales and gross margin by product category at the store level and customer tracking.  Using the POS, store managers are able to monitor sales and gross profit margins on a real-time basis throughout the day.  Reacting to sales trends, our mic-people use the POS to choose from among a number of product promotions supplied by our centralized merchandising staff.  
 Our centralized network connects our corporate office to our distribution center and retail stores via a wide area network, providing up-to-date sales and inventory information as required.  Our data warehouse enables our merchandising and store operations staff to analyze sales, margin and inventory levels by location, by day, down to the size of shoe.  Using this information, our merchandise managers meet regularly with vendors to compare their product sales, gross margins and return on inventory investment against previously stated objectives.  We believe timely access to key business data has enabled us to drive annual comparable store sales increases, manage our markdown activity and improve inventory turnover.
 Growth Strategy 
 Store portfolio
 Increasing market penetration by opening new stores has historically been a key component of our growth strategy. While our focus continues to be on generating positive long-term financial performance for our store portfolio, we only opened three new stores in fiscal 2018 and do not expect to open any new stores in fiscal 2019.  As we leverage customer data from our Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) program, and as more attractive real estate opportunities become available, we will continue to pursue opportunities for brick-and-mortar store growth across large, mid-size and smaller markets in fiscal 2020. Our CRM program is more fully described below under, “Multi-Channel Strategy – Customer Relationship Management.”   
 Critical to the success of opening new stores in larger markets or geographic areas has been our ability to cluster stores.  In large markets (populations greater than 400,000), clustering involves opening two or more stores at approximately the same time.  In smaller markets that can only support a single store, clustering involves seeking locations in reasonably close proximity to other existing markets.  This strategy creates cost efficiencies by enabling us to leverage store expenses with respect to advertising, distribution and management costs.  We believe the advantages of clustering stores in existing markets will lead to cost efficiencies and overall incremental sales gains that should more than offset any adverse effect on sales of existing stores.
 Over the past several years, we have analyzed our entire portfolio of stores, with a concentration on underperforming stores, to meet our long-term goal of increasing shareholder value through increasing operating income. Our objective is to identify and address underperforming stores that produce low or negative contribution and either renegotiate lease terms, relocate or close those stores. Based on this analysis, we closed 14 stores in fiscal 2018, and we currently expect to close seven to 10 stores in fiscal 2019. Even though this could reduce our overall net sales volume, we believe this strategy will realize long-term improvement in operating income and diluted earnings per share.

As of February 2, 2019, we operated 397 stores located across 35 states and Puerto Rico.  Our stores averaged approximately 10,800 square feet, ranging in size from 4,000 to 26,000 square feet.  New store sizes typically depend upon location and population base, and our stores are predominantly located in open-air shopping centers.  Our traditional store prototype typically utilizes between 7,000 and 10,000 square feet of leased area.  During the past several years, we began to roll out scalable store prototypes that reflect the diverse population densities of our markets.  These scalable prototypes utilize a wide range of leased space based on sales potential and opportunistic space availability.  The sales area is approximately 85% of the typical gross store footprint.

Percentage of store base remodeled | | 1 | % | | 3 | % | 4 | % | | 7 | % | 7 | %

 We lease all store locations, as we believe the flexibility afforded by leasing allows us to avoid the inherent risks of owning real estate, particularly with respect to underperforming stores.  Before entering a new market, we perform a market, demographic and competition analysis to evaluate the suitability of the potential market.  Potential store site selection criteria include, among other factors, market demographics, traffic counts, tenant mix, visibility within the center and from major thoroughfares, overall retail activity of the area and proposed lease terms.  The time required to open a store after signing a lease depends primarily upon the property owner’s ability to deliver the premises.  After we accept the premises from the property owner, we can generally open a turnkey store within 60 days and open an “as-is” store in up to 115 days.  A turnkey store is generally available for immediate use from the landlord, as the landlord performs nearly all aspects of construction and delivers the store in a condition ready for fixtures.  There are typically minimal tenant improvement allowances negotiated with landlords for turnkey stores.  An “as-is” store typically requires more significant capital investment by us, as the landlord performs minimal construction and delivers the space “as-is” while representing that the location is free of hazardous materials.  There are typically significant tenant improvement allowances negotiated with landlords for “as-is” stores.  
 Multi-Channel Strategy
 
We are committed to establishing Shoe Carnival as a world class multi-channel retailer.  The foundation of our multi-channel strategy is connecting customers with our wide assortment of store inventory through multiple channels, while maintaining a personalized, seamless customer service experience.  The Shoe Carnival customer’s shopping journey is complex and rapidly evolving, bridging multiple devices and touchpoints.  We are committed to providing an incomparable customer experience across all channels and believe that our ongoing multi-channel initiatives represent the cornerstone for our long-term growth and are aligned with rapidly changing consumer behavior.  These initiatives are an integral part of expanding our multi-channel footprint and creating opportunities to connect with our customers in new ways.  
 
Customer Relationship Management 
 
In fiscal 2018 we continued to invest in our CRM strategy, which is intended to focus our entire organization on a more customer-centric model.  We engaged with a strategic partner that specializes in creating holistic CRM strategies for large and mid-sized retail organizations to provide discovery, implementation, launch and ongoing support for our customer-centric, multi-channel CRM Solution. This new platform will form the foundation of our CRM program and will also serve as the systemic framework for our Shoe Perks loyalty program and CRM campaign manager.  We expect this initiative will give us an improved view into customer data, allowing us to more effectively communicate with consumers on a personalized basis. Using primarily transaction data, we are gaining useful insights into our customers’ shopping habits, including where, when and how they shop our stores and navigate our online presence.  Additionally, we are gaining a deeper understanding of the brands and categories our high-value customers consistently purchase so that we can continue to deliver strong performance at a geographic and store level.

We believe using CRM strategies will help drive customer retention through segmentation and other analysis and will aid us in gaining a better understanding of our existing customer base as well as identifying new customers.  As we segment our high-value customers through data analysis and target the broader market of customers with similar characteristics, we expect this to play a key role in our growth.  We believe the data received as a result of our CRM program will allow us to better merchandise each individual store, market to specific customers and aid in identifying new store opportunities.  Although a large part of customer data comes from our loyalty program, we take a holistic view of CRM.  We believe this approach should help drive continued Company growth in fiscal 2019 as we continue to enhance our loyalty program and CRM capabilities through exclusive offers and personalized messaging and build even greater loyalty and a deeper relationship with our Shoe Perks customers.  
 
We expect to officially launch our CRM Solution in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  This launch represents the implementation of our production CRM database to support customer information, identity management and our CRM campaign management software.  
 
Ship-From-Store
 
Our Ship-From-Store program is a core element of our multi-channel strategy.  This program allows stores to fulfill online orders and has been implemented on a chain-wide basis (with limited exceptions).  By fulfilling e-commerce orders from our store level inventory, we are able to minimize out-of-stocks, offer our customers an expanded online assortment and leverage store level inventory and overhead.  Additionally, e-commerce orders for certain key items and promotional product are fulfilled from our distribution center in Evansville, Indiana. 
 
Shoes 2U
 
A growing part of our multi-channel strategy is our Shoes 2U program.  This program enables us to ship product from any store to a customer’s home or store of their choice if they are unable to find the size, color or style of a shoe in the store in which they are shopping.  This creates an endless aisle experience for our customers in which our chain-wide inventory is accessible to any store customer.  
Buy Online, Pick Up In Store
 
Another key element of our multi-channel strategy is our buy online, pick up in store program.  This program provides the convenience of local pickup for our customers with the added benefit of driving traffic back to our stores.  
E-commerce and Mobile 
 
In fiscal 2017, we relaunched our e-commerce and mobile storefronts on a new platform designed to improve the customer journey and allow us to provide a more relevant and personalized shopping experience for our customers. We continue to build upon this foundation and plan to add new functionality, including mobile payment options and the ability to shop a specific Shoe Carnival store location, which are planned for launch in the first half of fiscal 2019.
 
Given our desire to connect with customers anywhere and anytime, our mobile strategy is an important component of the customer’s journey and our overall multi-channel strategy. A majority of our customers are accessing our e-commerce site on their mobile devices, and we continue to enhance our mobile web experience to better serve the unique needs of our customers. In addition, our mobile app offers native e-commerce functionality directly from the app and provides Shoe Perks members easy access to their rewards.  Customers also have the ability to scan bar codes in-store to access product ratings and reviews and find extended sizes.

Expanded Online Assortment
 
We implemented a Vendor Drop-Ship program with select vendor partners prior to the fiscal 2018 back-to-school season.  This important program offers our customers an expanded online assortment of styles and colors that we do not carry in-store, and we expect to continue to expand this program in the future.  While our customers benefit from expanded item assortment, the functionality of this program is seamless, and our customers’ online experience is not impacted by the Vendor Drop-Ship fulfillment option.  We benefit from this program by not having to make a capital investment in the expanded inventory assortment, which is carried and fulfilled by the vendors participating in this program.  
Merchandise
 Critical to our success is maintaining fresh, fashionable merchandise at moderate prices.  Our buyers stay in touch with evolving fashion trends and adjust growth strategies based on these trends.  This is accomplished by subscribing to an industry leading trend service, shopping fashion-leading markets, attending national trade shows, gathering vendor input and monitoring the current styles shown in leading fashion and lifestyle magazines. 
 Our buyers and planners have years of experience and in-depth knowledge of our customers and the markets in which we operate.  This helps us select our assortment and quantities in order to manage and allocate inventories at the store level.  The mix of merchandise and the brands offered in a particular store reflect the demographics of each market, climate and seasonality, among other factors.  Management encourages store operations personnel to provide input to our merchandising staff regarding market specific fashion trends.  Our e-commerce site offers customers an opportunity to choose from a large selection of products in all of the same categories of footwear, and introduces our concept to consumers who are new to Shoe Carnival, in both existing and new markets.  Due to our multi-channel retailer strategy, we view our e-commerce sales as an extension of our physical stores.
 Our stores and e-commerce site offer a broad assortment of current-season, name brand footwear, supplemented with private label merchandise.  Our stores carry complementary accessories such as socks, belts, shoe care items, handbags, sport bags, backpacks, scarves and wallets, while our e-commerce site offers certain handbags, sport bags and backpacks.  We purchase merchandise from approximately 160 footwear vendors.  Management of the purchasing function is the responsibility of our Executive Vice President – Chief Merchandising Officer.  Our buyers maintain ongoing communication with our vendors and provide feedback to our vendors on sales, profitability and current demand for their products.  We adjust future purchasing decisions based upon the results of this analysis.  In fiscal 2018, two branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively accounted for approximately 43% of our net sales.  Nike, Inc. accounted for approximately 32% and Skechers USA, Inc. accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales, respectively.  Name brand suppliers also provide us with cooperative advertising and visual merchandising funds.  A loss of any of our key suppliers in certain product categories or our inability to obtain name brand or other merchandise from suppliers at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on our business.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long‑term contracts with our suppliers.

Initial pricing levels are typically established in accordance with the manufacturer’s suggested retail pricing structure.  Subsequent to this initial pricing, our buying staff manages our markdown cadence based on product-specific sell-through rates to achieve liquidation of inventory within the natural lifecycle of the product.  We emphasize our value proposition to customers by combining current season name brand product with promotional pricing.  Our promotions include both advertised limited time sale offerings in addition to in-store and online timed specials.
The table below sets forth our percentage of merchandise sales by product category.

Women’s, men’s and children’s non-athletic footwear categories are further divided into dress, casual, sport, sandals and boots.  We classify athletic shoes by functionality, such as running, basketball or fitness shoes.
 Building Brand Awareness
 Our goal is to communicate a consistent brand image across all aspects of our operations.  We utilize a blend of advertising mediums and marketing methods to communicate who we are and the values we offer.  Special emphasis is made to highlight brands as well as specific styles of product, and visual graphics are used extensively in our stores to emphasize the lifestyle aspect of the styles we carry.  The use of social media has become an increasingly important medium in our digital marketing efforts, allowing us to directly communicate with, as well as advertise to, our core customers.  For fiscal 2018, approximately 47% of our total advertising budget was directed to digital media, television and radio.  Print media (including inserts, direct mail and newspaper advertising) and outdoor advertising accounted for the balance.  We make a special effort to utilize the cooperative advertising dollars and collateral offered by vendors whenever possible.  We utilize television advertising to deliver a balanced mix of both branding and seasonal product messaging across the year beginning with the Easter selling season.  Moreover, it enables us to provide a message of offering value-priced, current season footwear.  
 In addition to a dynamic, lively and fun shopping experience, we offer our customers our Shoe Perks rewards program.  This loyalty program provides customers with a heightened shopping experience, which includes exclusive offers and personalized messaging.  Rewards are earned by making purchases either in-store or online and through participating in other point earning opportunities that facilitate engagement with our brand.  
 We remain highly focused on expanding Shoe Perks enrollment.  In fiscal 2018, we added 2.4 million new members, and purchases from Shoe Perks members were approximately 68% of our net sales.  We believe our Shoe Perks program affords us tremendous opportunity to communicate, build relationships, and engage with our most loyal shoppers and increase our customer touch points, which we believe will result in long-term sales gains.  We relaunched our Shoe Perks program just prior to the back-to-school selling period in fiscal 2018 to better reward our high-value customers and incentivize all of our members in order to encourage brand loyalty.  As part of this relaunch, we added a new “Gold” tier for our high-value customers. Our customers who qualify for our Gold tier receive additional rewards and incentives. The Gold tier represents approximately 35% of our active members and the average transaction value for these customers is 20% higher than non-Gold Shoe Perks members.

We strive to make each store opening a major retail event.  Major promotions during grand openings and peak selling periods feature contests and prize giveaways.  We believe our grand openings help establish the high-energy, promotional atmosphere that develops a loyal, repeat customer base and generates word‑of‑mouth advertising.  Although we do not anticipate any new store openings in fiscal 2019, we expect to continue to pursue opportunities for brick-and-mortar store growth in fiscal 2020.  
 Distribution
 We operate a single 410,000 square foot distribution center located in Evansville, Indiana. Our facility is leased from a third party and can support the processing and distribution needs for up to 460 stores based on our current configuration.  We have the right to expand the facility by 200,000 square feet, which would provide us processing capacity to support approximately 650 stores. 
 Our distribution center is equipped with state-of-the-art processing and product movement equipment.  The facility utilizes cross docking/store replenishment and redistribution methods to fill store product requirements.  These methods may include count verification, price and bar code labeling of each unit (when not performed by the manufacturer), redistribution of an order into size assortments (when not performed by the manufacturer) and allocation of shipments to individual stores.  Throughout packing, allocating, storing and shipping, our distribution process is essentially paperless.  Merchandise is typically shipped to each store location once per week.  For stores within the continental United States, a dedicated carrier, with occasional use of common carriers, handles the majority of shipments.  Our shipments to Puerto Rico are loaded for containerized overseas shipment, with final delivery by a third-party provider.  
 Competition
 The retail footwear business is highly competitive.  We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are merchandise selection, price, fashion, quality, location, shopping environment and service.  We compete with department stores, shoe stores, sporting goods stores, online retailers and mass merchandisers.  Our specific competitors vary from market to market.  We compete with most department stores and traditional shoe stores by offering competitive prices.  We compete with off-price retailers, mass merchandisers and discount stores by offering a wider and deeper selection of merchandise.  Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than we do.  However, we believe that our distinctive retail format, in combination with our wide merchandise selection, competitive prices and low operating costs, enables us to compete effectively.
Store Operations
 Management of store operations is the responsibility of our Executive Vice President - Store Operations, who is assisted by a Senior Vice President of Operations, divisional managers, regional directors, district managers and the individual store general managers.  Generally, each store has a general manager and up to three store managers, depending on sales volume.  Store operations personnel make certain merchandising decisions necessary to maximize sales and profits primarily through merchandise placement, signage and timely clearance of slower selling items.  Administrative functions are centralized at the corporate headquarters.  These functions include accounting, purchasing, store maintenance, information systems, advertising, human resources, distribution and pricing.  Management oversight for e-commerce is also located at our corporate headquarters.
Employees
 At February 2, 2019, we had approximately 5,200 employees, of which approximately 2,900 were employed on a part-time basis.  The number of employees fluctuates during the year primarily due to seasonality.  No employees are represented by a labor union.
 We attribute a large portion of our success in various areas of cost control to our inclusion of virtually all management level employees in incentive compensation plans.  We contribute all or a portion of the cost of medical, disability and life insurance coverage for those employees who are eligible to participate in Company‑sponsored plans.  Additionally, we sponsor retirement plans that are open to all employees who have met the minimum age and work hour requirements.  All employees are eligible to receive discounts on purchases from our stores.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.

Seasonality
 Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores and closing underperforming stores.  Non-capital expenditures, such as advertising and payroll incurred prior to the opening of a new store, are charged to expense as incurred.  The timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout. Therefore, our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre-opening expenses related to the opening of new stores or incur closing costs related to the closure of existing stores.  
 We have three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas.  To prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year.  Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively affect our profitability.  Our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods. 
 Trademarks
 We own the following federally registered trademarks and service marks:  Shoe Carnival® and associated trade dress and related logos, The Carnival®, Donna Lawrence®, Innocence®, Y-NOT?®, UNR8ED®, Solanz®, Cabrizi®, Shoe Perks®, SC Work Wear®, When You Want To 2®, A Surprise In Store®, Shoes 2U®, Laces for Learning® and Princess Lacey’s Laces®.  We believe these marks are valuable and, accordingly, we intend to maintain the marks and the related registrations.  We are not aware of any pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use these marks. 
Environmental
 Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We believe the nature of our operations have little, if any, environmental impact. We therefore anticipate no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for our current fiscal year or for the near future.
