Item 1. Business
Our Company
The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., is a holding company incorporated as a Maryland corporation on May 28, 2015 and substantially all of its business is conducted by its majority owned subsidiary, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC. RMR LLC is a Maryland limited liability company. RMR Inc. serves as the sole managing member of RMR LLC and, in that capacity, operates and controls the business and affairs of RMR LLC. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, “we”, “us” and “our” refers to RMR Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including RMR LLC. 
As of September 30, 2019, RMR Inc. owns 15,302,710 class A membership units of RMR LLC, or Class A Units, and 1,000,000 class B membership units of RMR LLC, or Class B Units. The aggregate RMR LLC membership units RMR Inc. owns represent approximately 52.1% of the economic interest of RMR LLC. ABP Trust, owns 15,000,000 redeemable Class A Units, representing approximately 47.9% of the economic interest of RMR LLC. Adam D. Portnoy, one of our Managing Directors, is the sole trustee of our controlling shareholder, ABP Trust, and owns a majority of ABP Trust’s voting securities.
Since its founding in 1986, RMR LLC has substantially grown assets under management and the number of real estate businesses it manages. As of September 30, 2019, we had $32.8 billion of assets under management and managed twelve client companies. For more information about our calculation of assets under management, see Item 6, Selected Financial Data, included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our business primarily consists of providing management services to four real estate investment trusts, or REITs, whose securities are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, (Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, a Maryland REIT, or ILPT; Office Properties Income Trust, a Maryland REIT, or OPI; Senior Housing Properties Trust, a Maryland REIT, or SNH; and Service Properties Trust (formerly known as Hospitality Properties Trust), a Maryland REIT, or SVC), and three real estate operating companies, or our Managed Operators (Five Star Senior Living Inc., a Maryland corporation, or Five Star; Sonesta International Hotels Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or Sonesta; and TravelCenters of America Inc., a Maryland corporation, or TA).
Until December 31, 2018, RMR LLC provided management services to Select Income REIT, or SIR. On December 31, 2018, SIR merged with and into a subsidiary of OPI (then named Government Properties Income Trust, or GOV), or the GOV/SIR Merger, which then merged with and into OPI, with OPI as the surviving entity. The combined company continues to be managed by RMR LLC pursuant to OPI’s business and property management agreements with RMR LLC. ILPT, OPI, SNH, SVC and, until December 31, 2018, SIR, are collectively referred to as the Managed Equity REITs.
As manager of the Managed Equity REITs, we are responsible for implementing investment strategies and managing day to day operations, subject to supervision and oversight by each Managed Equity REIT’s board of trustees. The Managed Equity REITs have no employees, and we provide the personnel and services necessary for each Managed Equity REIT to conduct its business. The Managed Equity REITs invest in diverse income producing properties across multiple real estate asset classes as follows:

• | ILPT (Nasdaq: ILPT) primarily owns and leases industrial and logistics properties. As of September 30, 2019, ILPT owned 300 properties, including 226 buildings, leasable land parcels and easements in Oahu, Hawaii and 74 buildings located in 29 other states.

RMR Advisors LLC, or RMR Advisors, a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR LLC, is an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which provides advisory services to the RMR Real Estate Income Fund (NYSE MKT: RIF), or RIF, a closed end investment company focused on investing in real estate securities, including REITs and other dividend paying securities (excluding our Client Companies, as defined below).
On August 5, 2016, we acquired certain assets of Tremont Realty Capital LLC, or the Tremont business, which principally originates and manages real estate debt and debt-like financings. As part of this transaction, Tremont Realty Advisors LLC, or Tremont Advisors, a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR LLC and an investment advisor registered with the SEC, was assigned the investment management contracts of the Tremont business. Tremont Advisors manages Tremont Mortgage Trust (Nasdaq: TRMT), or TRMT, a mortgage REIT that focuses primarily on originating and investing in first mortgage whole loans secured by middle market and transitional commercial real estate. 
On July 31, 2018, RMR LLC entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which RMR LLC committed to contribute up to $100.0 million and, on September 1, 2018, ABP Trust contributed $206.3 million of owned office properties to a newly formed private open end real estate fund, the RMR Office Property Fund LP, or the Open End Fund. The Open End Fund is focused on the acquisition, ownership and leasing of a diverse portfolio of commercial office properties throughout the United States. The Open End Fund’s General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of ABP Trust, and RMR LLC and ABP Trust are limited partners of the Open End Fund. RMR LLC provides administrative and property management services to the Open End Fund.
RMR LLC also provides management services to certain related private companies, including Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, an Indiana insurance company, and ABP Trust. We refer to the Managed Equity REITs, the Managed Operators, RIF, TRMT, AIC, the Open End Fund, and ABP Trust, and the clients of the Tremont business as our Client Companies. We refer to the Managed Equity REITs and TRMT collectively as the Managed REITs.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to provide an expanded range of management services to our existing Client Companies, as well as to diversify the number of clients to which we provide services and the sources of capital upon which those clients may rely for growth.
We believe that we have several strengths that distinguish our business from other alternative asset managers:

• | Revenue Base. Our revenues are primarily from fees earned under long term agreements with high credit quality companies, many of which are permanent capital vehicles. Our agreements with the Managed Equity REITs are 20 year term evergreen contracts with significant termination fees payable in certain circumstances. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, fees earned from the Managed Equity REITs represented 90.1% of our total revenue.


• | Cash Flow and Dividend. Our net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 were $169.0 million and $108.4 million, respectively, and we have no debt outstanding. Our prior dividend rate of $0.35 per share per quarter ($1.40 per share per year) has been well covered by our earnings and cash flows. We recently announced an increased dividend rate of $0.38 per share per quarter ($1.52 per share per year), beginning with the quarterly dividend that we paid on November 14, 2019. This new dividend rate remains well covered by our earnings and cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA is a non U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote (3) to “Selected Financial Data” on page 31.

• | Broad Real Estate Experience. We provide management services to a wide range of real estate assets and businesses that include healthcare facilities, senior living and other apartments, hotels, office buildings, industrial buildings, leased lands, net-lease service and necessity-based retail, including travel centers, and various specialized properties such as properties leased to government tenants and properties specially designed for medical and biotech research. The properties and businesses we managed as of September 30, 2019, are located throughout the United States in 48 states and Washington D.C., and in Puerto Rico and Canada.


• | Growth. Since the founding of RMR LLC in 1986, we have substantially grown our real estate assets under management and the number and variety of real estate businesses we manage. As of September 30, 2019, we had $32.8 billion of assets under management, including more than 2,200 properties. The synergies among our clients may also facilitate their and our growth. We assist our clients in realizing investment opportunities by working together to make acquisitions, obtain financing, identifying possible joint venture partners, completing redevelopment activities, and facilitating capital recycling from strategic property dispositions.

In addition, we expect to use our operating cash flow and we may use our equity or incur debt to fund our growth and diversify our operations. Examples of the diversification of our operations are TRMT and our commitment of $100.0 million to the Open End Fund. TRMT is our first mortgage REIT and the Open End Fund is our first private open end real estate fund.

• | Quality and Depth of Management. Our highly qualified and experienced management team provides a broad base of deep expertise to our clients. Our senior management has worked together through several business cycles in which they acquired, financed, managed and disposed of real estate assets and started real estate businesses. As of September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 600 real estate professionals in more than 30 offices throughout the United States, and the companies we manage collectively had over $12.0 billion of annual revenues and nearly 50,000 employees. We have also assisted our clients to grow by successfully accessing the capital markets; since our founding in 1986, our clients have successfully completed over $38.0 billion of financing in over 170 capital raising transactions.


• | Alignment of Interests. We believe our structure fosters strong alignment of interests between our principal executive officer and our shareholders because our principal executive officer, Adam D. Portnoy, has a 51.6% economic interest in RMR LLC. Alignment of interests also exists between us and our Managed Equity REITs due to the manner upon which we earn base management fees and incentive management fees under our Management Agreements with the Managed Equity REITs, as described in more detail below.

We can provide no assurance that we will be able to implement our business strategy or achieve our desired growth. Our business and the businesses of our Client Companies are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 14.

Under each property management agreement, RMR LLC is required to act as managing agent for each Managed Equity REIT’s properties and devote such time, attention and effort as may be appropriate to operate and manage the Managed Equity REIT’s properties in a diligent, orderly and efficient manner.

Term and Termination
The terms of the business and property management agreements with each Managed Equity REIT end on December 31, 2039, and automatically extend on December 31st of each year so that the terms thereafter end on the 20th anniversary of the date of the extension. A Managed Equity REIT has the right to terminate its management agreements with RMR LLC: (1) at any time upon 60 days’ written notice for convenience, (2) immediately upon written notice for cause, as defined in the agreements, (3) on written notice given within 60 days after the end of any calendar year for a performance reason, as defined in the agreements, and (4) by written notice during the 12 months following a manager change of control, as defined in the agreements. RMR LLC has the right to terminate the management agreements for good reason, as defined in the agreements.
If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for convenience, or if RMR LLC terminates a management agreement with a Managed Equity REIT for good reason, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to the sum of the present values of the monthly future fees, as defined in the agreement, payable for the remaining term of the agreement, assuming it had not been terminated. If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for a performance reason, as defined in the agreement, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC the termination fee calculated as described above, but assuming a remaining term of ten years.
The management agreements provide for certain adjustments to the termination fees if a Managed Equity REIT merges with another REIT to which RMR LLC is providing management services or if the Managed Equity REIT spins off a subsidiary to which it contributed properties and to which RMR LLC is providing management services both at the time of the spin off and on the date of the expiration or termination of either of the management agreements.
A Managed Equity REIT is not required to pay any termination fee if it terminates its business or property management agreements for cause, or as a result of a manager change of control, in each case as defined in such agreements.
Business Management Agreement Fees and Expense Reimbursement
Each business management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for (i) an annual base management fee, payable monthly in arrears, and (ii) an annual incentive business management fee.
The annual base management fee generally is calculated as the lesser of:

• | the sum of (a) 0.5% of the historical cost of transferred real estate assets, if any, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, plus (b) 0.7% of the average invested capital (exclusive of the transferred real estate assets), as defined in the applicable business management agreement, up to $250.0 million, plus (c) 0.5% of the average invested capital exceeding $250.0 million; and


• | the sum of (a) 0.7% of the average market capitalization, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, up to $250.0 million, plus (b) 0.5% of the average market capitalization exceeding $250.0 million.

The annual incentive business management fee payable by each Managed Equity REIT, if any, is calculated as follows:

• | The incentive business management fee is calculated as an amount equal to 12.0% of the product of (a) the equity market capitalization of the Managed Equity REIT, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, on the last trading day of the year immediately prior to the measurement period, and (b) the amount, expressed as a percentage, by which the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share realized by its common shareholders (i.e. share price appreciation plus dividends) or the “total return per share,” exceeds the total shareholder return of a specified REIT index, the “benchmark return per share,” for the relevant measurement period, with each of (a) and (b) subject to adjustments for common shares issued by the Managed Equity REIT during the measurement period.


• | The specified REIT index utilized to calculate the benchmark return per share for each of our Managed Equity REITs when calculating the incentive business management fees is as follows:


◦ | ILPT: On December 31, 2018, our business management agreement with ILPT was amended to provide that for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019, the SNL U.S. Industrial REIT Index would be utilized. Prior to January 1, 2019, the SNL U.S. REIT Equity Index was utilized.


◦ | OPI: On December 31, 2018, our business management agreement with OPI was amended to provide that for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019, the SNL U.S. Office REIT Index would be utilized. Prior to January 1, 2019, the SNL U.S. REIT Equity Index was utilized.


◦ | SNH: SNL U.S. REIT Healthcare Index


◦ | SVC: SNL U.S. REIT Hotel Index


• | No incentive business management fee is payable by the Managed Equity REIT unless its total return per share during the measurement period is positive.


• | The measurement period for an annual incentive business management fee is defined as the three year period ending on December 31 of the year for which such fee is being calculated, except for ILPT, whose annual incentive business management fee is based on a shorter period from its initial public offering on January 12, 2018 through the applicable calendar year end.


• | If the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share exceeds 12% per year in the measurement period, the benchmark return per share is adjusted to be the lesser of the total shareholder return of the specified REIT index for such measurement period and 12% per year, or the “adjusted benchmark return per share.” In instances where the adjusted benchmark return per share applies, the incentive fee will be reduced if the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share is between 200 basis points and 500 basis points below the specified REIT index by a low return factor, as defined in the applicable business management agreement, and there will be no incentive business management fee paid if, in these instances, the Managed Equity REIT’s total return per share is more than 500 basis points below the specified REIT index.


• | The incentive management fee payable by the Managed Equity REIT is subject to a cap equal to the value of the number of its common shares which would, after issuance, represent (a) 1.5% of the number of its common shares outstanding on December 31 of the year for which such fee is being calculated multiplied by (b) the average closing price of its common shares during the 10 consecutive trading days having the highest average closing prices during the final 30 trading days of the relevant measurement period.


• | Incentive fees paid by the Managed Equity REIT for any measurement period may be subject to certain “clawback” if the financial statements of the Managed Equity REIT for that measurement period are restated due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws as a result of the bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of RMR LLC and the amount of the incentive fee paid by the Managed Equity REIT was greater than the amount it would have paid based on the restated financial statements.

If the business management agreement is terminated, the base business management fee and incentive business management fee due in respect of any partial period prior to the date of termination will be prorated as provided in the agreement.
In connection with the GOV/SIR Merger, we agreed to waive our right to receive payment of the termination fee otherwise due under our business and property management agreements with SIR, as after the merger, we continued to manage the combined company under our existing business and property management agreements with OPI and continued to manage ILPT under our existing business and property management agreements with ILPT.
Under each business management agreement: the Managed Equity REIT pays or reimburses RMR LLC for all of the expenses relating to the Managed Equity REIT’s activities, including the costs and expenses of investigating, acquiring, owning and disposing of its real estate (third party property diligence costs, appraisal, reporting, audit and legal fees), its costs of borrowing money, its costs of securities listing, transfer, registration and compliance with reporting requirements and its costs of third party professional services, including legal and accounting fees, and as otherwise agreed; and RMR LLC bears its general and administrative expenses relating to its performance of its obligations under the agreement, including expenses of its personnel, rent and other office expenses. Also, the allocable cost of internal audit services is reimbursed by each Managed Equity REIT to RMR LLC.
Property Management Agreement Fees and Expense Reimbursement
No property management fees are payable by a Managed Equity REIT to RMR LLC for any hotels, senior living communities or travel centers which are leased to, or managed by, a Managed Operator or another operating business such as a hotel management company or a senior living or healthcare services provider. For other properties, each property management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for (i) a management fee equal to 3.0% of the gross rents collected from tenants and (ii) a construction supervision fee equal to 5.0% of the cost of any construction, renovation or repair activities at the Managed Equity REIT’s properties, other than ordinary maintenance and repairs. Also, under each property management agreement, the Managed Equity REIT pays certain allocable expenses of RMR LLC in the performance of its duties, including wages for onsite property management personnel and allocated costs of centralized property management services.
Other Provisions
Under both the business and property management agreements, each Managed Equity REIT has agreed to indemnify RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of RMR LLC with respect to the provision of services by RMR LLC, except to the extent such provision of services was in bad faith or fraudulent, constituted willful misconduct or was grossly negligent. In addition, each management agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, will be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement.
Our Management Agreements with the Managed Operators
RMR LLC provides services and earns fees pursuant to a business management agreement with each of the Managed Operators. Under these agreements, RMR LLC provides services to the Managed Operators relating to, or assists them with, among other things, their compliance with various laws and rules applicable to them, capital markets and financing activities, maintenance of their properties, selection of new business sites and evaluation of other business opportunities, accounting and financial reporting, internal audit, investor relations and general oversight of the company’s daily business activities, including legal and tax matters, human resources, insurance programs and management information systems.
Each Managed Operator pays RMR LLC a fee under its business management agreement in an amount equal to 0.6% of: (i) for Five Star, Five Star’s revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, other than revenues reportable by Five Star with respect to properties for which Five Star provides management services, plus the gross revenues of properties managed by Five Star determined in accordance with GAAP; (ii) for Sonesta, Sonesta’s revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, other than any revenues reportable by Sonesta with respect to hotels for which Sonesta provides management services, plus the revenues of hotels managed by Sonesta (except to the extent such managed hotel revenues are included in Sonesta’s gross revenues under GAAP); and (iii) for TA, the sum of TA’s gross fuel margin, determined as TA’s fuel sales revenues less its cost of fuel sales, plus TA’s total nonfuel revenues. In addition, the business management agreement with each Managed Operator provides that the compensation of senior executives of the Managed Operator, who are also employees or officers of RMR LLC, is the responsibility of the party to or on behalf of which the individual renders services. In the past, because at least 80.0% of each of these executives’ business time was devoted to services to the Managed Operator, 80.0% of these executives’ total cash compensation was paid by the Managed Operator and the remainder was paid by RMR LLC.
The terms of the business management agreements with each Managed Operator end on December 31, 2019, and automatically extend for successive one year terms, unless RMR LLC or the applicable Managed Operator gives notice of non-renewal before the expiration of the applicable term. Also, a Managed Operator may terminate its business management agreement at any time (i) for Five Star and TA, on 60 days’ notice and RMR LLC may terminate such agreements at any time on 120 days’ notice and (ii) for Sonesta, on 30 days’ notice and RMR LLC may terminate its agreement with Sonesta on 30 days’ notice. If Five Star or TA terminates or elects not to renew its agreement, other than for cause as defined in each agreement, the Managed Operator is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to 2.875 times the sum of the annual base management fee and the annual internal audit services expense, which amounts are based on averages during the 24 consecutive calendar months prior to the date of notice of nonrenewal or termination.
Each Managed Operator has agreed to indemnify RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of RMR LLC with respect to the provision of services by RMR LLC, except to the extent such provision of services was in bad faith or was grossly negligent. In addition, each agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, shall be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement.
Our Management Agreements with AIC, ABP Trust and the Open End Fund
RMR LLC provides business management services to AIC for a fee calculated as 3.0% of the total premiums paid for insurance arranged by AIC. AIC’s property insurance program expired on June 30, 2019 and was not continued. As a result, AIC has not incurred any management fees payable to RMR LLC since that date. AIC is currently in the process of dissolving.
RMR LLC provides business and property management services to our controlling shareholder, ABP Trust, for which it receives, depending upon the services provided, a business management fee in an annual amount equal to 0.6% of ABP Trust’s revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, a property management fee in an amount equal to 3.0% of rents collected from managed properties and a construction supervision fee in an amount equal to 5.0% of the cost of any construction, renovation or repair activities at the managed properties, other than ordinary maintenance and repairs. 
RMR LLC manages the Open End Fund and receives annual fund administration fees equal to 1.0% of the Open End Fund’s net asset value, property management fees equal to 3.0% of all rents collected from commercial real estate investments, and 5.0% of costs of construction or any improvement at commercial real estate investments held by the Open End Fund.
Our Advisory Agreements
RMR Advisors is party to an investment advisory agreement with RIF. Pursuant to this agreement, RMR Advisors provides RIF with a continuous investment program, makes day to day investment decisions and generally manages the business affairs of RIF in accordance with its investment objectives and policies.

Tremont Advisors is party to a management agreement with TRMT.

No incentive fee shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless TRMT’s core earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters from the date of the completion of the TRMT initial public offering) in the aggregate is greater than zero. The incentive fee may not be less than zero. In June 2018, Tremont Advisors agreed to waive any business management fees otherwise due and payable by TRMT pursuant to the management agreement for the period beginning July 1, 2018 until June 30, 2020. In addition, no incentive fee was or will be paid or payable by TRMT to Tremont Advisors for the 2018 or 2019 calendar years.
The initial term of the management agreement with TRMT ends on December 31, 2020, and the agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms beginning January 1, 2021 and each January 1 thereafter, unless it is sooner terminated upon written notice delivered no later than 180 days prior to a renewal date by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the independent trustees of TRMT based upon a determination that (a) Tremont Advisors’ performance is unsatisfactory and materially detrimental to TRMT or (b) the base management fee and incentive fee, taken as a whole, payable to Tremont Advisors under the management agreement are not fair to TRMT (provided that in the instance of (b), Tremont Advisors will be afforded the opportunity to renegotiate the base management fee and incentive fee prior to termination). The 
management agreement may be terminated by Tremont Advisors before each annual renewal upon written notice delivered to the board of trustees of TRMT no later than 180 days prior to an annual renewal date.
In the event the management agreement is terminated by TRMT without a cause event or by Tremont Advisors for a material breach, TRMT will be required to pay Tremont Advisors a termination fee equal to (a) three times the sum of (i) the average annual base management fee and (ii) the average annual incentive fee, in each case paid or payable to Tremont Advisors during the 24 month period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the date of termination or, if such termination occurs within 24 months of its initial commencement, the base management fee and the incentive fee will be annualized for such two year period based on such fees earned by Tremont Advisors during such period, plus (b) an amount equal to the initial organizational costs related to TRMT’s formation and the costs of the TRMT initial public offering and the concurrent private placement paid by Tremont Advisors. No termination fee will be payable if the management agreement is terminated by TRMT for a cause event or by Tremont Advisors without TRMT’s material breach.
Tremont Advisors, and not TRMT, will be responsible for the costs of Tremont Advisors’ employees who provide services to TRMT, including the cost of Tremont Advisors’ personnel who originate TRMT’s loans, unless any such payment or reimbursement is specifically approved by a majority of the independent trustees of TRMT, is a shared services cost or relates to awards made under any equity compensation plan adopted by TRMT from time to time. TRMT is required to pay or to reimburse Tremont Advisors and its affiliates for all other costs and expenses of TRMT’s operations, including but not limited to, the costs of rent, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other overhead type expenses, the costs of legal, accounting, auditing, tax planning and tax return preparation, consulting services, diligence costs related to TRMT’s investments, investor relations expenses and other professional services, and other costs and expenses not specifically required under the management agreement to be borne by Tremont Advisors. Some of these overhead, professional and other services will be provided by RMR LLC pursuant to a shared services agreement between Tremont Advisors and RMR LLC. In addition, TRMT will also pay its pro rata costs of any combined directors and officers liability or other insurance programs arranged by RMR LLC for public companies managed by RMR LLC or its affiliates and TRMT’s pro rata portion of internal audit costs incurred by RMR LLC on behalf of TRMT and other public companies to which RMR LLC or its affiliates provides management services.
Our Organizational Structure
(In this “Business—Our Organizational Structure” section, the words, “we,” “our” and “us” refer solely to RMR Inc.)
The RMR LLC Operating Agreement
The operating agreement of RMR LLC, or the LLC Operating Agreement, governs the operations of RMR LLC and the rights and obligations of its members. The material terms of the LLC Operating Agreement are summarized below. The summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, reference to the actual agreement, a copy of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Governance
Through our status as the managing member of RMR LLC, we exercise control over RMR LLC and are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of RMR LLC and the day to day management of RMR LLC’s business. No other members of RMR LLC, in their capacity as such, have any authority or right to control the management of RMR LLC or to bind it in connection with any matter, except that members of RMR LLC generally have voting rights in connection with (i) the transfer by us of our managing member interest in RMR LLC, (ii) the dissolution of RMR LLC and (iii) amendments to the LLC Operating Agreement. If RMR LLC proposes to engage in a material transaction, including a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of its assets, we, as the managing member of RMR LLC, have the power and authority to approve or prevent such a transaction; provided, however, that we may not transfer all or any portion of our interest in RMR LLC without the majority consent of the non-managing members of RMR LLC. Currently we and ABP Trust are the only members of RMR LLC.
Distributions by RMR LLC to its members
Pursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement, we determine when distributions will be made to the members of RMR LLC and the amount of any such distributions, except that RMR LLC is required by the LLC Operating Agreement to make certain pro rata distributions to each member of RMR LLC quarterly on the basis of the assumed tax liabilities of the members and in connection with a dissolution of RMR LLC.
Members of RMR LLC, including us, incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their allocable share of any net taxable income of RMR LLC. Net profits and net losses of RMR LLC are generally allocated to its members pro rata in accordance with the percentage interest of the units they hold. In accordance with the LLC Operating Agreement, we cause RMR LLC to make cash distributions to its members for purposes of funding their tax obligations in respect of the income of RMR LLC that is allocated to them. Generally, these tax distributions are computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of RMR LLC allocable to the member multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal and state income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporation (taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income). Additional amounts may be distributed by RMR LLC if needed to meet our tax obligations and our obligations pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, dated June 5, 2015, by and among RMR Inc., RMR LLC and ABP Trust, or the Tax Receivable Agreement.
We are not permitted to cause RMR LLC to make distributions that would render it insolvent. All distributions from RMR LLC are made to the members of RMR LLC pro rata in accordance with the percentage economic interest of the units they hold.
Coordination of RMR Inc. and RMR LLC
Under the LLC Operating Agreement, RMR LLC is permitted to issue additional units from time to time provided that they are substantially equivalent to additional equity securities issued from time to time by us. RMR LLC is generally restricted from issuing additional membership units of RMR LLC to us unless (i) (A) the additional units are (x) Class A Units issued in connection with an issuance of our Class A Common Shares, or Class A shares, (y) Class B Units issued in connection with an issuance of our class B-1 common stock of RMR Inc., par value $0.001 per share, or Class B-1 Common Shares, or (z) units issued in connection with an issuance of our equity securities where the units and equity securities being issued have substantially the same rights (other than voting rights), restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, and (B) we contribute to RMR LLC the cash proceeds or other consideration we receive (less amounts for which we are permitted to be reimbursed under the LLC Operating Agreement), if any, in connection with the issuance or (ii) the additional units are issued upon the conversion, redemption or exchange of debt, units or other securities issued by RMR LLC.
At any time we issue any equity securities, we have agreed to contribute to RMR LLC the net proceeds, if any, we receive in connection with the issuance, less amounts (issuance costs, underwriting discounts, etc.) for which we are permitted to be reimbursed under the LLC Operating Agreement. In exchange for the contribution, RMR LLC has agreed to issue to us (i) in the case of an issuance of Class A Common Shares, an equivalent number of Class A Units, (ii) in the case of an issuance of Class B-1 Common Shares, an equivalent number of Class B Units or (iii) in the case of an issuance of any other type of equity securities, an equivalent number of units of RMR LLC with substantially the same rights (other than voting rights), restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption.
Conversely, if we redeem or repurchase any of our equity securities, RMR LLC will, immediately prior to the redemption or repurchase, redeem or repurchase, upon the same terms and for the same price, an equal number of (i) in the case of a redemption or repurchase of Class A Common Shares, Class A Units held by us, (ii) in the case of a redemption or repurchase of Class B-1 Common Shares, Class B Units held by us or (iii) in the case of a redemption or repurchase of any other type of our equity securities, equity securities of RMR LLC held by us with substantially the same rights (other than voting rights), restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, as the equity securities are redeemed or repurchased.
The LLC Operating Agreement restricts us and RMR LLC from subdividing or combining our or its outstanding equity securities without the other making an identical subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of its corresponding outstanding equity.
If, at any time, any of our equity securities are converted or exchanged into other equity securities, in whole or in part, then a number of the corresponding membership units of RMR LLC held by us equal to the number of equity securities being so converted or exchanged shall automatically be converted or exchanged, as the case may be, into that same number of membership units of RMR LLC that correspond to the number of equity securities issued in such conversion or exchange.
The Class A Units not held by us and our class B-2 common stock of RMR Inc., par value $0.001 per share, or Class B-2 Common Shares, constitute “paired interests.” If RMR LLC issues additional Class A Units to someone other than us, we have agreed to issue to that member an equivalent number of our Class B-2 Common Shares. Each Class B-2 Common Share entitles the holder to ten votes per share, and, accordingly, the issuance of additional Class B-2 Common Shares would have a significant dilutive effect on the voting power of the then current holders of our Class A Common Shares.
Redemption rights of holders of Class A Units
Holders of Class A Units, other than us, may cause RMR LLC to redeem their Class A Units for Class A Common Shares on a one for one basis. At our option, we may elect to pay cash in lieu of Class A Common Shares for some or all of such redeemed Class A Units; the amount of the alternative cash payment will be based on the market price of the Class A Common Shares as determined pursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement. For each Class A Unit redeemed, we will automatically redeem the corresponding Class B-2 Common Share, comprising the “paired interest” for no additional consideration.
Transfers of membership units of RMR LLC
Membership units of RMR LLC are generally subject to restrictions on transfer in accordance with the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement. Under the LLC Operating Agreement, we may not transfer any of our membership units of RMR LLC without the majority consent of the non-managing members of RMR LLC. Under the LLC Operating Agreement, Class A Units and Class B-2 Common Shares comprising “paired interests” may be transferred to a permitted transferee, including Adam D. Portnoy, qualified employees, the immediate family members of Adam D. Portnoy or qualified employees, any of their respective lineal descendants or any entity controlled by ABP Trust or an individual named above. In addition, Class A Units and Class B-2 Common Shares comprising “paired interests” may be transferred by the creation of certain security interests, by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution or in any transfer approved in advance by our Board of Directors.
Indemnification and exculpation
Under the LLC Operating Agreement, RMR LLC has agreed to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, the current or former members of RMR LLC, executive officers or directors (or equivalent) of us or RMR LLC, and current or former executive officers or directors (or equivalent) of us or RMR LLC serving at our request as an executive officer or director (or equivalent) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other entity, except in respect of a matter for which (i) there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter, the indemnified person actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services or (ii) there has been a final, non-appealable judgment or adjudication adverse to the person entered by a court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding based on a finding in the proceeding, in respect of the matter, that the person’s action or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in the LLC Operating Agreement or in any written agreement, the LLC Operating Agreement provides that we, our affiliates and executive officers, the tax matters partner of RMR LLC and the executive officers of RMR LLC will not be liable to RMR LLC or to any non-managing member of RMR LLC for any act or omission performed or omitted by or on behalf of (i) us, in our capacity as the sole managing member of RMR LLC, (ii) our affiliate, in its, his or her capacity as such, (iii) the tax matters partner, in its capacity as such, or (iv) an executive officer of RMR LLC, in his or her capacity as an officer of RMR LLC, except that the limitation of liability will not apply to limit the liability of a person in respect of a matter if (a) there has been a final, non-appealable judgment entered by a court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter, the person actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services or (b) there has been a final, non-appealable judgment or adjudication adverse to the person entered by a court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding based on a finding in the proceeding, in respect of the matter, that the person’s action or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding.
Dissolution
RMR LLC may be dissolved only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the LLC Operating Agreement, including the approval of the managing member of RMR LLC and the unanimous approval of the members of RMR LLC that then hold any units with voting rights.
Tax Receivable Agreement
In connection with the RMR LLC reorganization on June 5, 2015, we purchased Class A Units from ABP Trust. In the future, additional Class A Units may be redeemed by ABP Trust for our Class A Common Shares or cash. We expect that, as a result of both this initial purchase and any future redemptions of Class A Units for our Class A Common Shares or cash, the tax basis of the assets of RMR LLC attributable to our interests in RMR LLC will be increased. These increases in the tax basis of the assets of RMR LLC attributable to our interests in RMR LLC would not have been available to us but for this initial purchase and future redemptions of Class A Units for Class A Common Shares or cash. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we would 
otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. The United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases, and a court might sustain such a challenge.
We and RMR LLC have entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with ABP Trust, the material terms of which are summarized below. This summary of the Tax Receivable Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, reference to the actual agreement, a copy of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we realize as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to our dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of this Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15.0% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that we realize. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing our income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of RMR LLC as a result of our purchase of RMR LLC Class A Units and the future redemptions, if any, and had we not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced on June 5, 2015 and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated upon a change of control or upon certain breaches of the agreement that we fail to cure in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
ABP Trust will not reimburse us for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, we may make payments to ABP Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our cash tax savings. While the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions, the price of our Class A Common Shares at the time of the redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that, as a result of the size of the increases of the tangible and intangible assets of RMR LLC attributable to our interests in RMR LLC, during the expected term of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the payments that we may make to ABP Trust could be substantial. Payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement are required to be made within 80 days of the filing of our tax returns. Because we generally expect to receive the tax savings prior to making the cash payments to the redeeming holders of Class A Units, we do not expect the cash payments to have a material impact on our liquidity.
The Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain changes of control and certain breaches of the agreement that we fail to cure in accordance with the terms of the agreement, our obligations with respect to exchangeable Class A Units will be accelerated. In those circumstances, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits described in the Tax Receivable Agreement, and that any Class A Units that have not been redeemed will be deemed redeemed for the market value of our Class A Common Shares at the time of the change of control or breach, as applicable. It is possible, in these circumstances, that the cash tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments. 
Regulation
We and our Client Companies are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and non-U.S. governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions upon the ways in which we and our Client Companies do business including various requirements for public disclosure of our and their activities.
The Managed REITs have qualified and expect to continue to qualify to be taxed as real estate investment trusts under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition, the Managed Equity REITs generally distribute, and TRMT is expected to generally distribute, 100.0% of their taxable income to avoid paying corporate federal income taxes; and as REITs, such companies must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90.0% of their taxable income. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT status, including share ownership tests and assets and gross income composition tests. If a Managed REIT fails to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if a Managed REIT qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to state and local income taxes and to federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income.
Certain of our Client Companies own or operate healthcare and senior living properties. These companies are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulation that are subject to frequent and material changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing laws. Some of the revenues received by these companies are paid by governmental programs which are also subject to periodic and material changes.
Certain of our Client Companies own and operate hotels and some provide dining, food and beverage services, including the sale of alcoholic beverages. The operation of such properties is subject to numerous regulations by various governmental entities.
TA is also required to comply with federal and state regulations regarding the storage and sale of petroleum and natural gas products and franchising of petroleum retailers. In addition, as a result of TA’s involvement in gaming operations, TA and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to gaming regulations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania; and because SVC owns TA properties where gaming occurs, SVC is also subject to gaming regulations in some of those jurisdictions.
RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors is each registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Advisers Act. RMR Advisors provides investment advisory and administrative services to RIF. RIF is a closed end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. In addition to providing investment advisory services to TRMT, Tremont Advisors also provides investment advisory services to private funds and separately managed accounts that principally make commercial real estate debt investments. The Tremont business may also act as transaction originators for its non-investment advisory clients. These activities result in certain aspects of our asset management business being supervised by the SEC and requires our compliance with numerous obligations, including record keeping requirements, operational procedures and disclosure obligations. TRMT intends to conduct its business in a manner that does not require its registration under the Investment Company Act and, to do so, may rely on any available exemption from registration, or exclusion from the definition of “investment company,” under the Investment Company Act. To maintain this exemption from registration, TRMT will be required to ensure the composition of its portfolio complies with certain tests.
The ownership and operation of real estate properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Certain of our Client Companies own real estate, and we may be responsible for compliance with some of these environmental protection laws.
While we incur significant expense to comply with the various regulations to which we and our Client Companies are subject, we do not believe that existing statutes and regulations have had a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Competition
The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our continued growth will depend upon our ability to manage or assist our Client Companies in an effective manner and identify and execute on opportunities to expand our services to new clients and new sources of capital. 
Our existing Client Companies face significant competition in their respective sectors or industries. The Managed Equity REITs and the Open End Fund compete on a national and regional basis with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, commercial and investment banking firms, private institutional funds, private equity funds and other investors. Five Star competes with numerous other companies that provide senior living services, including home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Sonesta competes with other hotel operators and franchisors. TA competes on a national and local basis with companies operating travel centers, as well as retailers operating in the convenience store and retail gas station industries and in the restaurant business. TRMT competes on a national and regional basis with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including funds or investors that we or our affiliates may sponsor, advise or manage), banks, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions. 
We compete with other businesses in the real estate management and asset management businesses. Many of these competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we or our Client Companies have. Such competitors may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, greater business scale and enhanced operating efficiencies. Certain competitors may also be subject to different regulatory 
regimes or rules that may allow them more flexibility or better access to pursue potential investments and raise capital for themselves or their managed companies. In addition, certain competitors may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities. Our ability and the ability of our Client Companies to continue to compete effectively will depend in large part upon the ability to attract, retain and motivate employees.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, RMR LLC employed approximately 600 real estate professionals in more than 30 offices throughout the United States, and the companies managed by RMR LLC collectively had nearly 50,000 employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, but certain employees of our Client Companies are.
Internet Website
Our internet website address is www.rmrgroup.com. We make available, free of charge, through the “Investors & Media” section of our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Any material we file with or furnish to the SEC is also maintained on the SEC website (sec.gov).
The information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other documents we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. We intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Such disclosures will be included on our website in the “Investors & Media” section. Accordingly, investors should monitor such portions of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We expect to take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company.
We can remain an emerging growth company up to September 30, 2021, unless we:

• | have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues in a fiscal year;


• | issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period; or


• | become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, which would occur after: (i) we have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act; (ii) we have been a company reporting with the SEC for at least 12 months; and (iii) the market value of our common shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.

Based on the current market value of our non-affiliated public float of our Class A Common Shares, we currently expect that we may cease to be an emerging growth company as of September 30, 2020.
