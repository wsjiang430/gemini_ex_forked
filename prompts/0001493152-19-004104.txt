ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Background
 
We are a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of a unique delivery platform utilizing vaporization of various natural compounds for multiple health, beauty and wellness applications. Our delivery platform is proprietary and patented.
 
Our current product offering includes Novokid® - an innovative home use device which vaporizes a natural, plant-based, pesticides, and silicone-free compound that effectively treats head lice and eggs. Following our soft launch of Novokid® in the Netherlands, we expanded our distribution network and launched Novokid in Israel during late May 2018 through Super Pharm, Israel’s largest and leading drugstore chain. The launch was accompanied by a radio and digital brand awareness and marketing campaign and supported by Meditrend, our Israeli distributor, specializing in health and wellness products while representing leading brands.
 
We intend to expand our sales points in Israel and began selling our products in additional pharmacies and various online outlets during 2019. As we remain focused on increasing our global footprint and expanding our distribution network, we showcased Novokid® and met potential distributors and partners at CPhI Worldwide, a renowned and leading pharma tradeshow held in Madrid during October 2018. Accordingly, we are exploring various opportunities to sign agreements with distributors in Europe within the coming months. We are also working on erecting an automated production line which is expected to ramp up our manufacturing capacity while reducing its costs.
 
We believe that we will need to raise up to $2,000 thousand during the next 12 months in order to successfully implement our business plan, of which there can be no assurance. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms, if at all, when needed, may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our products development efforts and secure regulatory approvals and would adversely impact our planned research and development efforts in connection with our future products, which may make it more difficult for us to attain profitability.

On February 8, 2016, we signed a Merger Agreement, or the Merger Agreement, with Novomic Ltd., or Novomic, a private company organized under the laws of the State of Israel and a Shareholders’ Agreement with the Novomic’s shareholders, or the Shareholders’ Agreement. The Merger Agreement was by and between the Company, on the one hand, and Novomic together with YMY Industry Ltd., or YMY, and Microdel Ltd. or Microdel, the latter two of which are hereinafter referred to as the “Novomic Founders,” on the other hand. On August 9, 2016, we consummated the merger under the Merger Agreement and Novomic became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Upon closing of the merger, the former Novomic shareholders owned approximately 73.52% of our capital stock and TechCare stockholders retained approximately 26.48% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, while TechCare was the legal acquirer, Novomic was treated as the acquiring company in the merger for accounting purposes, and the merger was accounted for as a reverse merger as described in note 1 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are included within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, the financial statements of the Company prior to the merger date are the historical financial statements of Novomic, whereas the financial statements of the Company after the merger date reflect the results of the operations of Novomic and Techcare on a combined basis.
 
In connection with the closing of the Merger Agreement, the Company (i) changed its name from BreedIT Corp. to TechCare Corp.; (ii) the 149,219,173 outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock were subject to a reverse split on a one-for-thirty (1:30) basis, resulting in 4,973,972 outstanding shares of common stock; and (iii) authorized ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001, which may be issued in one or more classes or series, having such designations, preferences, privileges and rights as our board of directors may determine.
 
Novomic was incorporated as a private limited liability Company in Israel in 2009. Since inception, Novomic has been a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of a platform that vaporizes liquids from a contained capsule into a treatment area, utilizing its proprietary intellectual property rights.
 
Our Treatment Solutions
 
Novokid® – Natural, Plant-based and Effective Lice Treatment
 
Parents and children exposed to head lice are now forced to use standard over-the-counter, or OTC, treatments that are toxic, often ineffective, time consuming and expensive. According to the Journal of Medical Entomology, 98% of lice have developed resistance to existing treatments in the US and they are now referred to as “super-lice”. Most current treatments contain pesticides, alcohol or silicone, which are all associated with a wide variety of hazardous side effects.
 
Novokid® is a non-pesticide, natural, plant-based and eco-friendly solution that eliminates lice and super lice with a 10 minute dry treatment. This compares with current treatments that require 20-40 minutes of shampooing and combing. Our treatment is fast, dry, clean, and easily administered at home or on the go. Novokid® can also be used as a maintenance treatment if used regularly.
 
Shine – Natural Haircare rejuvenation
 
Shine uses a patented vaporization process and formulation to clean, treat and improve the appearance of the hair and scalp. In addition to removing the residue, the treatments balance the hair’s pH levels, add body and shine, define curls, and strengthen and protect hair from further damage. We believe that the Shine treatment is user friendly, requiring the user to connect the Using Shine capsule to a designated tube, place the attached cap on their head and sit for a 10-minute treatment. There is no need to rinse or shampoo following the treatment. The treatment is expected to cleanse the scalp and leave the hair shiny and manageable.

According to a report published by Mordor Intelligence, the global hair care was valued at $95.45 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $116 billion by 2024, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.35%. We are looking to establish a presence in the home treatment niche. To that end, we are in the process of expanding the Shine treatment product line to include formulations for the needs of specific hair types, such as dry, curly, colored, and over-processed hair.

We may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals for our head lice treatment platform and any future products. If unable to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, our business will be adversely affected. CE approval, which was already obtained for our Novokid® product, is required for the marketing, distributing and sale of our products in the European Union, whereas FDA approval is required for such marketing, distributing and sale in the United States. In the event that our products are to be sold in certain territories requiring additional regulatory approvals, such approvals will need to be obtained by us or by our distributors.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
While the vaporizer for both Novokid® and Shine is designated to be a one-time purchase, the head cap and the capsules, will be sold separately based on the “razor-razor blade” business model (the initial sale of the intro kit accompanied by the recurring sales of the capsules and head cap). Based on our estimates, which we believe are both reasonable and conservative, our target customers are expected to purchase between 12-16 capsule units per year. Therefore, we estimate that the majority of our revenues will be generated in the future based on capsules sales for both Novokid® and Shine products.
 
The Company plans to focus its initial sales and marketing efforts for Novokid® on the European Union where CE approval was obtained in the third quarter of 2017, and once the FDA approval for the Novokid® product is received, also the United States. For Shine, the Company will focus on the Asian and U.S. markets.
 
In order to achieve our intended global footprint and market presence, we plan to base our primary distribution method on the distribution model, in which the distributor will sell our products under our name and branding. In specific instances, we will consider implementing the OEM model, in which the distributor will sell our products under a co-branding arrangement. We believe that these models will reduce our marketing costs to a minimum while starting to generate revenues to support our research and development efforts for utilizing our technological platform to expand our product line.
 
In addition, in January 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Chinese partner for the formation of a Chinese joint venture intended to focus on the development of comprehensive and broad range of health, wellness, beauty and home products for customers by utilizing our patented technology of vaporization of natural and plant-based compounds. The joint venture intends to sell its products in the Greater China region, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, directly or through others. We are currently working with our Chinese Partner on the formation of the Chinese joint venture entity.
 
The Company also plans to market and advertise its products through implementing an omni-channel strategy, both through online and retail sales outlets, which we believe will present a significant opportunity for generating sales and market acceptance.
 
Production
 
We manufacture our products through third party manufacturers in Israel and China. The Novokid® vaporizer is manufactured in China by a local manufacturer, which also handles assembly, integration and quality assurance for the vaporizer and manufactures the cap and the ancillary components of the Novokid® kit. The Novokid® treatment capsules are manufactured and filled in Israel by third party contractors. We are working with our contractors to erect an automated production and assembly line, which we expect to increase our manufacturing capacity as well as reduce its costs.
Research and Development
 
We incurred $571 thousand on research and development during the past two years. During this period, the Company completed the development of the Novokid® and we expect to complete the development of the Shine product in the first half of 2019. The design includes finalization of commercial design of the compressor, capsules and head cap and optimizing the products’ efficiency.
 
We plan to build upon the research and development achievements we had with the completion of the Novokid® product for head lice treatment as the basis to expand our variety of treatments and medical, beauty and wellness solutions, which will also be based on our vaporization platform and the knowledge we gained during the past years.

We are working on a new and proprietary capsule (patent-pending) which will enable a wider variety of future applications for our delivery platform.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Due to the importance of patents, we devoted significant efforts and resources and will continue to invest resources in strengthening our patent portfolio. Below is the list of patents we have registered to date:

Patents | Jurisdiction | Each patent’s relevance to the program | Date and status of registration 
--------------------+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------
EP 2 438 830 B1 | EU | Treating lice with gaseous compounds in airtight space. | Approved on July 16, 2014 
US 9/307820 B2 | U.S. | Treating lice with gaseous compounds in airtight space. | Approved on April 12, 2016 
US 15/438842 | U.S. | Treating an object with gaseous compounds in an airtight space. | February 22, 2017 *

* Under approval process.
 
We plan to expand our existing patents to encompass additional applications.
 
Competition
 
Novokid®
 
In the key markets (i.e. the United States and Europe) in which we compete, our competition ranges from prescription and OTC treatments, many of which are well-established and accepted in the market, to simple home remedies, which include occlusive agents, such as “petrolatum shampoo,” mayonnaise, butter or margarine, herbal oils, and olive oil, applied to suffocate lice. These home remedies, while widely used, have not been evaluated for effectiveness in randomized controlled trials. To date, with respect to occlusive agents, only anecdotal information is available concerning their effectiveness.
 
At present, in Israel, there are three brands which are dominating the lice treatment market. However, the active ingredients in these pharmacological therapies are mostly based on chemical insecticides or silicone. A major problem that chemical-based solutions (mainly pyrethroids) now face is that a growing amount of head lice have developed gene mutations that made them resistant to pyrethroids (those lice are being referred in the common population as “Super Lice”). Pyrethroids are the family of insecticides used to kill lice in common over-the-counter treatment products.
 
During our research, we found that no product on the market today provides a complete solution comparable to our treatment, which we believe places us in position to succeed in the head lice treatment market. Our treatment is designed to create an isolate, controlled environment around the head lice-infested area, in-which a vapor concentration of acetic acid is created, which will be fatal for lice and their eggs, but harmless to the skin and hair of the patient.
 
Shine
 
In the key markets (i.e. the United States, Europe and China) in which we compete, we have not identified a direct competitor utilizing the mechanism or technology similar to those employed by Shine, which is unique and innovative. Dry shampoos and other shine related cosmetic products can be regarded as indirect competitors.
Seasonality
 
It is unlikely that all head lice infestations can be prevented because children come into head-to-head contact with each other frequently, whether in school or in other environments where they are together. As a result, head-lice incidence primarily occur during the school year and during the summer camps. Therefore, we expect strong demand for our product throughout the year with minor or no seasonality fluctuations.

Social and Economic Factors
 
Schools in the United States, Canada, and Australia commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed. This could have major social implications on both the children and the parents that are required on a day’s notice to cease their day-to-day activities and focus on their child’s head lice problem. To save time and for better results, we believe that people will readily accept and use the latest technology and cost efficient product represented by our treatment.
 
Israel, our home base country, had a corporate tax rate of 23% in 2018 and has signed tax treaties with many countries to reduce export and import tariffs. We believe that this export friendly policy in Israel will help our business because we will be manufacturing the capsules, which are the main component of the products, in Israel, for export to the United States, Canada and countries of European Union with the collective market.
 
According to a report published by Market Research Future, the global lice treatment market is expected to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% during the forecast period of 2018 to 2023. High prevalence of head lice and growing children population majorly drives the market. Moreover, factors such as increasing disposable income and rising healthcare expenditure provides suitable boost for the market growth. Contrary to the foregoing, we believe that lack of awareness and low per capita healthcare expenditure in the developing and low-income countries restricts market growth.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our head lice treatment is subject to regulation by and approval from CE and the FDA. European Union regulations specify that treatments for human diseases be classified either as a medicinal product or a medical device. Pediculosis (head lice) treatments fall into both categories. The European Union defines three different classes of pediculosis treatments:
 
1. Those that act via pharmacologically active ingredients (such as insecticides like pyrethrum extract, organophosphates or carbamates). These are classified as medicinal products. Such treatments have to overcome possibilities of resistance and toxicity (for example, the phasing out of linden in Europe over topological and environmental concerns).
 
2. A more recent class of treatments are those that act via a physical mechanism, as opposed to a chemical one. These are classified as medical devices and include silicone oil-based treatments such as dimeticones. By contrast to the former class of treatments, these are non-toxic to humans and are not likely to suffer from problems of resistance.
 
3. The third class of treatments are those which are based on essential oils and herbal extracts. Efficacy claims for such treatments have been advanced under both chemical and physical headings: they are mostly registered as medical devices.
 
During the third quarter of 2017, we have obtained a CE approval for our Novokid® solution, classified as a Class I medical device.
 
FDA approved treatments for head lice include both OTC products and prescription drugs, such as Nix and Rid, in the form of shampoos, creams and lotions. However, many head lice products are not for use in children under the age of two. Although OTC drugs are available for treatment of head lice, health care professionals often prescribe drugs approved by the FDA, such as Ulesfia (approved in 2009), Natroba (approved in 2011) or Sklice (approved in 2012) for the treatment of head lice.
 
With respect to obtaining FDA approval, we have entered into an OEM Agreement, according to which the OEM distributor will manufacture, distribute and sell the Company’s Novokid® head lice treatment products, in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica and Colombia, all on an exclusive basis. Under this OEM Agreement, the OEM distributor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining FDA approval and shall bear all costs related to such approval. Our OEM distributor is currently communicating with the FDA regarding Novokid®’s designation as a Medical Device. A Pre-Request for Designation (Pre-RFD) application was submitted to the FDA by our OEM Distributor outlining the product’s description, usage and benefits, in order to have it designated as a medical device. The FDA’s reply to our Pre-RFD is currently reviewed by our OEM Distributor and by us.
