Item 1. | Business.

General
We are North America’s largest provider of deathcare products and services, with a network of funeral service locations and cemeteries unequaled in geographic scale and reach. At December 31, 2018, we operated 1,481 funeral service locations and 481 cemeteries (including 286 funeral service/cemetery combination locations), which are geographically diversified across  44 states, eight Canadian provinces, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
We are well known for our Dignity Memorial® brand, North America's first transcontinental brand of deathcare products and services. Our other brands include Dignity Planning™, National Cremation Society®, Advantage® Funeral and Cremation Services, Funeraria del Angel™, Making Everlasting Memories®, Neptune Society™ and Trident Society™. Our funeral service and cemetery operations consist of funeral service locations, cemeteries, funeral service/cemetery combination locations, crematoria, and other related businesses, which enable us to serve a wide array of customer needs. We sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at the time of need and on a preneed basis.
History
We were incorporated in Texas in July of 1962. Our original business plan was based on efficiencies of scale, specifically reducing overhead costs by sharing resources such as preparation services, back office administration support, transportation, and personnel among funeral service locations in a business “cluster.” After proving the plan’s effectiveness in Houston in the early 1960s, we set out to apply this operating strategy through the acquisition of deathcare businesses in other markets over the next three decades. Beginning in 1993, we expanded beyond North America, acquiring major deathcare companies in Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, plus smaller holdings in other European countries and South America.
During the mid to late 1990s, acquisitions of deathcare facilities became extremely competitive, resulting in increased prices for acquisitions and substantially reduced returns on invested capital. In 1999, we significantly reduced our level of acquisition activity and over the next several years implemented various initiatives to pay down debt, increase cash flow, reduce overhead costs, increase efficiency, and leverage our scale. We divested our international businesses and many North American funeral service locations and cemeteries that were either underperforming or did not fit within our long-term strategy. At the same time, we began to capitalize on the strength of our network by introducing to North America the first transcontinental brand of deathcare services and products — Dignity Memorial® (see www.dignitymemorial.com). Information contained on our website is not part of this report.
In late 2006, having arrived at a position of significant financial strength and improved operating efficiency, we acquired the then second largest company in the North American deathcare industry, Alderwoods Group. In early 2010, we acquired the then fifth largest company in the North American deathcare industry, Keystone North America. In June of 2011, we acquired 70% of the outstanding shares of The Neptune Society, Inc. (Neptune), which is the nation's largest direct cremation organization, now known as SCI Direct. Subsequently, in 2013 and 2014, we acquired the remaining 30% of the outstanding shares of Neptune. In December 2013, we purchased Stewart Enterprises, Inc. (Stewart), the then second largest operator of funeral service locations and cemeteries in North America.
Funeral and Cemetery Operations
Our funeral service and cemetery operations consist of funeral service locations, cemeteries, funeral service/cemetery combination locations, crematoria, and other related businesses. See Note 12 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for financial information about our business segments and geographic areas.
We have the largest number of combination locations in North America. Funeral service/cemetery combination locations are those businesses in which a funeral service location is physically located within or adjoining a cemetery that we own. Combination locations allow certain facility, personnel, and equipment costs to be shared between the funeral service location and cemetery locations. Such combination facilities typically can be more cost competitive and have higher gross margins than if the funeral and cemetery operations are operated separately. Combination locations also create synergies between funeral and cemetery preneed sales force personnel and give families added convenience to purchase both funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at a single location. 
Funeral service locations provide all professional services related to funerals and cremations, including the use of funeral home facilities and motor vehicles, arranging and directing services, removal, preparation, embalming, cremations, memorialization, and catering. Funeral merchandise, including burial caskets and related accessories, urns and other cremation receptacles, outer burial containers, flowers, online and video tributes, stationery products, casket and cremation memorialization products, travel protection, and other ancillary merchandise, is sold at funeral service locations.
Our cemeteries provide cemetery property interment rights, including developed lots, lawn crypts, mausoleum spaces, niches, and other cremation memorialization and interment options. Cemetery merchandise and services, including memorial markers and bases, outer burial containers, flowers and floral placement, other ancillary merchandise, graveside services, merchandise installation, and interments, are sold at our cemeteries.

We also sell cemetery property interment rights and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services whereby a customer contractually agrees to the terms of certain products and services to be delivered and performed in the future. We define these sales as preneed sales. As a result of such preneed sales, our preneed backlog of unfulfilled funeral and cemetery contracts was $11.1 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The following table at December 31, 2018 provides the number of our funeral service locations and cemeteries by country, and by state, territory, or province:

We believe we have satisfactory title to the properties owned and used in our business, subject to various liens, encumbrances, and easements that are incidental to ownership rights and uses and do not materially detract from the value of the property. At December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 87% of the real estate and buildings used at our facilities, and the remainder of the facilities were leased under both capital and operating leases. At December 31, 2018, our 481 cemeteries contained a total of approximately 35,504 acres, of which approximately 66% was developed. 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 1929 Allen Parkway, Houston, Texas 77019. The property consists of approximately 160,000 square feet of office space and 185,000 square feet of parking space on approximately seven acres. We also lease approximately 35,000 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, which we utilize for corporate activities. We own a building in Jefferson, Louisiana with approximately 96,200 square feet of office space that we use, in part, for corporate activities.
A map of our locations in North America is presented below:
Competition
Although there are several public companies that own funeral service locations and cemeteries, the majority of deathcare businesses in North America are locally-owned, independent operations. We estimate that our funeral and cemetery market share in North America is approximately 15%-16% based on estimated total industry revenue. The position of a single funeral service location or cemetery in any community is a function of the name, reputation, and location of that funeral service location or cemetery, although competitive pricing, professional service and attention, and well-maintained locations are also important.
We believe we have an unparalleled network of funeral service locations and cemeteries that offer high quality products and services at prices that are competitive with local competing funeral service locations, cemeteries, and retail locations. Within this network, the funeral service locations and cemeteries operate under various names as most operations were acquired 
7

as existing businesses. We have co-branded the majority of our operations under the name Dignity Memorial®. We believe our branding strategy gives us a strategic advantage and identity in the industry. While this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries, the original names associated with acquired operations, and their inherent goodwill and heritage, generally remain the same. For example, Geo. H. Lewis & Sons Funeral Directors is now Geo. H. Lewis & Sons Funeral Directors, a Dignity Memorial® provider.
Strategies for Growth
We believe we are well positioned for long-term profitable growth. We are the largest consolidated deathcare company in North America and are poised to benefit from the aging of the American population. The demographic landscape is a factor driving our company strategy. The average age of our preneed cemetery consumer is late fifties to early sixties. The average age of our preneed funeral consumer is late sixties to early seventies. And the average age of our atneed consumer is late seventies to early eighties. We know that the Baby Boomers are already impacting our business today through the growth in our preneed cemetery sales programs. We anticipate seeing a similar impact on our preneed funeral results, and then ultimately on our atneed results. 
We have three core strategies designed to grow the company and enhance shareholder value: 1) grow revenue, 2) leverage our unparalleled scale, and 3) deploy capital. These strategies are centered on the consumer and our competitive advantages.
Grow Revenue
Our first core strategy is to grow revenue by remaining relevant to the customer and growing our preneed sales.
Remaining Relevant to the Customer. Remaining relevant to our customer is key to generating revenue growth in a changing customer environment. We are constantly evolving to meet the varying preferences and needs of our customers. In our funeral segment, we focus on memorialization services that will be meaningful to the customers, family members, and friends. We continue to offer contemporary product and service offerings. We also focus on the religious, ethnic, and cultural traditions important to our customers. Additionally, we continue to incorporate technology to aid in the visualization of our product and service offerings to ensure the selection process for the customer's experience is simple and transparent.
In our cemetery segment, we have created tiers within our cemetery product offerings to provide more choices for our customers. As with our funeral segment, we cater to the religious, ethnic, and cultural traditions important to our customers. We continue to develop innovative products such as recurring floral placements and customized cemetery property offerings. 
Growing Preneed Sales. Our preneed sales program drives current year and future revenue growth in both segments of our business. We believe we have a unique competitive advantage in growing preneed sales due to our size and scale. Within the funeral segment, our preneed funeral program creates greater brand awareness, secures future market share, and diversifies our revenue stream. We leverage our scale through a highly trained preneed sales force of approximately 4,300 counselors who provide customers informed guidance about various service and merchandise options designed to fit the needs of today’s consumer.
Within the cemetery segment, we offer a variety of property, merchandise, and service options designed to meet the needs of various religious, ethnic, and cultural preferences. Over the past three years, we have substantially increased our property options by implementing a tiering strategy that might offer as many as five unique choices for ground burial, mausoleum, or cremation memorialization. Our scale enables us to synchronize the construction of contemporary inventory with customer demand.
Leverage Our Unparalleled Scale
We leverage our unparalleled scale by developing our sales organization, using our scale to benefit our preneed backlog, as well as optimizing our network and deploying customer-facing technology. Our size and broad geographic network of businesses gives us a significant advantage in the industry.
Developing Our Sales Organization. Over the past several years, we have invested in the infrastructure and training of our sales organization. We continue to use and invest in technology to support our sales counselors. We have utilized a customer relationship management system (CRM) that has helped to increase sales production while managing costs. Our CRM system has enabled us to quickly respond to new leads, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales counselors. We believe that our scale allows us to operate, finance, and expand our sales organization in a manner that our competitors cannot afford to replicate.
Growing Our Preneed Backlog. With our $11.1 billion backlog, we benefit from having access to well recognized financial partners in the industry. For our trust investments, we have access to preeminent money managers and lower fee structures, which we believe are low risk structures that will provide us with higher returns and lower costs of administration over time. We also enjoy favorable terms with our third-party insurance provider. These arrangements with third-party partners and the favorable terms we receive on our trust investments cannot be duplicated by the independent operator, and give us a competitive advantage in asset growth leading to enhanced profitability over time.
Optimizing Our Network and Deploying Customer-Facing Technology. We continue to drive operating discipline and leverage our scale through standardizing processes and capitalizing on new technologies to improve the customer experience.

We regularly examine our purchasing spend to look for opportunities to consolidate our supplier base, modify processes and policies for more efficient purchasing, and employ metrics to manage and improve supplier performance. Our advancements in technology are changing the way we present our product and service offerings to customers. Our atneed point of sale system, HMIS+, uses a digital platform and photographs to create a seamless presentation of our products and services. Our newly implemented preneed sales system, Beacon, provides customers with the convenience of a mobile digital presentation. We also continue to refresh our websites to provide a better mobile experience and enhanced search engine capability. These customer-facing applications have resulted in favorable customer satisfaction ratings and increased package sales.
Deploy Capital
Our third core strategy is to maximize capital deployment opportunities to the highest and best use in a disciplined and balanced manner. Our strong liquidity and robust cash flow generation enables us to continue our long-standing commitment to use capital deployment to grow our business and enhance shareholder value. Our priorities for capital deployment are: 1) investing in acquisitions and building new funeral service locations, 2) paying dividends, 3) repurchasing shares, and 4) managing debt.
Investing in Acquisitions and Building New Funeral Service Locations. We plan to use our capital to manage our footprint by focusing on strategic acquisitions and building new funeral homes where the expected returns are attractive and exceed our weighted average cost of capital. We target businesses with favorable customer dynamics and/or where we can achieve additional economies of scale. Within our funeral segment, we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and to build new funeral service locations in areas that provide us with the potential for scale and in areas with the highest return customer categories and market traits. Within our cemetery segment, we plan to pursue strategic acquisitions to create more opportunities to sell to Baby Boomers through our customer-driven strategy. We believe our unparalleled business footprint and geographic diversity uniquely position us to benefit from the aging Baby Boomer population. We have a successful track record of integrating new businesses and achieving favorable returns on the capital deployed.
Paying Dividends. Our quarterly dividend rate has steadily grown from $0.025 per common share in 2005 to $0.17 per common share at the end of 2018. We target a payout ratio of 30% to 40% of earnings excluding special items and intend to grow our cash dividend commensurate with the growth in our business. While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, all future dividends are subject to limitations in our debt covenants and final determination by our Board of Directors each quarter upon review of our financial performance.
Repurchasing Shares. Absent opportunities for strategic acquisitions, we expect to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, debt covenants, and normal trading restrictions. The volume and timing of our purchases is determined as we evaluate the opportunity to capture value for our shareholders. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of shares outstanding by 25%. In February 2018, our Board of Directors increased our repurchase authorization for up to $400.0 million.The remaining dollar value of shares authorized to be purchased under the share repurchase program was $192.5 million at December 31, 2018. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we repurchased 193,395 shares for $7.9 million at an average cost per share of $40.70
Managing Debt. With a focus on maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility, we may seek to reduce our revolver borrowings or make open market debt repurchases when it is opportunistic to do so relative to other capital deployment opportunities to manage our near-term debt maturity profile.
Associates
At December 31, 2018, we employed 16,129 individuals on a full-time basis and 7,953 individuals on a part-time basis. Of the full-time associates, 13,827 were employed in the funeral and cemetery operations and 2,302 were employed in corporate or other overhead activities and services. All eligible associates in the United States who so elect are covered by our group health and life insurance plans. Associates covered by a collective bargaining agreement are typically covered by union health plans and are not eligible to participate in our health insurance plan. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 9,362 and 8,154 associates, respectively, who had elected to participate in our group health insurance plans. Eligible associates in the United States are covered by retirement plans of SCI or various subsidiaries, while international associates are covered by other SCI (or SCI subsidiary) defined contribution or government-mandated benefit plans. Approximately 2.5% of our associates are represented by unions. Although labor disputes occur from time to time, relations with associates are generally considered favorable.
Regulation
Our funeral operations are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) under the FTC’s Trade Regulation Rule on Funeral Industry Practices (the “Funeral Rule”), which went into effect in 1984. The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral merchandise and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: 1) misrepresenting legal, crematory, and cemetery requirements; 2) embalming for a fee without permission; 3) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; and 4) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral merchandise or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral merchandise or services. 
9

Our operations are also subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as Canadian and provincial laws and regulations. For example, state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral service locations and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities. Our facilities are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations. We take various measures to comply with the Funeral Rule and all laws and regulations. For example, we have established and maintain policies, procedures, and business practices; we engage in training of our personnel; and we carry out ongoing reviews of our compliance efforts. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Funeral Rule and all laws and regulations. 
Federal, state, and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies (including Canadian legislative bodies and agencies) frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the deathcare industry in general. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us.
