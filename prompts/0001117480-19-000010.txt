ITEM 1.      BUSINESS
Chimerix Overview
Chimerix, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing medicines that improve outcomes for immunocompromised patients. We were founded in 2000 based on the promise of our proprietary lipid conjugate technology to unlock the potential of some of the most broad-spectrum antivirals by enhancing their antiviral activity and safety profiles in convenient dosing regimens. Our lead compound, brincidofovir (BCV), is in development as an oral and intravenous (IV) formulation for the prevention and treatment of DNA viruses, including smallpox, adenovirus (AdV), and the human herpesviruses.

Brincidofovir
Brincidofovir is an investigational nucleoside analog that has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro against all five families of dsDNA (double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) viruses that cause human disease. In over 1,200 patients treated with BCV under a Chimerix protocol to-date, brincidofovir has been associated with a low risk of kidney or bone marrow toxicity. Oral and IV formulations of brincidofovir are currently in development, both of which deliver the active antiviral directly to the site of viral replication.
Potential indications for brincidofovir include prevention of serious viral infections in hematopoietic or stem cell transplant recipients (HCT), such as HHV-6, and treatment of serious AdV infection and disease, treatment of smallpox, and treatment of BK virus (BKV) infection in kidney and stem cell transplant recipients.
Composition of matter coverage for brincidofovir in the U.S. is currently expected to extend to October 2034. 
The Company has received three orphan designations from the European Commission in relation to brincidofovir, treatment of AdV infection in immunocompromised patients, prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and treatment of smallpox. Companies that obtain an orphan designation are eligible for a number of incentives in the European Union (EU), including free of charge scientific advice for each orphan designation received. Compounds still meeting the criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing approval may receive market exclusivity for 10 years from marketing approval, plus an additional two years of market exclusivity for medicines that have complied with the agreed pediatric investigational plan. The Company has also received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for brincidofovir treatment of smallpox.

I. | Oral Formulations of Brincidofovir

Brincidofovir remains in development as an orally-administered lipid conjugate nucleotide for the treatment of serious AdV infections and as a medical countermeasure for the treatment of smallpox.

A. | Oral Brincidofovir for Treatment of AdV

AdV causes gastrointestinal (GI) and upper respiratory infections, including the common cold, in individuals with a functional immune system. However, in people with a weakened immune system, AdV can lead to life-threatening infections, including pneumonia and hepatitis. Pediatric and adult patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT are at especially high risk for serious or fatal AdV infections due to profound immunodeficiency. Mortality rates of 50 to 80 percent have been reported in the literature for disseminated AdV disease. AdV infections are more common in pediatric transplant recipients than in adults; many transplant centers now actively screen their pediatric patients for AdV infection. There is currently no approved therapy for AdV infection, and although progression to disseminated disease occurs in a small proportion of patients, expected mortality for serious AdV disease is greater than 50 percent in the first three months after diagnosis.
Brincidofovir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that has demonstrated high in vitro potency against all AdV subtypes. Intracellular cleavage of brincidofovir allows cidofovir to be delivered directly to the site of viral replication. Moreover, there is a lower risk of nephrotoxicity and myelotoxicity associated with brincidofovir as compared to off-label use of intravenous cidofovir.
i.AdAPT 
We initiated the AdAPT study (Adenovirus after Allogeneic Pediatric Transplantation) in December 2017. This study is targeting enrollment of 141 pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients with confirmed AdV infection. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive short-course oral BCV or local standard-of-care (SOC) treatment at approximately 40 sites in Europe and the United States.
The primary endpoint of the study is a comparison of the average AdV viral burden (as measured by AdV DNA levels in blood) over 16 weeks in subjects treated with short-course oral BCV versus those who receive local SOC. The study is 90% powered to show the superiority of reduced adenoviral burden in brincidofovir-treated patients compared to SOC. The study is also designed to evaluate the correlation of adenoviral burden (and its clearance) with clinical outcomes, including survival. We have faced regulatory and site initiation delays in the implementation of this study. In addition, we have observed lower than anticipated incidence at the centers that have been initiated to date. Based on a thorough re-evaluation of current screening and enrollment rates, we now project that enrollment in AdAPT will be substantially delayed beyond 2019. While some recently initiated sites are historically more active in transplantation, we continue to evaluate strategies to accelerate the time to completion of the study, including opening further AdAPT sites, and possibly re-considering the targeted number of patients for full enrollment. The Company plans to provide an update on AdAPT enrollment in mid-2019.
4

If successful, AdAPT may form the basis of an application for conditional or full marketing approval of brincidofovir in the EU for the treatment of AdV infection in HCT recipients. A successful trial may also further support potential continued development of oral brincidofovir in the U.S.
AdVance is the largest multicenter observational study conducted to date for AdV infection after allogeneic HCT, with established outcomes associated with the current SOC for treatment of AdV in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. We believe these data will help support the virologic endpoint from our ongoing AdAPT clinical trial. In February 2019, we submitted a Type C meeting request with the FDA to review the AdVance data and virologic endpoints. 

B. | Oral Brincidofovir for Treatment of Smallpox

We are collaborating with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of BCV as a potential medical countermeasure for smallpox. Efficacy is to be demonstrated via two animal models under the FDA’s Animal Efficacy Rule. This rule allows for testing of investigational drugs in animal models to support the effectiveness of the drug in diseases in which human clinical studies are not ethical or feasible. In January 2019, we received positive preliminary top-line results of the in-life part of our adjunct pivotal rabbitpox efficacy study that was conducted under the Animal Efficacy Rule. The study was designed to determine the effect of administering BCV to animals at certain times (3, 4, 5 or 6 days) after inoculation with the rabbitpox virus. These preliminary results are subject to further audit, however, based on these preliminary findings the study met its primary endpoint. The topline survival results are as follows:

 | BCV treatment 3 days post-infection | BCV treatment 4 days post-infection | BCV treatment 5 days post-infection | BCV treatment 6 days post-infection | No treatment (placebo)
Overall Survival | 29/29 (100%) | 26/29 (90%) | 20/29 (69%) | 20/29 (69%) | 8/28 (29%) 
P-value vs. Group 5 | <0.0001 | <0.0001 | 0.0014 | 0.0014 | 0 

The differences in survival rate observed between each group of animals that received BCV and the animals that did not are statistically significant. Data from this study are in-line with those reported in 2015 from our first pivotal study in the rabbitpox model. 
In February 2019, we initiated a pivotal study in the mouse ectromelia model, which constitutes our second animal model as described in the Animal Efficacy Rule. We anticipate data from this study in the second half of 2019 and, contingent upon the results of the animal efficacy studies, we plan to submit marketing applications in 2020.  

C. | Oral Brincidofovir Expanded Access Program

We continue to fulfill requests for orally administered brincidofovir via our expanded access programs. In 2018, we granted almost 340 requests for brincidofovir for the treatment of AdV, highlighting the continued unmet need in this area.

II. | IV Formulation of Brincidofovir

Our ability to provide brincidofovir in oral and IV formulations enables development across multiple indications and populations with the potential for best-in-class efficacy and safety. In animal studies and multiple dose administration in healthy subjects, IV BCV has shown the potential for less GI injury compared to oral brincidofovir, even with higher plasma drug concentrations and longer-term dosing. 

A. | IV Brincidofovir Multiple Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects

In late 2017, we completed the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of IV BCV in healthy subjects. This Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IV BCV 10 mg given twice weekly and IV BCV 20 mg given once weekly in healthy subjects for two to four weeks. IV BCV was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no dose-limiting clinical adverse events. Importantly, there was no diarrhea reported for IV BCV 10 mg dosed twice weekly, a dose that provides drug levels equivalent to oral BCV 100 mg which demonstrated antiviral activity in previous late-stage clinical studies. Non-clinically-relevant elevations in serum transaminases were noted as seen in previous studies of oral BCV. 
5


B. | Ongoing Phase 2 Studies (210/211)

Following completion of the MAD study of IV brincidofovir in healthy subjects, we have started two Phase 2 open label dose-ranging studies of IV BCV in patients with active AdV.
Studies of IV BCV in AdV virally-infected patients are ongoing. These studies may provide data on other viral infections such as CMV and/or BKV in patients with multi-viral infections. These studies are the first-in-patient studies to demonstrate the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of IV BCV in adult HCT recipients. We will also evaluate the relationship between dose and change from baseline in AdV in blood and stool. Similar to AdAPT, we have faced regulatory and site initiation delays in the implementation of these studies. We have also observed lower than anticipated incidence at the study 210/211 centers that have been initiated, which has caused enrollment to occur more slowly than expected. We plan to provide a study update in mid-2019.
Data from these studies will inform the dose and dosing regimen for our potential Multi Viral Protection (MVP)-Peds study and potential studies of IV BCV for other DNA viruses, such as BKV or HHV-6. 
The improved drug concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) achieved with IV brincidofovir in animals could support the study of IV brincidofovir in viral CNS infections such as herpes encephalitis, HHV-6 encephalitis, JC virus infection.
CMX521 for Norovirus
CMX521 is a nucleoside analog identified from our proprietary Chemical Library which targets the norovirus polymerase, a part of the virus that is common to all strains and is required for viral replication. It therefore has the potential to be active against the multiple genetically diverse norovirus strains that circulate each year and cause disease in humans. 
We previously presented the safety and tolerability data from a Phase 1 study of CMX521, which supported continued development of the first small molecule in clinical development for prophylaxis or treatment of norovirus. Evaluation of active antiviral concentrations in GI biopsies indicate that improved intracellular delivery is needed prior to conducting efficacy studies. The norovirus research and development program has been paused indefinitely.
CMX157 
CMX157, our second clinical stage nucleoside analog, uses the same proprietary lipid technology as brincidofovir to deliver high intracellular concentrations of the potent antiviral drug, tenofovir. Tenofovir, marketed under the brand name Viread® and in multiple fixed-dose combinations, is widely used for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In December 2014, we entered into a licensing agreement with ContraVir Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: CTRV) for the development and commercialization of CMX157 for certain antiviral indications. Under the terms of the agreement, ContraVir has sole responsibility with respect to the control of the development and commercialization of CMX157.
Lipid Conjugate Technology and Our Chemical Library
Lipid Conjugate Technology
Our proprietary lipid conjugate technology is used to covalently modify a drug molecule with a lipid side-chain that mimics a naturally occurring phospholipid component of cellular membranes. The lipid mimic can then utilize natural uptake pathways to achieve oral bioavailability, enhance uptake into cells, and potentially to avoid many toxicities.
We believe that our lipid conjugate technology can be used to develop new drugs from parent molecules having a known mechanism of action but potentially with an improved safety, efficacy, and/or ADME (absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion) profile relative to the parent. Preclinical studies and in vitro assessments of a number of drugs, including some that are approved, have shown specific improvements in biological activity compared with the parent drug.
The most advanced example of our proprietary lipid conjugate technology is brincidofovir, which was developed to improve the efficacy and safety of an approved drug, cidofovir. Use of cidofovir has been limited by significant toxicities, particularly kidney toxicity. Unlike cidofovir, the lipid-conjugated brincidofovir molecule is not actively concentrated in the kidneys, but does effectively deliver the active antiviral to cells. Brincidofovir may have a higher benefit-risk ratio that allows expanded use relative to cidofovir, for example in prevention of AdV disease, and potentially protection from or treatment of other DNA viruses.

Chimerix Chemical Library
The Chimerix Chemical Library contains over 10,000 heterocyclic ring systems and nucleosides, the majority of which were originally synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Leroy Townsend at the University of Michigan. This library includes approximately 3,500 nucleoside analog compounds, most of which are candidates for lipid conjugation. We have an active discovery program focusing on viral diseases in which there is significant unmet medical need. We periodically screen the library for activity against viral targets for which limited or no therapies are currently available.
Evaluation of External Opportunities to Strengthen our Pipeline 
We are looking at business development opportunities as a means to complement our existing pipeline with technologies that will take advantage of our strengths. We are actively seeking opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of, or investment in, other companies, through strategic relationships, or through in-licensing of complementary compounds and products.
Significant Agreements
ContraVir Pharmaceuticals
In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with ContraVir Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: CTRV) for the development and commercialization of CMX157 for certain antiviral indications. Under the terms of the agreement, ContraVir has sole responsibility with respect to the control of the development and commercialization of CMX157.
In exchange for the license to CMX157 rights, we received an upfront payment consisting of 120,000 shares of ContraVir Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1.2 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to approximately $20 million in clinical, regulatory and initial commercial milestones in the United States and Europe, as well as royalties and additional milestones based on commercial sales in those territories. Either party may terminate the license agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party (subject to standard cure periods), or upon certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. ContraVir may also terminate the license agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis upon sixty days’ prior written notice.
In September 2016, we converted our shares of ContraVir Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of ContraVir common stock.
BARDA
In February 2011, we entered into a contract with BARDA for the advanced development of brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. BARDA is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response that supports the advanced research and development, manufacturing, acquisition and stockpiling of medical countermeasures. The scope of work for the contract includes preclinical, clinical and manufacturing development activities that fall into the following areas: non-clinical animal efficacy studies; clinical activities; manufacturing activities; and all associated regulatory, quality assurance, management, and administrative activities.
Under the contract, BARDA will reimburse our costs, plus pay us a fixed fee, for the research and development of brincidofovir as a treatment of smallpox infections. The contract consists of an initial performance period, referred to as the base performance segment which ended on May 31, 2013, plus up to four extension periods, referred to as option segments, each of which may be exercised at BARDA’s sole discretion. We must complete agreed upon milestones and deliverables in each discrete work segment before the next option segment is eligible to be exercised. Under the contract as currently in effect, if each follow-on option segment is exercised by BARDA, we may receive up to $75.8 million in expense reimbursement and $5.3 million in fees.
We substantially completed the first option segment of the contract on August 28, 2014. In September 2014, we were awarded a contract extension for a second option segment providing an additional $17.0 million. In August 2016, the contract was amended to provide an additional $535,000, in December 2017 the contract was amended to increase funding by an additional $4.1 million, and in January 2019 the contract was amended to increase funding by an additional $2.3 million for the performance of the second option segment, which is scheduled to end on August 1, 2019. On September 11, 2015, BARDA exercised option segment three, which provided approximately $12.9 million in funding for the performance of the segment. In December 2017, BARDA decreased the scope of this segment by removing a potential second pivotal ectromelia virus study which decreased the funding of this option segment by $1.3 million to a total award of $11.6 million; option segment three is scheduled to end on March 30, 2019. Of the $75.8 million expense reimbursement and $5.3 million in fees that we may receive, approximately $74.3 million in expense 
7

reimbursement and fees has been funded. As of December 31, 2018, of the total funding we had invoiced an aggregate of $62.6 million with respect to the base performance segment and the first three extension periods.
Pursuant to the contract, Chimerix and the U.S. government share the rights to any inventions made in the performance of our work under the contract. Specifically, the U.S. government retains a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid up license to any invention made in the performance of our work under the contract, provided, however, that the U.S. government may, under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving public health and safety, license such inventions to third parties without our consent. There have been no inventions made to date under the BARDA contract.
The contract may be terminated by BARDA ten days after giving us notice of a material default which remains uncured for ten days. In addition, BARDA is also permitted under applicable law to terminate the contract if it is in the U.S. government’s best interest.
In April 2015, the DHHS, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, BARDA posted a notice of intent to use other than full and open competition (Notice of Intent) to award a sole source contract to us for the procurement of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox. 
In July 2015, BARDA issued a RFP entitled “2015 Procurement of a Second Smallpox Antiviral Drug for the Strategic National Stockpile.” In August 2015, we submitted a response to the RFP and we subsequently engaged in discussions with BARDA regarding our response. The issuance of that RFP did not culminate with agreement for the sole source supply of brincidofovir for the Strategic National Stockpile. 
There are no RFPs for procurement of a smallpox antiviral pertaining to brincidofovir that are currently pending.
In the event a new RFP is issued we will likely submit a proposal. In the event that our proposal is chosen (potentially among several competing proposals) and before we can enter into a contract we must negotiate its terms, including the price and delivery schedule. In addition, as a governmental agency, BARDA’s ability to enter into a contract is subject to continued funding for this purpose, which can change at any time. We remain in discussions with BARDA regarding the potential to supply brincidofovir to the Strategic National Stockpile, however, there can be no assurances regarding any such procurement. The Company continues to receive funding under an advanced research and development contract for the development of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox. We are currently evaluating brincidofovir for efficacy in two different animal models to support potential approval under the FDA’s Animal Efficacy Rule.
The Regents of the University of California
In May 2002, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California (UC) under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to UC’s patent rights in certain inventions (the UC Patent Rights) related to lipid-conjugated antiviral compounds and their use, including certain patents relating to brincidofovir and CMX157. Under the license agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the UC Patent Rights for all human and veterinary uses, and to sublicense such rights subject to certain sublicensing fees and royalty payments.
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we issued UC an aggregate of 64,788 shares of our common stock. In connection to the development and commercialization of brincidofovir and CMX157, we could be required to pay UC up to an aggregate of $3.4 million in milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all applicable milestone events under the license agreement. In addition, upon commercialization of any product utilizing the UC Patent Rights, which would include brincidofovir or CMX157, we will be required to pay low single digit royalties on net sales of such product.
The license agreement requires that we diligently develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds that are covered by the UC Patent Rights, and we have agreed to meet certain development and commercialization milestones. UC may, at its option, either terminate the license agreement or change the license granted from an exclusive license to a non-exclusive license if we fail to meet such development and commercialization milestones. We are currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. 
University of Michigan
In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of Michigan (UM) under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to UM’s patent rights in certain inventions (UM Patent Rights) related to certain compounds originally synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Leroy Townsend at the University of Michigan. Under the license agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the UM Patent Rights, and to sublicense such rights subject to certain sublicensing fees and royalty payments.
8

In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we have paid UM an aggregate of $70,000 in fees and in January 2017 issued UM an aggregate of 33,058 shares of our common stock. In connection with our commercialization or sublicensing of certain products covered by the license agreement, including CMX521, we could be required to pay royalties on net sales of such products ranging from 0.25% to 2%. Beginning in 2024, we are also subject to certain minimum annual royalty payments.
The UM license agreement requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make commercially available licensed products as soon as practicable. Specifically, we have agreed to make the first commercial sale of a licensed product by June of 2026. UM may terminate the license agreement if we materially breach the license agreement. We are currently in compliance with our milestone requirements.
Commercial Operations
We anticipate that our first commercial indication for brincidofovir may be in the treatment of AdV infections in pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients. In anticipation of potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of brincidofovir, we are building select commercial functions tied to key milestones. These milestones include the availability of data from our IV brincidofovir studies, and other potential trials or studies, potential submission of marketing applications for brincidofovir, and anticipated approval (or PDUFA) dates.
Patients who undergo an allogeneic HCT are likely to be treated at a small number of major medical centers by specialized teams of physicians and healthcare providers. There are approximately 200 HCT transplant centers in the U.S. and 300 in the EU-5. The management of therapies for transplant patients is largely the responsibility of transplant physicians, infectious disease specialists, and clinical pharmacists who oversee post-transplant therapies. These clinicians focus on prevention and management of post-transplant infections as one of their key priorities. Practice patterns for the management of transplant patients and post-transplant viral infections vary from institution to institution and are highly driven by research activities, data and publications.
If brincidofovir is approved for the treatment of AdV infection, we believe it is possible for us to commercialize brincidofovir in the United States. We anticipate that this would entail a relatively small commercial infrastructure, which may include a contract sales force, partner sales force, or internal team. While our commercialization efforts may initially be focused on health care providers who are responsible for treating AdV, this commercial infrastructure would serve as the foundation for an expanded commercial presence based on lifecycle indications and other opportunities within the corporate portfolio.
Outside of the United States, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we may seek to commercialize brincidofovir ourselves or through distribution or other collaboration arrangements. If we elect to develop brincidofovir for other DNA viral indications, we would plan to do so selectively either on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs, reimbursement complexities and our available resources.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our therapeutic experience, scientific and commercial knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we will face competition from large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and other emerging technologies.
We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of brincidofovir and our other product candidates are the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile and the risk:benefit trade-off compared to alternative therapies or procedures. Securing market access and reimbursement will be an important element of product uptake and market penetration. Our commercial opportunity could be negatively impacted if our competitors develop or market products or other technologies that are more effective, better tolerated, safer, more convenient or have greater market access than brincidofovir, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. In addition, our ability to compete will be affected by the availability of generic products.
9

If approved, brincidofovir would compete with a number of existing products and other product candidates that target serious viral infections, including drugs and vaccines which demonstrate efficacy against viruses that affect our target patient populations. We believe brincidofovir has potential benefits over the competitive products, including the potential to be the first antiviral indicated for treatment of disseminated AdV in allogeneic HCT recipients. Based on market research, competing products that are currently used, or being developed for use, to treat AdV include and are not limited to:

• | cidofovir, a drug that is sold by generic manufacturers; and


• | patient-specific T-cell therapies.

Other product candidates currently in development may compete against brincidofovir for the prevention or mitigation of CMV infection in a variety of settings, including:

• | letermovir (marketed under the trade name PREVYMIS), an anti-CMV drug recently approved for the prevention of CMV infections in adult HCT recipients pursuant to an exclusive worldwide license agreement between AiCuris GmbH & Co. KG and Merck & Co., Inc.;


• | maribavir, an antiviral owned by Shire plc, currently in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of CMV resistant or refractory CMV infections in both HCT and SOT adult patients, and for preemptive use in adult HCT patients; and


• | patient-specific T-cell therapies directed at antigens of CMV and other dsDNA viruses.

Furthermore, we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market, as advanced technologies become available and as increasing numbers of generic formulations of currently branded products become available.
Changes in the health care system may limit our ability to price brincidofovir or our other product candidates at a level that would allow recovery of our research and development costs and may impede our ability to generate or maintain a profit.
We believe that brincidofovir has potential benefits over existing and potential competitive products as described in more detail under “Business - Brincidofovir.” As a result, we believe that brincidofovir should be well positioned to gain market share if we obtain the required regulatory approval. However, even with those benefits, we may not be able to make promotional claims that brincidofovir is superior to these competing products without conducting additional studies, which delivers differentiated data, and brincidofovir may be unable to compete successfully against these products. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates.”
Our Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies we believe are important to our business, including by seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain licenses to our intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of our lipid conjugate technology platform and the Chimerix Chemical Library.
At February 15, 2019, our worldwide patent portfolio included:

• | 123 patents or patent applications that we own or have in-licensed from academic institutions, related to brincidofovir and CMX157, which represented a slight decrease over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal 2017;


• | This includes 87 US and foreign exclusively and jointly owned patents and 36 US and foreign applications related to brincidofovir and CMX157. Granted European patents are counted as one patent and have been validated throughout Europe; 


• | 19 jointly-owned patents or patent applications related to our agreement with the UM regarding our proprietary Chemical Library; and


• | One international patent application owned exclusively by Chimerix directed to a morphic form of a compound from the Chemical Library.

10

In 2015, U.S. Patent No. 8,962,829 covering a method of synthesis and the commercial morphic form of brincidofovir was issued to Chimerix. With the addition of this patent, composition of matter coverage for brincidofovir in the U.S. is expected to extend to October 2034.
Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our lipid-antiviral-conjugate technology platform and the Chimerix Chemical Library, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our antivirals, upon appropriate regulatory approvals, in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to the conduct of our business as a whole.
We are also open to expanding our intellectual property portfolio through licensing intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have granted and will continue to grant to others licenses under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate and we do not expect to own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. In the past, we have relied on third-party manufacturers for supply of our lead product candidate, brincidofovir, as well as our other product candidates. We expect that in the future we will rely on such manufacturers for supply of drug substance and drug product that will be used in clinical trials of brincidofovir, as well as for commercial purposes should brincidofovir be approved. When produced on a commercial scale, we expect that cost-of-goods-sold relating to brincidofovir will generally be in-line with that of other small-molecule pharmaceutical compounds.
The manufacturing process for brincidofovir drug substance is relatively straight-forward and generally in-line with other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds in terms of cost and complexity. The process is robust and reproducible, does not require dedicated reactors or specialized equipment, uses common synthetic chemistry and readily available materials, including off-the-shelf and made-to-order starting materials, and is readily transferable.
Our current drug substance supply chain for brincidofovir involves various contractors that supply the raw materials for the drug substance process, a contract manufacturer for an intermediate, and a contract manufacturer for the drug substance. We have completed transferring our current commercial drug substance manufacturing process to our selected contractor that will produce the commercial supply of drug substance and began process validation during 2015. Manufacturers of drug components must meet certain FDA qualifications with respect to manufacturing standards. At present, we have qualified only one firm as a supplier of drug substance. We continually assess our manufacturing needs and may seek to engage additional qualified vendors as circumstances dictate. Changes in our requirements may require revalidation of the manufacturing process at a different scale and potentially at a different contractor depending on the necessary scale, infrastructure and technical capabilities. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate.
Our drug products (tablets, oral suspension, intravenous solution or lyophilized powder for solution) are also manufactured under contract. We have completed development and transfer of our current commercial suspension and tablet manufacturing process to our selected contractor that will produce commercial supplies. We initiated validation of these processes in 2018. The intravenous formulation of brincidofovir is in early-stage development.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
Pursuant to our license agreement with ContraVir, the manufacture of CMX157 is under the control and direction of ContraVir.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and government authorities of member states of the EU and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality 
11

control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA or EMA before it may be legally marketed in the United States or EU and in other countries by the responsible national regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, FDA approval process or after FDA approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action, whether before or after the FDA approval process, could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (GLP), or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practices (GCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a NDA for a new drug;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and FDA review of the NDA.

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or affected patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Patients not meeting protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria may be considered for our expanded access program under the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB), at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
12

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 


• | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to determine if they are substantially complete before it accepts them for filing; this initial review period prior to accepting the NDA for filing is 2 months in duration. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months from the date of accepting the NDA for filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission without prior agreement reached at a pre-submission meeting.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically 
13

a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements. If major issues with trial conduct are identified at a site, data collected from that site can be determined to be unacceptable for supporting the application. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a number of programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products for serious conditions that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and/or Priority Review designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition 
14

and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Breakthrough Therapy designation is for a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. Unique to Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy products, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy programs, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-review of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track, Breakthrough, and Priority Review designations and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Animal Efficacy Rule
FDA permits the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from clinical trial(s) in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, which are known as the “Animal Rule”, authorize the FDA to rely on animal studies to provide evidence of a product’s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the activity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with the FDA’s prior agreement, drugs used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated under this rule must demonstrate effectiveness through pivotal animal studies, which are generally equivalent in design and robustness to Phase 3 clinical studies. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. Safety under this rule is established under preexisting requirements, including safety studies in both animals (toxicology) and humans. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.
Expanded access programs
Many jurisdictions allow the supply of unauthorized medicinal products in the context of strictly regulated and exceptional early access programs, and some countries may provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of such programs. The promotion, advertising and marketing of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited, and authorization for early access programs must generally be obtained from regulatory authorities, which might not grant such authorization. To provide expanded access, sponsors must submit detailed regulatory information to the FDA. FDA authorization depends on several different factors, including whether expanded access will interfere with related clinical trials or drug development. In addition to the FDA’s early access program, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. Sponsors may not promote products as safe or effective for expanded-access uses. 
15

Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products for which we or our strategic alliance partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising agreements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Our strategic alliance partners may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such strategic alliance partner. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year 
16

exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
US Health Care Laws
Our operations may be subject to federal and state health care laws and regulations including, without limitation: anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, patient data privacy and security laws, and physician payment transparency laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including prescription drugs. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved prescription drugs and other healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow the sale of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved on a competitive and profitable basis.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities to provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each Part D prescription drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all of the drugs within each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
It is not clear what long-term effect the MMA will have on the prices paid for currently approved drugs and the pricing options for newly approved drugs. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, although the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Accordingly, any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Currently, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs. However, the U.S. Congress may in the future consider legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research would be developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures would be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear whether research would have any effect on the sales of any of our products that are successfully developed and approved, if the product or the 
17

condition that it is intended to treat becomes the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Among other things, the ACA expands and increases industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies because some of the ACA’s reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations to implement the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred. In addition, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect such challenges to continue. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. Legislation enacted in 2017 (H.R. 1, "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018"), informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the ACA, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, and also increases in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent to 70 percent. In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace ACA will impact ACA.
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act), which was enacted as part of ACA, requires covered manufacturers of drugs covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of the DHHS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals, during the course of the preceding calendar year. The final rule implementing the Sunshine Act, published on February 8, 2013, requires data collection on payments to begin on August 1, 2013. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission.
If not preempted by the ACA, several states require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, some states, such as California, Nevada and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, including several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. 
In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict

the range of medicinal products for which their respective national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products for which we receive marketing approval. Historically, the price structures for products launched in the EU do not follow those of the United States and tend to be significantly lower.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our strategic alliance partners will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA), must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the particular clinical trial may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or a Biologics License Application in the United States is similar to the application dossier (eCTD) required in the EU.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
EU Review and Approval Process

In the EU, there are two main routes for authorizing the marketing of medicines, a centralized route and a national route. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicines, including those that have received orphan designation from the European Commission (Orphan Designation). 
Under the centralized authorization procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing-authorization application to the EMA. EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) carries out a scientific assessment of the application and makes a recommendation to the European Commission whether the medicine should be marketed or not. If authorization is granted by the European Commission, the centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
Additionally, medicines that belong to at least one of the below categories may be granted a conditional market authorization (CMA). This regulatory pathway is intended to help speed up patient access to new medicines that are:

• | aimed at treating, preventing or diagnosing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases;


• | intended for use in emergency situations (also less comprehensive pharmaceutical and non-clinical data may be accepted for such products); and/or


• | designated as orphan medicines.

A CMA may be granted if: (1) the CHMP finds that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data, (3) the unmet medical needs will be fulfilled, and (4) the benefit to public

health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data.
CMAs are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The CMA holder will be required to complete specific obligations (to complete ongoing or new studies, and in some cases additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the CMA may be converted into a full marketing authorization (not subject to specific obligations). Initially, this is valid for five years, but can be renewed for unlimited validity.
Orphan Designation in the EU
In order to qualify for Orphan Designation, a medicine must meet the following criteria:

• | it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;


• | the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and


• | no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.

EMA is responsible for reviewing applications from sponsors for orphan designation. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), through its network of experts, examines applications for Orphan Designation and issues an opinion to EMA. The evaluation process takes approximately of 90 days from validation. Once EMA receives COMP’s opinion, EMA sends it to the European Commission, which is responsible for granting the Orphan Designation. 
At the time a sponsor of a marketing application files for marketing authorization for a medicine that has received Orphan Designation, the sponsor must also submit a report on the maintenance of the Orphan Designation in parallel. EMA uses this report to determine whether the medicine can maintain its status as an orphan medicine and benefit from the extended market exclusivity applicable to orphan products. Market exclusivity is linked to the maintenance of the Orphan Designation when the medicine receives a marketing authorization for the indication concerned.
If it is determined that a medicine still meets the criteria for Orphan Designation at the time of marketing approval, that medicine may benefit from a period of ten years market exclusivity in the EU. This incentive is intended to protect orphan medicines from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved, and fundamentally to encourage the development of medicines for rare diseases.
The applicant is obliged to submit an annual report to the EMA every year after their medicine has been granted orphan designation. The annual report needs provide information on the status of the development of the medicine, such as a review of ongoing clinical studies, a description of the investigation plan for the coming year and any anticipated or current problems in the process, difficulties in testing and potential changes that may have an impact on the medicine’s orphan designation. 
The European Commission is responsible for granting market exclusivity for orphan medicines. Market exclusivity is linked to each specific Orphan Designation for which a marketing authorization has been granted. 
The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that also have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP). Each orphan designation for a product linked to a separate orphan condition is eligible for a two-year extension if this is accounted for in the PIP. The extension is granted by the European Commission based on the positive compliance check from the Pediatric Committee and opinion from the CHMP.
