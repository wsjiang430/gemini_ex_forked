General 
 
Purpose built for the cloud, Cyren is an early pioneer and leading innovator of SaaS security solutions that protect businesses, their employees and customers from threats on the web, in email and on mobile devices. Our mission is to protect people and organizations from cyber threats when they use the internet.
 
Cyren’s cloud-first approach to security sets us apart from other vendors in the market. Cyren is an internet security company that is delivering security results that are disrupting legacy vendors and appliance-based solutions. Our security solutions are architected around the fundamental belief that internet security is a race against time – and the cloud best enables the speed, sophistication and advanced automation needed to detect and block threats as they emerge on the internet. As more and more businesses move their data and applications to the cloud, they need a security provider that is able to keep pace.
 
Today’s internet threats are faster and stealthier than ever. As cybercrime has become more sophisticated, every malware, phishing and ransomware variant is unique, making it more difficult to detect and block attacks. While organizations have traditionally protected their users with gateway security appliances at their network perimeter, more frequent and evasive attacks combined with a more distributed workforce are reducing the effectiveness of this approach. Traditional appliances lack the real-time threat intelligence and processing power to detect emerging threats, and the growth of mobile devices and an increasingly distributed workforce mean that more and more business is conducted outside of the traditional network perimeter. As a result, when new attacks appear in a matter of seconds, legacy appliances can leave companies vulnerable for hours, days or even weeks.
 
Cyren’s security cloud delivers faster detection and protection, with SaaS security solutions that inspect web and email traffic before it reaches a user’s browser or inbox – often identifying and blocking threats in just seconds. Our SaaS solutions are easy to deploy and manage, delivering critical security and faster innovation, for a low total cost of ownership. In May 2018, Cyren launched its most recent version Cyren Cloud Security (CCS 4.5) which added GDPR features to its single globally operated security as a service platform which consisted of Cyren Web Security (CWS), Cyren Email Security (CES), Cyren DNS security and Cloud Sandboxing. In April 2018, Cyren also announced that its Threat Intelligence Services and GlobalView™, security intelligence cloud would be integrated into the Microsoft Office 365 network in order to help combat malicious email, and complement Microsoft’s real-time detection of the latest email threats and potentially harmful URLs. In September 2018, Cyren launched its GoCloud Partner Program, a new global channel program that provides resellers, managed service providers, and distributors with the opportunity to partner with Cyren and add Cyren’s cloud security solutions to their portfolios.
 
Our Offerings
 
Cyren’s cloud security services are delivered via two security platforms:
 

● | Cyren Cloud Security (CCS) – this SaaS security platform is designed for enterprise customers, and is sold either directly or through channel partners. Cyren Cloud Security (CCS) services currently include Web Security (CWS), Email Security (CES), DNS Security, and Cloud Sandboxing. Cyren expects to release two additional enterprise products on the CCS platform in 2019, which are further detailed below.

These platforms are powered by Cyren GlobalView, Cyren’s global security cloud (see Figure 1 below) that identifies emerging threats in real time. GlobalView analyzes over 25 billion security transactions each day, using big data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced heuristics to rapidly detect and prevent sophisticated attacks. By inspecting internet traffic in the cloud, Cyren identifies and automatically blocks threats as they emerge on the internet, stopping threats in seconds before they reach users. Google, Microsoft and Check Point are just a few of the organizations that depend on Cyren to power their security infrastructure.
 

Figure 1: The Cyren GlobalView security cloud applies advanced detection engines against massive volumes of security transactions in real time to identify emerging cyber threats in seconds.
 
Cyren GlobalView
 
With massive volumes of enterprise and consumer traffic from more than 180 countries, GlobalView is able to see and analyze emerging threats on the internet within seconds. The key to GlobalView’s detections capabilities include:
 

(i) | Massive Security Data – Everyday, Cyren processes more than 25 billion security transactions generated by over 1.3 billion users worldwide to detect cyber threats as they emerge – including thousands of new, never-been-seen malicious IP addresses, phishing sites and URLs. As a result, Cyren is able to identify new and emerging threats in seconds.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Comprehensive Detection Technologies – Cyren’s proprietary detection engines leverage big data analytics, advanced heuristics, patented Recurrent Pattern Detection (RPD), behavioral sandboxing, and machine learning, all tied together in a single-pass streaming architecture that applies these detection techniques in parallel. Distributed, massively scalable, and fault tolerant, this approach delivers fully automated real-time threat identification with zero human intervention across web, DNS, email, and files.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Advanced Cyber Intelligence – Real-time, actionable cyber intelligence services are used by over 100 technology and security providers including Google, Microsoft and Check Point. The breadth and accuracy of our security cloud identifies and blocks more than 300 million threats each day, and enables protection from malicious messages, hosts and websites, and instantly automates protection for all users.

Figure 2: Cyren Cloud Security is a 100% cloud-delivered SaaS security platform.
    Cyren Cloud Security:
 
Cyren Cloud Security (CCS) offers enterprise customers a broad set of internet security services from a common integrated platform (see Figure 2 above), referred to by some in the industry as a “secure internet gateway”. The services include Cyren Web Security (a SaaS secure web gateway), Cyren Email Security (a SaaS secure email gateway), Cyren DNS Security (a SaaS DNS web filtering solution), and Cyren Cloud Sandboxing (an advanced threat protection service integrated into Cyren Web Security and Cyren Email Security, and also available as a standalone service). These products are all available on the CCS platform, leveraging shared threat detection services, a common policy framework, integrated reporting, customer onboarding and license management. Each of these service offerings may be purchased separately, or as part of a bundled suite. All products are sold on a per-user SaaS subscription model, providing customers with a quick-to-deploy, easy-to-manage solution and a low total cost of ownership.
 
Cyren has also announced its intention to release two new enterprise-focused product offerings on the CCS platform in 2019:
 
Cyren Web Security (CWS) – provides enforcement of web policy and state-of-the-art threat protection for business users, with intrinsic SaaS simplicity: quick to deploy, easy to manage, comprehensive in coverage, and requiring just a subscription to start. Cyren Web Security offers multilayered proxy-based defense-in-depth, protecting organizations from a broad range of threats including ransomware, malicious URLs, phishing attacks, viruses, zero-day malware, botnets, and much more.

Cyren Email Security (CES) – a comprehensive cloud-based secure email gateway that works well with both on premise and cloud-based business email, Cyren Email Security filters an organization’s inbound and outbound email to protect users from cyber threats and spam, and offers email archiving for easier eDiscovery and regulatory compliance. Inbound email security protects against malware, phishing, business email compromise, and more, with advanced threat protection from cloud sandboxing, malware outbreak protection and time-of-click analysis. Support for SPF (Sender Policy Framework) provides sender validation to prevent email spoofing, while policy-based encryption protects sensitive email communications. Outbound protections block botnet-infected devices from sending malware or spam from a customer’s domain.
 
Cyren DNS Security – keeps users safe from web-borne threats and blocks inappropriate content with a cloud service which is easy to deploy and simple to manage. Cyren DNS Security allows businesses to quickly and easily protect employees at headquarters, visitors in remote offices, customers at retail stores, or students on a campus. Featuring a simple policy-based set-up, businesses can block malicious phishing and botnet sites, stop people from accessing specific types of websites, enforce “safe search,” and ensure a positive web experience for users.
 
Cyren Sandboxing – an advanced layer of security that augments Cyren’s web and email security services, Cyren Sandboxing protects businesses against breaches and data loss from today’s most sophisticated and evasive threats. Cyren Sandboxing “detonates” suspicious files and URLs to determine if they are malicious, even threats that have never been seen before, including zero-day exploits, targeted attacks, and advanced persistent threats. Because these kinds of threats are increasingly “sandbox aware” as hackers use diverse strategies to evade detection by traditional sandboxing appliances, Cyren’s unique cloud sandbox array technology (see Figure 3 below) automatically detonates these malicious files and embedded URLs across multiple different sandboxes until they express their full set of behaviors.
 

Figure 3: Cyren’s patent-pending cloud sandbox array technology continues to detonate suspicious files until their full malicious behavior has been expressed.
 
Cyren Inbox Security (CIS) – This new enterprise anti-phishing service leverages the technology Cyren developed for Microsoft Office 365. Expected to be available during mid-2019, we anticipate it will offer a huge leap forward for enterprises who are struggling to deal with the ongoing problem of phishing attacks. Unlike existing email security solutions on the market, we expect Cyren Inbox Security will be able to proactively remediate and remove phishing emails after they have been delivered to a user’s mailbox, regardless of who the company is using as an email gateway for their primary level of protection.

Cyren Web Security for Windows Defender ATP – In January 2019, Cyren announced a partnership with Microsoft to integrate Cyren’s web security technology directly into the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) platform. Microsoft currently bundles its Windows Defender endpoint security solution within Windows 10, as a free alternative to other antimalware solutions. However, the Windows Defender ATP platform is a premium paid service that is targeted at large enterprise customers, and Microsoft is developing an ecosystem of security vendors to deliver enhanced security solutions. Cyren was selected as Microsoft’s premiere partner to add web security technology into the Windows Defender ATP platform, and is working jointly with Microsoft to integrate Cyren’s web security technology directly into Windows Defender ATP. The new integrated offering will initially be made available as a private preview with a select set of enterprise customers during the first half of 2019, with the goal of reaching general availability for all Windows Defender ATP customers later in the year. This solution will complement Cyren’s existing web security offerings which include either a full proxy or DNS-only solution delivered through Cyren Cloud Security.

Intellectual Property
 
We regard our patented and patent pending anti-spam and antivirus technology, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights.
 
In 2004, we purchased a United States patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,330,590 that relates to the Recurrent Pattern Detection (RPD) technology used in many of our security solutions. During 2006, we filed a provisional patent application in the United States relating to the prevention of spam in streaming systems or, in other words, unwanted conversational media sessions (i.e., voice and video related). This provisional application was converted to a formal patent application and that application was then divided into three applications. The United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the original application as United States Patent No. 7,849,186. The three divisional patents were also subsequently granted as United States Patent No. 7,991,919, United States Patent No. 8,190,737 and United States Patent No. 8,195,795, all of which have a term concurrent with US Patent No. 7,849,186. In 2016, we filed a provisional patent application in the United States relating to a multi-sandbox array that utilizes unique intellectual property we developed in support of our cyber threat protection capabilities. In February 2017, we converted this provisional application into patent applications for the multi-sandbox array in the United States, Europe and Israel which are currently in various stages of prosecution. In July 2018 we filed a provisional patent application in the United States relating to phishing detection systems and methods we developed in support of our anti-phishing capabilities. We may seek to patent certain additional software or other technology in the future.
 
We have trademarks for our company name “Cyren” and we are also maintaining our registered trademark for “Commtouch”, which is registered in the U.S., Canada, Israel, European Union and China. Through acquisition, we also acquired registered trademarks such as “FRISK”, “F-PROT”, “eleven”, “Expurgate” and “Command Antimalware”. We may allow certain of these trademarks to lapse over time. Since at least September 2003, we have claimed common law trademark rights in “RPD” and “Recurrent Pattern Detection”, as applicable to our messaging security solutions. We have also been claiming common law trademark rights in “Zero-Hour” in relation to our virus outbreak detection product (and more recently one of our web security products) and “GlobalView” in relation to our Internet Protocol, or IP, reputation and web security products, as well as our “cloud computing” network infrastructure. 
 
It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States, Europe or elsewhere will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology.
 
Other parties may assert infringement claims against us. We may also be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement by us and/or our customers of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Our customer agreements typically include indemnity provisions so we may be obligated to defend against third party intellectual property rights infringement claims on behalf of our customers. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
 
Government Programs
 
Under the R&D Law, research and development programs approved by the Research Committee of the Israel Innovation Authority (respectively, the “Research Committee” and the “IIA”) are eligible for “Benefits” which include grants, loans, exemptions, discounts, guarantees and additional means of assistance, but with the exclusion of purchase of shares, provided under various tracks promulgated by the Council body (the “Tracks”). Most Tracks require the repayment of the Benefits in the form of the payment of royalties from the sale of the product developed in accordance with the published Track guidelines and subject to other restrictions. Once a project is approved, the IIA awards grants of up to 50% of the project’s expenditures in return for royalties, usually at the rate of 3% to 5% of sales of products developed with such grants. For projects approved after January 1, 1999, the amount of royalties payable was up to a dollar-linked amount equal to 100% of such grants plus interest at LIBOR. The Company’s total commitment for royalties payable with respect to future sales, based on IIA participations received, net of royalties paid or accrued, totaled $2,921 thousand as of December 31, 2018.
 
8

 

The terms of these grants prohibit the manufacturing outside of Israel of the product developed in accordance with the program without the prior consent of the Research Committee. Such approval is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the IIA to between 120% and 300% of the amount granted, depending on the extent of the manufacturing that is conducted outside of Israel.
 
The R&D Law, also provides that know-how from the research and development and any derivatives thereof, cannot be transferred or licensed to Israeli third parties without the approval of the Research Committee. The R&D Law stresses that it is not just transfer of know-how that was prohibited, but also transfer of any rights in such know-how. Approval of the transfer and/or license could be granted only if the Israeli transferee undertook to abide by all of the provisions of the R&D Law and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and the obligation to pay royalties, if applicable.
 
Assignment of the know-how from the research and development and any derivatives thereof, cannot be transferred or licensed to non-Israeli third parties without the approval of the Research Committee, which approval is generally contingent on payment of a significant penalty of up to six times the grant amount plus LIBOR and minus any royalties paid. Such restriction does not apply to exports from Israel of final products developed with such technologies. On May 7, 2017, the IIA published the Rules for Granting Authorization for Use of Know-How Outside of Israel (the “Licensing Rules”). The Licensing Rules enable the approval of out-licensing arrangements and other arrangements for granting of an authorization to an entity outside of Israel to use know-how developed under research and development programs funded by the IIA and any derivatives thereof. Subject to payment of a “License Fee” to the IIA, at a rate that will be determined by the IIA in accordance with the Licensing Rules, the IIA may now approve arrangements for the license of know-how outside of Israel. This allows companies that have received IIA support to commercialize know-how in a manner which was not previously available.
 
Government Regulation
 
Laws aimed at curtailing the spread of spam have been adopted by the United States federal government, i.e., the CAN-SPAM Act, and certain individual U.S. states, with the CAN-SPAM Act superseding some state laws or certain elements thereof. The Israel government has also adopted an amendment to the Communications Law, 1982, aimed at curtailing the spread of spam transmittal of commercial advertisements by email, fax, SMS or automated dialing systems without the consent of the recipient. The law sets punitive fines for advertisers of spam, who may also be subject to civil lawsuits and class actions. In addition, on June 21, 2017, the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority released a Directive that addresses direct mail and direct mail services, according to which the nature of the consent required for direct mail and direct mail services varies under the circumstances.
 
The propagation of email viruses, whether through email or websites, which are aimed at destroying or stealing third party data, is illegal under standard state and federal law outlawing theft, misappropriation, conversion, etc., without the need for special legislation prohibiting such activities on the internet. Despite the existence of these laws, sources for internet viruses continue to spread multi-variant viruses seemingly without much fear of recrimination. New laws providing for more stringent penalties could be adopted in various jurisdictions, but it is unclear what, if any, affect these would have on the antivirus industry in general and our solutions in particular.
 
On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor framework and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework. Subsequently, the U.S. and E.U. announced agreement on a new framework for transatlantic data flows entitled the EU-US Privacy Shield. We are currently certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework with the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, it is possible that Privacy Shield may be challenged in EU courts, so there is some uncertainty regarding its future validity and our ability to rely on it for EU to US data transfers. Additionally, the EU enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect on May 25, 2018 and carries with it significantly increased responsibilities and potential penalties for companies that process EU personal data. In connection with GDPR, we expect increased regulatory and customer attention surrounding data privacy in the EU. Furthermore, outside of the EU, we continue to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws, national laws regulating the collection and use of data, and security and data breach obligations. We have invested heavily in data sovereignty features to ensure that Cyren customer data is handled in accordance with applicable law.  If one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from Europe to the United States is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services.

We will continue to monitor legal requirements and will follow additional legal requirements for customer data privacy as they evolve.
 
Segments
 
The Company conducts its business on the basis of one reportable segment. 
 
Research and Development
 
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our products and services, build add-on functionality and improve our core technology. We believe that both hardware and software are critical to expanding our leadership in the security industry. Therefore, we invest heavily in our cloud infrastructure and our newer offerings such as CCS and CIS. Our engineering team has deep security expertise and works closely with customers to identify their current and future needs. In addition to our focus on hardware and software, our research and development team is focused on research into next-generation threats, which is required to respond to the rapidly changing threat landscape. We plan to continue to significantly invest in resources to conduct our research and development effort.
Customers 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had customers of all sizes across a wide variety of industries. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue
Competitive Landscape
 
The markets in which Cyren competes are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. However, we believe there are few competitors that offer the complete package of anti-spam, antivirus, threat intelligence, email security and web security protections that Cyren provides.
 
The principal competitive factors in our industry include price, product functionality, product integration, platform coverage and ability to scale, worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base. Additionally, some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines and services we market and distribute, possibly at a lower cost. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competing forces, to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors and/or to purchase new products by way of strategic acquisitions, and to educate potential OEM customers as to the benefits of using our products rather than developing their own products.
 
In the market for messaging security solutions, there are sophisticated offerings that compete with our solutions. Email defense security providers offering forms of Software-as-a-Service email gateways, multi-functional appliances and managed service solutions and which may be viewed as both competitors and potential customers to Cyren include Google, Symantec, McAfee, Cisco, Proofpoint, and Mimecast. Messaging security providers offering solutions on an OEM basis similar to Cyren’s business model, and which may be viewed as direct competitors, include Proofpoint (via the Cloudmark acquisition), Sophos, Mailshell and Vade Secure.
 
The market for real-time virus protection products is also constantly evolving, as those designing and proliferating viruses and other malware seek new vulnerabilities and distribution techniques, and also continue to leverage email distribution as a cost-effective medium for accurately targeting broad, numerous potential victims. Cyren’s real-time offering differs from traditional antivirus solutions by leveraging our global footprint and patented RPD technology to rapidly detect outbreaks, often hours or days before traditional antimalware solutions; it thereby offers a complementary solution to signature and heuristic-based antivirus engines. For this reason, our virus outbreak detection engine has been deployed by many security companies and service providers.
 
10

 

In the market for antimalware solutions, there are vendors offering fairly effective solutions using various technologies based on signatures, emulation and heuristics. Cyren has a targeted OEM/service provider focus, plus an increasing focus on heuristics and zero day effectiveness. Most companies in this space provide endpoint products and in some cases make software development kits available on an OEM basis. Competitors to Cyren include Sophos, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec and open source software such as ClamAV (now part of Cisco Talos Intelligence Group).  
 
In the market for web security solutions, there are advanced offerings that compete with our GlobalView URL filtering solution and CWS. Web security providers offering forms of software (secure web gateway), multi-functional appliances and managed service solutions and which may be viewed as both competitors and potential customers to Cyren include McAfee, ForcePoint, Symantec, Zscaler, Barracuda, and Cisco. Web security providers offering solutions on an OEM basis similar to Cyren’s business model, and which may be viewed as direct competitors, include Webroot (Carbonite), Netstar and zvelo.
 
We expect that the markets for internet security solutions will continue to become more consolidated, with companies increasing their presence in this market or entering ancillary markets by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors or business partners. 2018 saw a number of notable M&A transactions in the security sector, and industry analysts such as Momentum Cyber reported over 180 M&A deals totaling over $15 billion in transaction volume. See also disclosure under “Risk Factors—Business Risks— we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 
Threat Landscape
 
The last 12 months period has possibly experienced the greatest amount of dramatic global incidents directly related to malware and cyber threats since the advent of the internet. From election hacks to global ransomware attacks, malware threats are at an all-time high. As long as these activities prove lucrative, we expect these incidents to get worse.
 
In this “cyber-war”, with respect specifically to malware, three battlefronts stand out: ransomware, hyper-evasive malware, and malware distribution via HTTPS.
 
Ransomware has become especially lucrative for cybercriminals. Massive scale ransomware attacks have spread extremely quickly around the globe targeting governments, corporations, and private citizens. With hyper-evasive malware, cybercriminals are using codes designed to specifically detect and evade conventional sandbox detection and analysis. With respect to encrypted HTTPS traffic from “secure” web sites, a 2017 Cyren study of traffic passing through the Cyren security cloud found that almost 40% of all malware being disseminated is utilizing HTTPS connections for distribution or communications, yet surveys show that many companies around the globe are not inspecting that traffic. 
 
It has become clear that cybercriminals know the weak points in standard corporate defenses, and are optimizing their attacks to leverage these security gaps in every possible way.
 
Today, no item or user connected to the internet is immune to attack. While many businesses are still studying what security measures might be necessary, cybercriminals are “all in”, creating dangerous new tools to target companies, governments, and private citizens. We need to be mindful that the world has changed, hyper-evasive malware and threat distribution via HTTPS are growing rapidly; mobile devices — both Android and Apple — are increasingly targets; and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, from refrigerators to televisions, are an inviting new vector for criminal purposes.

Cloud and Mobility
 
Businesses are going through a massive change in their IT strategies as they look to drive more business value, agility, and better customer experiences.
 

● | Business internet traffic continues to increase every year – executives, employees, partners, contractors and customers are accustomed to transacting online. As a result, individuals are far more comfortable opening emails, clicking on links and providing sensitive data and information without questioning the authenticity of the applicable request. The simple organic growth in this usage of the internet is taxing existing legacy appliance solutions that have built-in capacity restrictions limiting their ability to scale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data and applications are increasingly moving to the cloud – where we used to protect the servers, data and applications we ran in our data centers behind an appliance-based security perimeter, today these apps and data have moved outside of this security perimeter and into the cloud.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More and more users are working remotely -- users have left the perimeter, and are working from home offices, airports, hotels, and coffee shops, accessing the internet without protection from our perimeter security appliances.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As organizations go through this transition, many are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their users, data and networks with traditional on-premise security solutions.
 

● | Buyers continue to move away from traditional on-premise solutions -- preference for service-based security solutions are growing, driven by innovations, increasing need for security beyond the perimeter, and lower total cost of ownership.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mature and legacy on premise deployments are reaching end of life -- and these are increasingly being replaced by SaaS alternatives.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IT security staffing shortages – driving products with lower management overhead, as well as some outsourcing to key technology partners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasingly fast, sophisticated, expensive and high-profile attacks target organizations of all sizes – attacks are increasingly focused on small companies, less-regulated and less-security aware industries, dictating increased security investment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance and regulatory mandates are creating increased concern among buyers, especially as the cost of failure becomes more painful. Continued, large-scale breaches — themselves a driver for security purchases — will bring about even more stringent levels of regulation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Heightened cybercrime activity among commercial enterprises and nation states – political and economic motivations are driving cyberattacks of both private enterprises and government entities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automation is increasingly considered critical to accelerating detection and protection, and to countering IT talent shortages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These reasons explain why Cyren’s vision for 100% cloud security is compelling to IT security teams looking to protect their businesses in today’s cloud-centric mobile-first world.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 278 total employees and 248 full-time employees.
 
While employment-related issues occasionally arise in the normal course, we believe that, on the whole, relations with our employees are good.
 
None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, rather they sign individual offer letters of employment that, along with relevant Company policies and an employee handbook, formalize employees’ relationship with our U.S. subsidiary. In Israel, certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists’ Associations) are applicable to our employees in Israel by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, which extends such collective bargaining agreements to Israeli employers. These provisions primarily concern the length of the workweek, travel expended, and pension fund benefits for all employees. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions above the required minimums.
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated as a private company under the laws of the State of Israel on February 10, 1991 and our legal form is a company limited by shares. We became a public company on July 15, 1999 under the name Commtouch Software Ltd. In January 2014, we changed our legal name to Cyren Ltd. Our website is https://www.cyren.com.
 
 Effective January 1, 2019, we ceased to be a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, and became subject to the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, we are filing an Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Our annual reports for prior years were filed on Form 20-F.
 
On December 25, 2017, Warburg Pincus completed a special tender offer in which it purchased 16,991,212 ordinary shares of the Company and, therefore, became the owner of a total of 27,586,733 ordinary shares, which represents 51% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of February 28, 2019.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 10 Ha-Menofim St., 5th Floor, Herzliya, Israel 4672561, where our telephone number is +972–9–863–6888.
