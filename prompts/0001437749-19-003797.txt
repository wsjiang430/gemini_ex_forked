Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General
 
First Community Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”), a financial holding company, was founded in 1989 and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 2018. The Company is the successor to First Community Bancshares, Inc., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reincorporation and Merger, the sole purpose of which was to change the Company’s state of incorporation from Nevada to Virginia. The reincorporation was completed on October 2, 2018. The Company’s principal executive office is located at One Community Place, Bluefield, Virginia. The Company provides banking products and services to individual and commercial customers through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank (the “Bank”), a Virginia-chartered banking institution founded in 1874. The Bank operates as First Community Bank in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina and People’s Community Bank, a Division of First Community Bank, in Tennessee. The Bank offers wealth management and investment advice through its Trust Division and wholly owned subsidiary First Community Wealth Management. Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms “First Community,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to First Community Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity.

--+--------------------------------

 
Our operations are guided by a strategic plan that focuses on organic growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions of complementary financial institutions. For a summary of our financial performance, see Item 6, “Selected Financial Data,” in Part II of this report.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 519 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by collective bargaining agreements and we consider employee relations to be excellent.
 
Market Area
 
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 44 branch locations in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee through our sole operating segment, Community Banking. Economic indicators in our market areas show relatively stable employment and business conditions. We serve a diverse base of individuals and businesses across a variety of industries such as education, government, and health services; coal mining and gas extraction; retail trade; construction; manufacturing; tourism; and transportation.
Competition
 
The financial services industry is highly competitive and constantly evolving. We encounter strong competition in attracting and retaining deposit, loan, and other financial relationships in our market areas. We compete with other commercial banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage banking firms, commercial finance and leasing companies, securities firms, brokerage firms, and insurance companies. We have positioned ourselves as a regional community bank that provides an alternative to larger banks, which often place less emphasis on personal relationships, and smaller community banks, which lack the capital and resources to efficiently serve customer needs. Factors that influence our ability to remain competitive include the ability to develop, maintain, and build long-term customer relationships; the quality, variety, and pricing of products and services; the convenience of banking locations and office hours; technological developments; and industry and general economic conditions. We seek to mitigate these pressures with our relationship style of banking, competitive pricing, cost efficiencies, and disciplined approach to loan underwriting.

Supervision and Regulation
 
Overview
 
We are subject to extensive examination, supervision, and regulation under applicable federal and state laws and various regulatory agencies. These regulations are intended to protect consumers, depositors, borrowers, deposit insurance funds, and the stability of the financial system and are not for the protection of stockholders or creditors.
 
Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments and impose conditions and requirements on the products and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our banking subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy requirements on the Company and the Bank. The consequences of noncompliance with these laws and regulations can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.
 
The following discussion summarizes significant laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. These summaries are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable statute or regulation. Changes in laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 
First Community Bankshares, Inc.
 
The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (“BHC Act”) and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLB Act”). The Company elected financial holding company status in December 2006. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). The BHC Act generally provides for umbrella regulation of financial holding companies, such as the Company, by the Federal Reserve, as well as functional regulation of financial holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve is granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of, examine, and adopt rules applicable to any bank holding company subsidiary.
 
The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (“Exchange Act”), as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol FCBC and is subject to NASDAQ’s rules for listed companies.
 
First Community Bank
 
The Bank is a Virginia chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) of Richmond. The Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the Bank’s business, including requirements concerning the allowance for loan losses, lending and mortgage operations, interest rates received on loans and paid on deposits, the payment of dividends, loans to affiliates, mergers and acquisitions, capital, and the establishment of branches. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect the Bank’s operations.
 
As a member bank, the Bank is required to hold stock in the FRB of Richmond in an amount equal to 6% of its capital stock and surplus (half paid to acquire the stock with the remainder held as a cash reserve). Member banks do not have any control over the Federal Reserve as a result of owning the stock and the stock cannot be sold or traded.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) of 2010 significantly restructured the U.S. financial regulatory regime. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive, complicated, and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, including the following provisions:

● | centralizes responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requires financial holding companies, such as the Company, to be well-capitalized and well-managed (bank holding companies and banks must also be well-capitalized and well-managed to engage in interstate bank acquisitions);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 5



● | imposes comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institutions themselves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implements corporate governance revisions, including executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules about interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and enforces a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increases the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine bank holding companies, such as the Company, and their non-bank subsidiaries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by applicable federal regulators. We continue to evaluate the impact of any new regulations.
 
Permitted Activities under the BHC Act
 
The BHC Act limits the activities of bank holding companies, such as the Company, to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking. A bank holding company that elects treatment as a financial holding company under the GLB Act, such as the Company, may engage in a broader range of activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system. These activities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking.
 
In order to maintain financial holding company status, the Company and the Bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed under applicable Federal Reserve regulations and have received at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). See “Prompt Corrective Action” and “Community Reinvestment Act” below. If we fail to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements and place limitations or conditions on our ability to conduct activities permissible for financial holding companies. If the deficiencies persist, the Federal Reserve may require the Company to divest the Bank or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies.
 
The Company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, subject to certain exemptions, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation.
 
The BHC Act requires that bank holding companies obtain the Federal Reserve’s approval before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or all, or substantially all, of the assets of a bank. The regulatory authorities are required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the target bank, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and various competitive factors when approving acquisitions. The BHC Act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company engaged in a non-banking business unless the Federal Reserve determines it to be closely related to banking.
 
Capital Requirements
 
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. The current risk-based capital requirements are based on the December 2010 international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”), known as Basel III.
 
On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved capital rules for U.S. banking organizations implementing Basel III (“Basel III Capital Rules”) and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules. Basel III Capital Rules (1) introduced a new Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital measure, (2) specified that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements, (3) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (4) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. The following initial minimum capital ratios became effective, subject to a phase-in period, for the Company and the Bank under Basel III Capital Rules on January 1, 2015:
 

● | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets
--+----------------------------------


● | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio
--+---------------------------

Basel III Capital Rules introduced a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer was implemented on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% and was phased in over a four-year period (increased an additional 0.625% each year until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019). Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer that applies to certain covered institutions; however, the buffer does not apply to the Company or the Bank. Banking institutions with a CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, if applicable) face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 
When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, Basel III Capital Rules will require an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in the following minimum ratios:
 

● | 7.0% CET1 to risk-weighted assets
--+----------------------------------


● | 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
--+--------------------------------------------


● | 10.5% Total capital to risk-weighted assets
--+--------------------------------------------


● | 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio
--+---------------------------

 
In August 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule, which expanded the applicability of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement through an increase in the size limitation for qualifying bank holding companies from $1 billion to $3 billion in total consolidated assets. As a result, the Company qualifies under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement for exemption from the Federal Reserve’s consolidated risk-based capital requirements at the holding company level. Management believes that the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis, if such requirements were in effect, as of December 31, 2018.
 
Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015, at 40% and were phased in over a four-year period (increasing an additional 20% each year until it reached 100% on January 1, 2018).
 
Basel III Capital Rules prevent certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. The rules do not require a phase-out of trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010, for holding companies of depository institutions with less than $15 billion in consolidated total assets, as of December 1, 2009.
 
Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 
The federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital-deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if the appropriate federal regulators determine that it is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s financial condition or prospects for other purposes.

The Bank was classified as well-capitalized under prompt corrective action regulations as of December 31, 2018. In order to be considered a well-capitalized institution under Basel III Capital Rules, an organization must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive and must maintain the following minimum capital ratios:
 

● | 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets
--+----------------------------------


● | 8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
--+--------------------------------------------


● | 10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets
--+--------------------------------------------


● | 5.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio
--+---------------------------

 
Undercapitalized institutions are required to submit a capital restoration plan to federal banking regulators. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must provide appropriate assurances of performance and guarantee that its subsidiary bank will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. Agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions, including asset growth, acquisitions, establishing branches, and engaging in new lines of business. With certain exceptions, a depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to its parent holding company if the institution would be undercapitalized after such distribution or payment.
 
A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to various requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and ending deposits from correspondent banks. The FDIC has limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is generally required to appoint a receiver or conservator.
 
Safety and Soundness Standards
 
Guidelines adopted by federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage risks and exposures. If an institution fails to meet safety and soundness standards, the regulatory agencies may require the institution to submit a written compliance plan describing the steps they would take to correct the situation and the time that such steps would be taken. If an institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable compliance plan, after being notified, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions, such as those applicable to undercapitalized institutions under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA. An institution may be subject to judicial proceedings and civil money penalties if it fails to follow such an order.
Payment of Dividends
 
The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The Company’s principal source of cash flow is derived from dividends paid by the Bank. There are various restrictions by regulatory agencies related to dividends paid by the Bank to the Company and dividends paid by the Company to its shareholders. The payment of dividends by the Company and the Bank may be limited by certain factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guideline minimums.
 
Prior FRB approval is required for the Bank to declare or pay a dividend to the Company if the total of all dividends declared in any given year exceed the total of the Bank’s net profits for that year and its retained profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Dividends paid by the Company to shareholders are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve policy states that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only from income available over the past year if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs, asset quality, and financial condition.
 
Regulatory agencies have the authority to limit or prohibit the Company and the Bank from paying dividends if the payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only from current operating earnings. In addition, the Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank would be classified as undercapitalized. In the current financial and economic environment, the FRB has discouraged payout ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are very strong, and has noted that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy. Bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries.

Source of Strength
 
Federal Reserve policy and federal law requires the Company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank even when it may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, any capital loans it makes to the Bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
Transactions with Affiliates
 
The Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”) and Federal Reserve Regulation W place restrictions on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its affiliates, including the Company. The term “covered transactions” includes making loans, purchasing assets, issuing guarantees, and other similar transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the definition of “covered transactions” to include derivative activities, repurchase agreements, and securities lending or borrowing activities. These restrictions limit the amount of transactions with affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliates, and require that all transactions with affiliates be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, these transactions must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for similar transactions with non-affiliates.
 
The FRA and Federal Reserve Regulation O place restrictions on loans between the Company and the Bank and their directors, executive officers, principal shareholders, affiliates, and interests of those directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders. These restrictions limit the amount of loans to one borrower and require that loans are on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for similar loans with non-insiders. In addition, the aggregate limit of loans to all insiders, as a group, cannot exceed the Bank’s total unimpaired capital and surplus.
 
Deposit Insurance and Assessments
 
Substantially all of the Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC and are subject to quarterly deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance premiums are assessed using a risk-based system that places FDIC-insured institutions into one of four risk categories based on capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. The assessment rate determined by considering such information is then applied to the institution's average assets minus average tangible equity to determine the institution's insurance premium. The FDIC may change assessment rates or revise its risk-based assessment system if deemed necessary to maintain an adequate reserve ratio for the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act required that the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance assessments were $840 thousand in 2018, $797 thousand in 2017, and $1.25 million in 2016.
 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions must pay annual assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). The FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The Bank’s FICO assessments, which are set quarterly, were $66 thousand in 2018, $113 thousand in 2017, and $124 thousand in 2016.
 
The Volcker Rule
 
The Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHC Act to prohibit depository institutions and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, known as the Volcker Rule. These prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions, restrictions, and definitions. The Volcker Rule became effective on April 1, 2014, but the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for certain requirements to July 21, 2017. Upon application of a banking entity, the Federal Reserve may provide an additional transition period of up to 5 years to conform investments in a limited class of legacy illiquid funds. The Volcker Rule has not had a material effect on the operations of the Company and subsidiaries, as the Company does not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. The Company may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but any such costs are not expected to be material.
 
 9


Community Reinvestment Act
 
The CRA of 1977, as amended, requires depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of their market areas, including low- and moderate-income individuals and communities, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Federal banking regulators periodically examine depository institutions and assign ratings based on CRA compliance. A rating of less than satisfactory may restrict certain operating activities, delay or deny certain transactions, or result in an institution losing its financial holding company status. The Bank received a rating of satisfactory in its most recent CRA examination.
Incentive Compensation
 
Federal regulatory agencies have issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance is based on the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
 
Federal banking regulators periodically examine the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations and incorporate any deficiencies in the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect certain operating activities. The FRB may initiate enforcement actions if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control, or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. It cannot be determined at this time if or when a final rule will be adopted or if compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.
 
Anti-Tying Restrictions
 
The Bank and its affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by the Company.
 
Consumer Protection and Privacy
 
We are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations include the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Fair Housing Act, and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations contain extensive customer privacy protection provisions that limit the ability of financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties and require financial institutions to disclose certain policies to consumers.
 
The CFPB is a federal agency with broad authority to implement, examine, and enforce compliance with federal consumer protection laws that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage, and other consumer financial products and services. The CFPB may enforce actions to prevent and remedy unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices related to consumer financial products and services. The agency has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. The CFPB may impose a civil penalty or injunction against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial laws.
 
Cybersecurity
 
In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements about cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Bank fails to observe the regulatory guidance, the Bank could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
 
 10


Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering
 
The Bank is subject to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (“USA PATRIOT Act”) of 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation by imposing new compliance and due diligence obligations focused on detecting and reporting money laundering transactions. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of our customers. Violations can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s (“Treasury”) Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them, and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, financial, and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities to not approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX Act”) of 2002 addresses a broad range of corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and disclosure requirements for public companies and their directors and officers. The SOX Act requires our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to certify the accuracy of certain information included in our quarterly and annual reports. The rules require these officers to certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; that they have made certain disclosures to the auditors and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our controls and procedures; and that they have included information in their quarterly and annual filings about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes to the controls and procedures or other factors which would significantly impact these controls subsequent to their evaluation. Section 404 of the SOX Act requires management to undertake an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and requires our auditors to attest to and report on the effectiveness of these controls.
