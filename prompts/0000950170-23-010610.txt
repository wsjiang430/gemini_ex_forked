 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases. We believe cell therapies are one of the forward pillars of medicine, and our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective and more broadly accessible. Although cell therapies have shown benefits to date, cell therapies have historically been constrained to existing biologic structures, which has limited their impact and opportunity. Our novel synthetic binding scaffold, the D-Domain, is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts). Existing cell therapy solutions, most of which use a biologic-based, single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domain, tend to be difficult to manufacture, beneficial to a limited segment of patients, often result in high toxicity, and have narrow applicability in treatable indications. We believe we can address these limitations by engineering a new class of D-Domain powered cell therapies, including classical single infusion CAR-Ts called “ddCARs” and dosable and controllable universal CAR-Ts called “ARC-SparX”, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, and indications outside of oncology, such as autoimmune diseases. Our lead program is a BCMA-targeting ddCAR product candidate called “CART-ddBCMA”, which is currently being evaluated in our pivotal Phase 2 “iMMagine-1” trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM). We have partnered CART-ddBCMA with Kite Pharma Inc., a Gilead company (Kite), through our co-development/co-commercialization collaboration agreement, as described in more detail in “Licenses and Collaborations” below (the Kite Collaboration Agreement). We also are developing two clinical-stage ARC-SparX programs in Phase 1 trials; ACLX-001, which targets BCMA in rrMM, and ACLX-002, which targets CD123 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Outside of multiple myeloma (MM), we continue to advance our wholly-owned portfolio of clinical-stage (i.e., ACLX-002) and preclinical pipeline programs incorporating our D-Domain technology.
In December 2022, at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), we presented positive preliminary results in our Phase 1 clinical trial for CART-ddBCMA for the treatment of rrMM. We believe these results demonstrate that our D-Domain technology can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefits. As of the October 31, 2022 data cutoff date, 38 patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy analysis, which required at least a 1-month follow-up visit per protocol using the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria for MM. For more information regarding the 2016 IMWG uniform response criteria for MM, see the section entitled “Our Multiple Myeloma Program” below. These evaluable patients comprised the dose escalation cohorts for the first dose level (DL1) (n=6) and the second dose level (DL2) (n=6) and a dose expansion cohort of DL1 (n=26).
 Key highlights from the data presented are as follows:
 •Of the 38 evaluable patients:
 •100% overall response rate (ORR) achieved per IMWG criteria with median follow up of 15 months;
 •27 of 38 (71%) patients achieved complete response (CR) or a stringent complete response (sCR);
 •7 of 38 (18%) patients achieved very good partial response (VGPR); and
 •4 of 38 (11%) patients achieved a partial response (PR).
 •Of the 16 patients who were dosed at least 18 months prior or have had their 18-month follow-up visit by November 22, 2022:
 •13 (81%) patients had high-risk prognostic features; and
 •13 (81%) patients reached CR/sCR.
 •Of the 25 patients who were dosed at least 12 months prior or have had their 12-months follow-up visit by November 22, 2022:
 •19 (76%) patients had high-risk prognostic features; and
 •20 (80%) patients reached CR/sCR.


•Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, which calculates the cumulative survival probability in any given length of time through analysis of subjects who have died or dropped out within certain time intervals:
 •Progression-free survival (PFS) rates, which reflect the percentage of patients who are alive and have not progressed, at 6, 12 and 18 months were 92%, 73% and 65%, respectively;
 •PFS rates of patients with high-risk prognostic features at 6, 12 and 18 months were 91%, 69% and 63%, respectively; and
 •PFS rates among patients with extra-medullary disease (EMD) at 6, 12 and 18 months were 92%, 64% and 64%, respectively.
 •CART-ddBCMA dosed at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 115 (+/-10) million CAR+T-cells, which was evaluated in DL1, continues to be well-tolerated.
•Adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), have been manageable, and each event was resolved with standard management.
 •No cases of delayed neurotoxicity events or parkinsonian symptoms have been observed through November 22, 2022.
 •No cases of grade 3 (or greater) CRS and only one case (3%) of grade 3 ICANS have been observed with no additional cases observed through November 22, 2022. 
 Of the 38 lots of CART-ddBCMA associated with patients for which preliminary clinical data from our Phase 1 clinical trial was reported, cell product for CART-ddBCMA has thus far had a mean viability of 98%, a mean percent CAR+ rate of 69%, and a mean yield of over one billion cells, more than sufficient for the RP2D of 115 (+/- 10) million cells.
 Overall, patients enrolled in the trial had poor prognostic factors with 26 of 38 (68%) patients being penta-refractory and all 38 patients being triple refractory, with a median of four prior lines of therapy. 11 of 38 (29%) patients had high-risk cytogenetics and 20 of 38 (53%) patients were aged 65 or older at time of dosing. Of the patients enrolled in the trial, 22 of 38 (58%) patients had at least one of the following high-risk prognostic features: (a) having greater than or equal to 60% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC), which are the malignant cells that cause multiple myeloma, (b) being at Stage III as defined by the Multiple Myeloma International Staging System (ISS) which is defined as having a serum ß2 micro globulin (B2M) value that is greater than or equal to 5.5 mg/L, or (c) having extra-medullary disease (EMD). A high percentage of BMPC and a high value of serum B2M are known biomarkers of poor prognosis and associated with increased tumor burden in MM clinical trials and observational studies. EMD is a condition in which myeloma cells form tumors outside the bone and bone marrow, involving one or more organs, including the liver, lymph nodes, skin, lungs, and central nervous system. EMD is also associated with worse prognosis, and patients with EMD or these other high-risk prognostic features have been reported to experience lower CR rates and shorter duration of response (DOR) in clinical trials of other BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies. All patients enrolled scored 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale and the subtypes of MM were representative of the natural distribution of MM subtypes, with about two-thirds having IgG myeloma.
 We believe the preliminary results from our Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA in an enrolled population with poor prognostic indicators demonstrate the potential for CART-ddBCMA to become a best-in-class treatment for patients suffering from rrMM, including those considered high risk. MM is the third most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe, with approximately 35,000 new cases diagnosed per year in the United States. Although changes in the treatment landscape for MM have increased the rates of and depth of response (antitumor activity), there is currently no cure, neither approved or in clinical development, for MM; and patients typically have a life expectancy of just over five years. In 2021, the size of the global MM market was approximately $20 billion. We estimate the current total addressable CAR-T market for rrMM to be $12 billion or more based on the number of patients who are receiving second line treatments and beyond.
 In November 2022, we announced the initiation of our pivotal iMMagine-1 Phase 2 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA in rrMM, which followed the completion of activities and submission of IND amendments for the technical transfer of our cell manufacturing and vector supply to Lonza Houston, Inc. and Oxford Biomedica, respectively, for our pivotal trial. Based on our current discussions with the FDA, we believe that results from our iMMagine-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, if positive, together with the results from our Phase 1 trial could be sufficient to support the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and

Drug Administration (FDA). We also intend to rapidly pursue clinical development of CART-ddBCMA in earlier lines of therapy through our iMMagine-2 Phase 3 clinical trial. As described in more detail in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Kite to co-develop and co-commercialize CART-ddBCMA as well as other autologous and non-autologous CAR-T cell therapies that use the same D-domain BCMA binder for the treatment of MM, pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement.
 
* Kite retains an option for select ARC-SparX programs in multiple myeloma.
 We have summarized our preclinical and clinical programs in the pipeline chart above and indicated where such programs are subject to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, which is described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below. Except for such partnered programs, we have worldwide rights to all our programs.
We are also advancing our novel ARC-SparX programs, including our clinical-stage programs, ACLX-001 in rrMM and wholly-owned ACLX-002 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ARC-SparX are adaptable versions of ddCARs where the antigen-targeting region is located on a SparX protein that can be dosed separately from the ARC-T cells, our proprietary D-Domain based universal CAR-T-cells that are designed to activate only when bound to a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell. We believe that controlling ARC-T activation with SparX protein effectively separates the antigen-recognition and killing functions, which allows for a more controlled, modular approach to CAR-T therapy, as SparX dosing may be modified over the course of treatment to reduce toxicities, multiple SparX proteins may be incorporated to address antigen heterogeneity, and additional functionality (i.e., logic-gating) may be designed to expand the utility of CAR-T therapy. Further, the approach has potential to simplify the manufacturing and the regulatory path of multiple CAR-T programs, as the ARC-T programs can utilize the same vector and express the same binding domain. Our preclinical studies of our ARC-SparX product candidates have demonstrated that ARC-T cells can be activated by different SparX proteins that target different antigens suggesting that ARC-SparX can potentially address antigen heterogeneity, and thereby address some harder to treat indications.
 We initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of ACLX-001, the first product candidate developed under our ARC-SparX platform, for the treatment of rrMM in the second quarter of 2022. ACLX-001 is an immunotherapeutic combination composed of our ARC-T-cells and SparX proteins that target BCMA. This trial is intended to establish an ARC-SparX dosing regimen and prepare for ARC-SparX trials in expanded indications. Our lead ARC-SparX indication is AML/MDS, for which we have multiple SparX in

development targeting different antigens. We initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial for ACLX-002, an ARC-SparX product candidate targeting CD123, for the treatment of AML/MDS in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 We have built a broad and scalable pipeline that positions us to capitalize on the potential of our proprietary platform technologies and potentially achieve long-term growth and sustainability within the field of cell therapy. We believe our therapeutic approaches, ddCAR and ARC-SparX, will enable us to select mechanisms that are most appropriate for each target and indication we may choose to pursue based on underlying disease biology and patient need, such as in solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We are also integrating AI-powered discovery and computational tools to expand the applicability of our platforms.
 





Our D-Domain platform has broad potential utility for additional cell modalities, targets, therapeutic areas and applications and we plan to expand our pipeline beyond hematologic and solid cancers to autoimmune disease, as well as to allogeneic and other cell types, including through our collaboration with Kite. We believe our preliminary Phase 1 clinical data for CART-ddBCMA have demonstrated that D-Domains can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefits. Our D-Domain platform consists of structurally unique binders that are small and stable. They can be consistently manufactured and modified to generate diverse libraries of proprietary target- binding domains. The small size and structure of our D-Domain binders compared to other antigen binding domains used in CAR constructs, such as scFvs, are illustrated above. In our preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that CARs with D-Domains exhibit higher transduction efficiency, higher surface expression, and lower tonic signaling than CARs with scFvs, which we believe can lead to cell therapies with improved therapeutic benefit and reduced toxicity. From our Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA, we reported preliminary data that we believe supports efficacy and safety benefits, as well as potential manufacturability advantages associated with our D-Domain technology.
The recent availability of cell therapy products, such as CAR-T-cells, introduced an unprecedented “living therapeutic” modality that offers benefits well beyond what previous oncology modalities offered. For the first time, these therapeutics directly harness the strength of the patient’s own immune system to significantly reduce, even potentially eradicate, tumors. While CAR-T and other genetically modified cell therapies have shown significant progress in extending or improving the lives of patients who often have no other treatment options, there are limitations to their broader use, including:
•Variable Long-Term Efficacy: FDA-approved CAR-Ts may offer higher response rates compared to other available therapies, but efficacy as measured by the DOR is highly variable between different CAR-T programs and also within the same program for different patients. Further, unmet need remains for patients with high-risk prognostic features, such as EMD within rrMM, who experience worse outcomes in clinical trials of other BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies than non-EMD patients, and often do not achieve deep, durable responses. 


•Significant Adverse Effects: These cell therapies also have the potential to cause several adverse effects. Uncontrolled cellular expansion and resulting side effects such as CRS, neurotoxicity, parkinsonian symptoms and “on-target, off-tumor” toxicities stifle the broader use of these therapies in several key ways. Specifically, they limit the number of patients that are eligible for treatment, relegate these therapies to later lines of treatment, preclude the use of these therapies in the non-academic and outpatient settings, and increase costs to patients, payers and providers due to the need for intensive care unit access when they are used. 
 •Narrow Applicability: Currently, CAR-T and other genetically modified cell therapies are utilized in only a few hematological oncology indications. Their activity in most tumors is primarily driven by a limited number of tumor specific antigen targets. Their utility is further limited by secondary resistance mechanisms arising in the relapsed or refractory settings, as well as the antigen heterogeneity that is characteristic of some of these diseases. 
 •Limited Access:  Due to the potential for severe toxicities, the limited number of safe and efficacious targets, supply constraints due to manufacturing complexity and scalability of processes, length of the regulatory process, and the substantial capital requirements for bringing cell therapies to market at scale, CAR-Ts are still not widely available for oncology patients. Supply constraints have been specifically cited as a limiting factor for access to FDA-approved BCMA CAR-Ts since their launches. Further, FDA-approved CAR-Ts are primarily administered and managed in authorized treatment centers, which represent less than 7% of oncology/hematology practices in the United States.
 
 Our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective, and broadly accessible. We plan to achieve this goal by maximizing the impact of our proprietary D-Domain binders, which enable CAR-Ts to have distinct advantages including:
•Promising Preliminary Clinical Data- High ORR and Durable Responses: In our Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA, for the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy, we reported an ORR of 100% and the DOR is promising with more than half of the 25 patients with rrMM who were dosed at least 12 months prior or have had their 12-month follow-up visit by November 22, 2022 still remaining in ongoing response with a median follow up of 19 months. We believe these preliminary results demonstrate the capability of D-Domains not only to effectively bind target antigens and drive CAR-T cell proliferation but also to enable efficient killing of a substantial proportion of tumor cells. High cell surface expression and low propensity for tonic signaling of D-Domains may enable more effective interactions between the CAR and the antigen as well as reduced T-cell exhaustion, which may explain the rapid and long-term responses currently observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial, despite a highly pre-treated, refractory patient population. 
 •Potentially Differentiated Safety Profile: We believe the small and stable structure of the D-Domain enables a high transduction rate, resulting in a high proportion of cells expressing the CAR construct on the cell surface (CAR+ cells), as we observed in our Phase 1 trial of CART-ddBCMA. A high proportion of CAR+ cells lowers the total number of T-cells required to be administered which we believe may yield a therapy with an improved toxicity profile, consistent with currently available results of the Phase 1 trial of CART-ddBCMA. A recent cross-trial safety analysis on CAR-Ts by the FDA supports this concept, finding lower transduction frequency in the CAR-T product was significantly associated with higher rates of severe CRS. 
 •Opportunity to Treat a Broader Group of Cancer Patients: We believe the preliminary positive results of our Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA underscores the advantages conferred by our D-Domain binders, which may be applicable across a wide variety of tumor antigen targets in the future. Based on the differentiation of the D-Domain, and the breadth and depth of our D-Domain libraries, we believe we can expand to a broader group of patients, including those with heterogeneous tumor antigen expression and antigen targets that might be difficult to target. We are currently developing therapies within both our ddCAR and ARC-SparX platforms to treat a broad variety of indications, starting with rrMM and AML/MDS and, in the future, solid tumors. 
•Potential Advantages from D-Domain Manufacturability and Experienced CAR-T Partner: We believe the manufacturing data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA demonstrate the potential manufacturing advantages conferred by D-Domains vs. scFv and biologics-based constructs used in CAR-T therapies. Along with the experience and established CAR-T infrastructure offered by our recent Kite Collaboration Agreement, which has resulted in high success rates and reliability in delivering their currently marketed products, we are encouraged by our combined potential to mitigate the supply constraints which have limited BCMA CAR-T launches to date. Further, the Kite Collaboration Agreement and the associated upfront consideration substantially limits our need for additional capital to build out commercial manufacturing infrastructure. 
 The foundation of our competitive advantage is our proprietary technology, clinical evidence, track record of execution, manufacturing success, and assembly of a proven management team. We believe these advantages, and our recent partnership around

our lead program CART-ddBCMA with global cell therapy leader, Kite, position us to achieve significant market share in a large and attractive market and to ultimately transform the cell therapy market, contributing to a significant advancement in medicine.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy to achieve our mission is as follows:
 •In collaboration with Kite, advance CART-ddBCMA to treat rrMM patients in the United States and abroad;
 •Develop comprehensive ARC-SparX AML/MDS program;
 •Expand our pipeline, including to select solid tumor indications and indications outside of oncology;
 •Apply our D-Domain technology outside of autologous CAR-T solutions, including through our collaboration with Kite;
 •Enable greater access to CAR-T therapy through clinical trials in broader patient populations that support improved market access;
 •Invest in building out infrastructure and technologies that lower customer friction, increase capacity and improve responsiveness;
 •Leverage AI, machine learning, and other novel technologies to drive our discovery efforts; and
 •Opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships and collaborations, such as our collaboration with Kite, to maximize the full potential of our platform.
 Our Team
 Our team and culture are critical to realizing our vision of reimagining cell therapy as one of the future pillars of medicine.
 We are led by a diverse team of executives with significant experience in business, discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of differentiated and novel therapies specifically in the fields of oncology, cell therapy and rare diseases. Rami Elghandour, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer at Nevro where he grew the company from a small private company to a publicly traded commercial organization with nearly $400 million in revenue. Prior to Nevro, Mr. Elghandour was an investor with Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation where he led several investments, including Nevro’s Series B financing. Our Chief Medical Officer, Christopher Heery, M.D., an oncologist by training, was the former Head of Clinical Trials Group for the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at the National Cancer Institute, and previously served as Chief Medical Officer at Precision Biosciences and Bavarian Nordic. Our Chief Financial Officer, Michelle Gilson, was previously a senior equity research analyst covering the biotechnology sector, most recently as a Managing Director at Canaccord Genuity. Our Chief Scientific Officer, David Tice, Ph.D., has over 20 years of biopharmaceutical research and drug development experience in oncology, including 18 years at MedImmune, the global biologics research and development unit of AstraZeneca.
 We have attracted a diverse and talented group of innovators and company builders to help us execute our strategy and to build a transformative cell therapy platform company. Collectively, we are driven by our shared purpose and our values.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 98 full-time employees and we are committed to continuing to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive organization. We believe focusing on diversity and inclusion is not only the right thing to do but is also a competitive advantage. We are purposeful in our efforts to seek and retain top diverse talent from underrepresented groups as reflected throughout our organization:
 •Total Company: 49% female; 73% diverse (gender, racial & ethnic representation);
 •Executives: 40% female; 60% diverse;
 •Managers and senior scientists with managerial responsibilities: 40% female; 63% diverse; 
 •Technical and Scientific roles: 50% female; 73% diverse; and


•Director roles: 32% female; 68% diverse.
 Diversity numbers are representative of both gender and ethnic diversity. Our commitment to diversity does not stop within the walls of our organization. With our mission of advancing humanity, we believe in equitable access to healthcare. Inclusive research programs that encompass real-world patient populations can contribute to addressing racial inequality in healthcare. We are dedicated to expanding representation within our clinical trials. We also believe deeply in corporate social responsibility and being conscious stewards in our society. We are devoted to leveraging our science to make a positive impact for the patient and local communities we serve. As our organization expands, we intend to grow our community involvement and outreach efforts and establish our corporate brand as a force for good through corporate philanthropy, patient advocacy, and employee volunteerism.
 Cell Therapy Background & Current Limitations
Background
T-cells are a key component of the immune system that can target diseased cells for elimination through the recognition of cell surface antigens. A growing understanding of the immune system over the years and advances in cell, gene and protein engineering have led to approved genetically modified cell therapy products.
Genetically modified cell therapy involves isolating immune cells, modifying them outside of the patient’s body and then reintroducing them into the patient to destroy diseased cells. Such cell therapies have largely focused on using the patient’s own T-cells (autologous approach) to express engineered antigen receptor complexes, such as TCRs or CARs. The extracellular binding domain of the TCR or CAR recognizes the antigen, and, after the T cell binds with the cell expressing the antigen, the intracellular signaling domain induces cell killing and activates pathways specific for the T cell’s proliferation and survival.
The recent availability of cell therapy products introduced an unprecedented “living therapeutic” modality that offers benefits well beyond what previous oncology modalities offered. For the first time, these therapeutics directly harness the strength of the patient’s own immune system to significantly reduce, even potentially eradicate, tumors. Initially evaluated in indications where patients were refractory to multiple lines of therapy and had generally exhausted their therapeutic options, adoptive cell therapies have shown response rates that exceed many other available modalities. Particularly striking is that these responses are achieved with a single, personalized administration of the cell therapy, generally achieving rapid and durable responses with toxicities resolving in days to weeks. This transformative therapy results in extended quality of life benefits without maintenance or additional treatment.
As of March 29, 2023 , there are six FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies: Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with rrMM after four or more prior lines of therapy; Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with rrMM after four or more prior lines of therapy; Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) that is refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy within 12 months or are also ineligible for stem cell transplantation, and relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy; Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy; Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL; and Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with LBCL that is refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, and relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.
Hematologic cancers represent a robust and growing market opportunity for CAR-T cell therapies. These cancers, which include leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, account for approximately 10% of all cancer incidence in 2020. Sales of CAR-T therapies in hematologic cancers exceeded $2.5 billion in 2022 and are expected to continue growing in 2023. We estimate that the total market opportunity for cell therapy in hematologic cancers is approximately $66 billion.
Current Limitations
While CAR-T and other genetically modified cell therapies have shown significant progress in extending the lives of patients who often have no other treatment options, there are limitations to their broader use, including:
•Variable Long-Term Efficacy: FDA-approved CAR-Ts may offer higher response rates compared to other available therapies, but efficacy as measured by the DOR is highly variable between different CAR-T programs and also within the same program for different patients. Further, unmet need remains for patients with high-risk prognostic features, such as EMD within rrMM, who experience worse outcomes in clinical trials of other BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies than non-EMD patients, and often do not achieve deep, durable responses.

We are currently developing therapies within both our ddCAR and ARC-SparX platforms to treat a broad variety of indications, starting with rrMM and AML/MDS and, in the future, solid tumors. 

•Potential Advantages from D-Domain Manufacturability and Experienced CAR-T Partner: We believe the manufacturing data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA demonstrate the potential manufacturing advantages conferred by D-Domains vs. scFv and biologics-based constructs used in CAR-T therapies. Along with the experience and established CAR-T infrastructure offered by our recent Kite Collaboration Agreement, which has resulted in high success rates and reliability in delivering their currently marketed products, we are encouraged by our combined potential to mitigate the supply constraints which have limited BCMA CAR-T launches to date. Further, the Kite Collaboration Agreement and the associated upfront consideration substantially limits our need for additional capital to build out commercial manufacturing infrastructure. 
 The foundation of our proprietary platforms is our D-Domain technology, that has generated promising initial clinical data. We believe our D-Domain technology is a transformational platform that enables us to take the right approach for the right indication within cell therapy. The strengths of the D-Domains are its size, stability, and structure which make it a unique and essential building block for making next generation CAR-Ts to unlock the potential of this therapeutic category which is poised to be one of the forward pillars of medicine. Our method of generating D-Domains, and the individual binders themselves are protected in our patent portfolio, which as of December 31, 2022, includes 18 U.S. and foreign patents and over 60 U.S. and foreign pending applications.
We are generating D-Domains against multiple targets which can then be deployed to create a new class of D-Domain powered cell therapies, including ddCAR and ARC-SparX CAR-T therapies, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, and indications outside of oncology such as autoimmune diseases. ddCARs are single infusion CAR-Ts enhanced with our D-Domains as the antigen recognition motif. ARC-SparX are adaptable versions of ddCARs where the SparX protein is dosed separately from the ARC-T cell. Our ARC-T-cells are dosable, controllable, universal CAR-Ts designed to activate only when combined with a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell.



ddCAR Platform
We use our ddCAR platform to generate single infusion therapies where our D-Domain binder replaces the scFvs. The ddCAR is composed of an intracellular T cell signaling domain similar to traditional CARs fused to our D-Domain, which functions

as the extracellular antigen binding region. Upon engagement with the antigen on a target cell, the ddCAR signals to activate the T cell to kill the target cell.



The D-Domain was developed to overcome limitations of existing CAR-T therapies by employing a novel synthetic binding domain as a replacement to the traditionally used antigen binding domains for conventional CAR-T therapies, known as scFvs. The result is a structurally unique binder that is small, stable, and can be modified to generate a diverse library of proprietary target-binding domains.
Structurally Unique D-Domains: The unique structural features of our D-Domain may confer the unique combination of properties we observe in our ddCAR product candidates, such as high cell surface expression, high proportion of CAR+ cells (high transduction rate), and low tonic signaling, which we believe have contributed to the efficacy, safety, and manufacturability profile observed in our Phase 1 trial of our lead program CART-ddBCMA. D-Domains are short polypeptides that spontaneously fold into a stable triple alpha-helical structure. The D-Domain is derived from a 73 amino acid synthetic protein, α-3D, that has no known homolog in nature or apparent function as first described in a paper by Walsh, et al. that appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 1999. This domain is devoid of post-translational glycosylation or disulfide bonds leading to consistent manufacturability via microbial, fungal or mammalian protein expression. Additional key structural features of the D-Domain are as follows:
 •Small Size: The figure below showcases the small size of the 8kDa D-Domain compared to other antigen binding domains used in CAR constructs such as the scFv and bi-valent camelid VHh structure of approximately 25kDa. A smaller antigen binding domain will decrease the overall lentiviral construct size which may improve transduction efficiency. The small antigen binding domain may also function to improve the immunological synapse formation and thus CAR-T cell killing. 





•Hydrophobic Core: The figure below depicts the three-dimensional structure of the D-Domain highlighting the triple alpha helical bundle with the tight hydrophobic core (in red). The hydrophobic core results in ultrafast folding kinetics of the D-Domain creating a stable structure when expressed in cells. 
 


•Stability: D-Domains are highly stable proteins compared to scFvs which facilitates the high expression of CARs on T-cells and manufacturing of SparX proteins. As shown in the middle panels of the figure below, using size exclusion chromatography, we have demonstrated that a higher level of monomeric protein content can be purified from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing D-Domain-based SparX proteins compared to scFv, indicating lower levels of aggregation of the D-Domain based SparX proteins and thus greater stability. In addition, we have tested the thermal stability of D-Domains as compared to a PD-L1 binding scFv by heating them to temperatures about 100 degrees Celsius and measuring the retention of PD-L1 binding. As shown in the panels on the far right, D-Domains that were heated to the indicated temperatures retained greater PD-L1 binding as compared to the PD-L1-binding scFv, demonstrating the thermal stability of the D-Domains. 





When utilized in CARs, we believe the structural properties of the D-Domain translate into unique benefits of high transduction rates, high cell surface expression, and low tonic signaling. To modify the binding properties of the D-Domain, we can vary the amino acids on the D-Domain scaffold. In the context of ddCARs, we believe the D-Domain structure creates an efficient and scalable cell manufacturing process, as demonstrated by our high CAR+ rate, yield, and viability of cell product made to date. See “Manufacturing and Delivery—CART-ddBCMA Cell and ARC-T Cell.”
•High Transduction Rate: In the manufacturing of 38 lots of CART-ddBCMA associated with patients for which preliminary clinical data from our Phase 1 clinical trial was reported, we have achieved transduction rates ranging from approximately 48% to 87%. We believe this high transduction efficiency may improve product consistency and reduce the number of untransduced T-cells administered to patients that do not contribute to efficacy but may contribute to toxicity. Our high transduction rate compares favorably with previously published Phase 1 data regarding the transduction rates for Abecma (then known as bb2121) and Carvykti (then known as JNJ-4528), as shown in the left panel of the figure below. While we believe these data suggest that CART-ddBCMA has a meaningful advantage in transduction efficiency over existing CAR-T therapies, these data are based on a cross-trial comparison and not a head-to-head clinical trial and may not be directly comparable due to differences in trial designs and methodologies. As manufacturing processes and vectors can also be vastly different across cell products, we also engineered a vector where the D-Domain was replaced by an scFv targeting BCMA while leaving all other conditions identical to isolate the effects on transduction from using a D-Domain as compared to scFv. As shown in the right panel of the figure below, our CART-ddBCMA transduced T-cells demonstrated superior transduction efficiency when compared to scFv transduced T-cells derived from multiple normal human donors. 




•High Cell Surface Expression: Coincident with higher transduction rates, the expression of the CAR on the surface of the T cell is higher with CARs employing a D-Domain compared with an scFv. As shown in the figure below, when transduced with different CAR constructs, the CAR expression on the surface of T-cells of six normal human donors was uniformly higher using a BCMA-binding D-Domain as compared to a BCMA-binding scFv. We believe that higher CAR cell surface density may help drive activation against low antigen-expressing target cells. 
 CAR Surface Expression on T Cell



•Low Tonic Signaling: Tonic signaling occurs in CAR-T-cells when the CAR construct signals without engaging an antigen on a target cell, which can exhaust a T cell prematurely. T cell exhaustion has been associated with suboptimal outcomes for CAR-T therapies. Tonic signaling has been described in the literature for several scFv-based CARs. To determine the percentage of D-Domains that induce tonic signaling, we examined 42 D-Domains isolated from two different screening campaigns for their ability to signal without antigen stimulation when 


incorporated into a CAR construct. Pooled data indicated that only 3 out of the 42 D-Domains exhibited a level of tonic signaling above background, as measured by relative luciferase units, a signal detecting CAR activation, as represented by the blue dots in the left-hand column of the figure below. In contrast, the 42 D-Domains exhibited a much higher level of CAR activation in the presence of the CAR antigen, as illustrated by the right hand column of the figure below. We believe the low propensity for tonic signaling of D-Domain-based CARs may lower T cell exhaustion.



•Engineered D-Domain Scaffolds: The structural features of the D-Domain make it particularly well suited as a scaffold protein that can be modified by inserting selected amino acids to generate diverse libraries of proprietary target-binding domains. We create highly diverse libraries of variants of α-3D by randomly replacing 12-14 amino acid residues on the outward facing surface of α-3D with one of 18 amino acids. 
 



We screen the resulting libraries for potential target-binding domains and engineer further variants with the appropriate target binding profiles to enhance target specificity, optimize binding affinity, and remove potentially immunogenic sequences, a process we refer to as “deimmunization”. We use rigorous target selection criteria applied to genomic and proteomic datasets generated from public, collaborator, and internal sources. We internally validate expression profiles for all antigens under evaluation to select the best targets. At the same time, all the reagents needed to screen our proprietary D-Domain libraries for specific binders to the antigen are generated and qualified. Over a dozen D-Domain binders to a variety of tumor antigens have already been generated to date. We have also identified and characterized several target-binding domains for certain therapeutic targets, such as BCMA, CD123, CS1, HER2, and PD-L1. AI-based approaches are employed to assist in optimization and continue to be developed to enhance our discovery process. Applying all these discovery methods, the engineered D-Domains are incorporated into our genetically modified T-cells in our ddCAR and ARC-SparX platform.

ARC-SparX Platform
Our ARC-SparX platform is a controllable and adaptable modular therapy that builds on ddCARs by replacing the antigen binding domain of the T cell with a novel synthetic binding domain that recognizes only SparX proteins, which contain the antigen binding domain. When the SparX protein’s antigen binding domain recognizes and binds to the antigen on a diseased cell, it recruits the ARC-T cell to kill the diseased cell.



Our ARC-T-cells are designed to remain in an inactive state, or silenced, and activate only when combined with a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell. We believe that controlling ARC-T activation with SparX protein effectively separates the antigen-recognition and killing functions. By separating these functions, our approach renders the killing function of the ARC-T cell dependent on the antigen specificity and dose of the SparX protein rather than on uncontrolled CAR-T proliferation as is the case with conventional CAR-T therapy. The separation of the CAR-T from the antigen binding domain allows for a more controlled, modular approach to CAR-T therapy, as SparX dosing can be modified over the course of treatment, multiple SparX proteins may be incorporated, and additional functionality (i.e., logic-gating) may be designed to expand the utility of CAR-T therapy. Further, the approach may simplify the manufacturing of multiple CAR-T programs and the regulatory path, as the ARC-T programs can utilize the same vector to express binding domain. We also believe unregulated killing, which induces severe toxicities, may be mitigated with our approach by adjusting the dose and schedule of SparX protein administration, which may expand the antigens that can be targeted safely with CAR-T therapy. Additionally, stopping the dose of the SparX protein periodically can allow the ARC-T-cells to rest after activation lowering the risk of T-cell exhaustion, which is a common cause of rapid decline of genetically modified T-cells.
 Soluble Protein Antigen Receptor X-linkers (SparX protein)
All SparX proteins are comprised of one or more antigen-specific binding domains from our D-Domain library, fused to a protein that we refer to as the “TAG”. We believe the TAG we use in our SparX proteins offers unique properties that confer a competitive advantage for our program. The TAG is a protein designed to be recognized by our ARC-T-cells, which have a D-Domain-based binding moiety that is specific to the TAG, which we call the anti-TAG. This TAG/anti-TAG design is critical to the universality of our ARC-T-cells as it allows such cells to bind any SparX protein, because each SparX protein contains the same TAG. As SparX proteins bind their target antigen on diseased cells, they display the TAG thereby “tagging” such cell as one that should be killed by an ARC-T cell.

The TAG we have built into our SparX proteins is a ~26 kDa C-terminal fragment of human alpha fetoprotein (hAFP). We selected and engineered the TAG for our SparX proteins for the following reasons:
•Humans have a pre-established tolerance to hAFP from experiencing high levels in utero and as pregnant mothers. We believe that creating our TAG from a normal human protein will reduce the likelihood of immunogenicity of the TAG and by extension, the SparX protein containing the TAG. 
 •We believe the small size of the SparX protein will allow it to penetrate complex tumor microenvironments with a half-life short enough (estimated to be several hours in humans) that physicians could manage an emerging toxicity by withholding or decreasing the next SparX protein dose thereby causing the ARC-T-cells to deactivate. Such control is not possible with most mAb-based adapters due to their half-life of several weeks. 
 •The TAG can also be readily fused to multiple binding regions, enabling SparX proteins to be multi-valent or multi-specific. 
 Because the antigen-specific binding domains on the SparX protein differ by only 12-14 amino acids on the outer faces of the scaffold, the manufacturing process for each SparX protein is substantially similar regardless of specificity. SparX proteins can be readily produced in microbial, yeast and mammalian expression systems, and development is underway on subcutaneous formulations. We also expect the pharmacokinetics of all SparX proteins to be similar and believe that we can leverage the learnings from clinical trials of one SparX protein to inform the design of later trials for other SparX proteins.
Antigen Receptor Complex (ARC)
The ARC is similar to CARs in that both are engineered chimeric transmembrane receptors, where the engagement of the extracellular antigen binding domain induces activation of the intracellular domain resulting in the T cell’s proliferative and cytolytic activity. However, in lieu of the scFv extracellular binding domain of conventional CAR-T therapies, the extracellular domain of the ARC is comprised of our proprietary binding D-Domain that is designed to exclusively bind the TAG and not hAFP or any other known proteins or antigens. Thus, the ARC-T remains in an inactive state, or silenced, in the absence of our proprietary SparX protein. The ARC signals through a similar mechanism as traditional second-generation CARs since they share the same intracellular signaling regions of 4-1BB and CD3-zeta with the only difference arising from when the T-cells are activated.
Additionally, because all ARC-T-cells are intended to express a TAG-specific binding domain rather than a cell surface antigen-specific binding domain, the manufacturing of ARC-T is more scalable than in conventional CAR-T therapies in that ARC-T’s comprise the same drug product irrespective of clinical indication or target antigen. The same lentiviral vector comprising the universal ARC and a similar T-cell transduction process can be used for every patient regardless of disease or target antigen. With conventional CAR-T therapy, different viral vectors, each with a different T-cell transduction process, need to be used to make new CAR-T-cells when physicians want to target a new antigen. This represents a potentially significant manufacturing and regulatory advantage. In the longer term, engineering an allogeneic ARC-T cell presents the opportunity for a truly universal cell therapy that could be manufactured to be an “off-the-shelf” option that physicians can use regardless of disease or target antigen. Moreover, ARC-T-cells could be redirected to kill cells expressing different antigens just by changing the SparX protein. This universal nature of the ARC-T cell could provide substantial flexibility to the physician and allow for dynamic treatments that can respond quickly to the changing profile of a disease such as cancer, unlike a conventional CAR-T therapy.
Benefits of the ARC-SparX Platform
We believe the key benefits to our ARC-SparX platform are driven by the controllable and adaptable characteristics and present an opportunity in indications where toxicities, heterogeneity, or on-target off-tumor effects represent a challenge:
 Dose Regulation of SparX Protein. Our ARC-T-cells are activated only when combined with a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell. Our ARC-T-cells bind the SparX protein, but do not bind directly to the diseased cell. The SparX protein is designed to recognize and bind one or more specific antigens on the diseased cells and then flag such cells for destruction. Once the triple complex of ARC-T cell plus SparX protein plus antigen-expressing cell is formed, the ARC-T cell is activated to kill the antigen-expressing cell. The ARC-T cell remains in an inactive state, or silenced, in the absence of our proprietary SparX proteins. The dosability of our ARC-SparX platform potentially provides a new way for physicians to manage or prevent severe T cell-associated toxicities, while maintaining the objective to maximize efficacy. Additionally, intermittent dosing of SparX protein may allow ARC-T-cells to rest between doses, which may lower the risk of T-cell exhaustion.


We have conducted preclinical studies in which we have observed the ability of SparX proteins to control the killing function of ARC-T-cells in a dose-dependent manner, as exemplified in the figure below. In this study, mice were given a BCMA-expressing tumor, followed several days later by the administration of a constant number of ARC-T-cells. In the first group of five mice (left), a high dose (3 mg/kg) of a SparX protein that could not bind the tumor was injected daily (Control). Because the Control SparX could not bind the tumor, the tumor grew as evidenced by the intense blue, green and red colors. The second, third and fourth groups (left to right) of mice received a high (3 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) or low (0.03 mg/kg) dose, respectively, of a mono-valent BCMA-binding SparX protein. The low dose had little to no impact on tumor growth, the medium dose had immediate anti-tumor activity when compared to the Control, and the high dose cleared the tumor as shown by the complete absence of color, indicating that SparX protein targeting a tumor can modulate the extent of tumor killing in vivo.
Tumor Killing is Dose Dependent



Adaptability of Treatment Regimen. Because ARC-T-cells are not antigen-specific, they can be adapted to changing disease conditions by the administration of additional SparX proteins with different target specificity. Due to tumor heterogeneity and downregulation or loss of the target antigen, relapsed or refractory disease remains a significant issue for CAR-T therapy. On our ARC-SparX platform, physicians can administer different SparX proteins to redirect the same ARC-T-cells to new antigens. This is particularly important in settings where tumors may be heterogeneous or downregulate expression of the antigen(s) targeted by the initial SparX proteins. We believe that our ARC-SparX platform can address refractory disease caused by tumor heterogeneity because the same ARC-T-cells can be redirected in vivo to target different antigens through the administration of different SparX proteins for personalized therapy tailored to the molecular profile for each patient’s disease. This will be particularly important as we move beyond B cell malignancies into indications like AML/MDS or solid tumors.
 Our preclinical studies support the ability of ARC-T-cells to kill heterogeneous tumors through sequential administration of SparX proteins with different target specificity. We used an in vivo model in which NSG mice were injected with NALM-6-GFP/Luc expressing either BCMA (97%) or CD123 (3%). We chose this approach as it mimics the antigen heterogeneity often observed in many patient’s tumors. With only 3% of the tumor cells positive for CD123, daily dosing with SparX B had little effect on tumor growth compared to mice which received a non-binding control SparX. In contrast, SparX A had significant anti-tumor activity by day 7 following ARC-T and SparX administration, but tumors rapidly regrew. As shown in the figure below, the tumor cells that regrew were characterized to be completely CD123 positive. However, all the measurable tumor cells could be eliminated by redirecting ARC-T-cells through sequential administration of SparX A followed by SparX B. Taken together, these data support the ability of ARC-T-cells to be redirected in vivo to kill heterogenous tumors that are refractory to single antigen targeting.

Custom Logic-Gated Therapeutics to Enable Selectivity and Improve Targeting. The unique properties of D-Domains, and our ability to engineer them, allow us to create mono-valent, multi-valent, or multi-specific SparX to optimize antigen binding affinity and improve efficacy. Bi-specific SparX proteins can be designed as an ‘OR’ gate to target two different antigens for broader tumor cell recognition when faced with antigen heterogeneity or an ‘AND’ gate to more specifically identify diseased cells that uniquely co-express two antigens but spare healthy cells that express only one antigen. Through affinity engineering and controlled dosing, the AND-gated bispecific SparX proteins can drive greater specificity for dual-antigen expressing tumor cells over single antigen expressing normal cells to avoid the typical on-target off-tumor related toxicities observed with so many conventional CAR-T products targeting solid tumor antigens.

AND-gated Bi-specific targeting



Streamlined Manufacturing Across All Programs. ARC-T-cells are genetically modified to express the same anti-TAG binding receptor to be used in every patient, regardless of disease or the target-specificity of the SparX protein. We believe this feature may enable use of the same lentiviral vector and similar cell processing, resulting in a scalable manufacturing process that is applicable to every patient across all programs. We have also established manufacturing processes for SparX proteins utilizing a cost-effective microbial-based expression system and purification process. Because each SparX protein is substantially similar regardless of specificity, the manufacturing and purification processes for each SparX protein is substantially similar regardless of specificity. For more details, see “—Manufacturing and Delivery.”
 Efficient Regulatory Process. Because the ARC-T cell manufacturing process is identical across all ARC-SparX programs, the regulatory requirements will be shared across the platform. This has distinct advantages that will span global regulatory filings from IND through post BLA requirements.

Our Pipeline Approach
We are leveraging the full breadth of our platform by matching ddCARs and ARC-SparX with the indications in which they would be most effective based on the biology, patients, and market dynamics.
In MM, we plan to:
•Evaluate the efficacy of our lead product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, in our iMMagine-1 Phase 2 pivotal trial in rrMM and seek regulatory approval in collaboration with Kite; 
 •In collaboration with Kite, pursue expanded access to CART-ddBCMA through label expansion clinical trials; 
 •Through our ex-U.S. partner, Kite, pursue clinical development of CART-ddBCMA in other key geographies, such as Europe and Asia; and 
 •Evaluate the potential of our ARC-SparX technology through our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ACLX-001 in rrMM. 


In AML/MDS, we plan to:
•Pursue AML/MDS with a library of SparX proteins beginning with ACLX-002, which is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial; and 
 •Explore trials that evaluate the use of a single administration of ARC-T-cells together with a combination of SparX proteins engineered to target different AML and MDS antigens, to extend the power of the platform. 
 In additional indications, including solid tumors, we plan to:
•Extend benefits of our D-Domain platform by applying ddCARs and ARC-SparXs to new indications, including SCLC and HCC. 
 Our Pipeline
We have built a broad and scalable pipeline that has positioned us to capitalize on the potential of our proprietary platform technologies and achieve long-term growth and sustainability within the field of cell therapy. We have summarized our preclinical and clinical programs in the pipeline chart below and indicated where such programs are subject to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, which is described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below. Except for such partnered programs, we have worldwide rights to all of our programs:


* Kite retains an option for select ARC-SparX programs in multiple myeloma
 
Our Multiple Myeloma Program
Our MM program is led by our CART-ddBCMA product candidate, which is an autologous cell therapy comprised of D-Domain powered T-cells that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill specific cells expressing BCMA, a target antigen for multiple myeloma. In collaboration with Kite, we are advancing our CART-ddBCMA product through our iMMagine-1 Phase 2 pivotal trial in patients with rrMM, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and thereafter plan to pursue U.S. regulatory approval. CART-ddBCMA has been granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug by the FDA. In May 2021, we also received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for CART-ddBCMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Following completion of enrollment for our iMMagine-1 Phase 2 pivotal trial, in collaboration with Kite, we plan to continue to enroll more patients into additional clinical trials, to support label expansion to enter into earlier lines of therapy and include patients who have had prior BCMA-targeted. Additionally, pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations”

below, Kite will pursue international clinical trials to expand into geographic locations in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We are also advancing our initial ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, an immunotherapeutic combination composed of ARC-T-cells and bi-valent SparX proteins targeting BCMA, to treat rrMM. This program is designed to lay the foundation for our ARC-SparX platform.
Market Opportunity
MM is a type of hematological cancer in which diseased plasma cells proliferate and accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out healthy blood cells and causing bone lesions, loss of bone density and bone fractures. These abnormal plasma cells also produce excessive quantities of an abnormal immunoglobulin fragment called a myeloma protein (M protein) causing kidney damage and impairing the patient’s immune function.
MM is the third most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe, representing approximately 10% of all hematological cancer cases, 20% of deaths due to hematological malignancies and impacting over 100,000 patients globally each year. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database projects that approximately 35,000 new cases of MM in the United States and over 35,000 new cases in six select markets within Europe and Asia.
The median age of MM patients at diagnosis is 69 years with one-third of patients diagnosed at an age of at least 75 years. Because MM tends to afflict patients at an advanced stage of life, patients often have multiple co-morbidities and toxicities that can quickly escalate and become life-endangering. Despite the development and use of multiple new therapies, including second generation proteasome inhibitors (PI) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD), stem cell transplantation and CD38-binding monoclonal antibodies, the five-year survival rate is still approximately 50% and MM remains incurable in most patients.
Most patients eventually relapse after treatment, and those who relapse following treatment with second generation PIs and IMiDs have a median event-free-survival of only 5 months and median overall survival of only 9 months. The outcomes of patients following treatment with CD38-binding antibodies are also poor with response rates of approximately 30%, median progression-free-survival (mPFS) of 3.4 months and median overall survival of 9 months.
Currently, multiple BCMA-targeting therapies are in development or under regulatory review, including T cell engagers (TCEs), antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and CAR-T therapies. Along similar lines, TCEs and CAR-T therapies targeting CD19 and BCMA have been developed and approved for the treatment of certain CD19 and BCMA positive hematological malignancies.
In 2021, the size of the global MM market was approximately $20 billion. We estimate the current total addressable CAR-T market for rrMM to be $12 billion or more based on the number of patients who are receiving second line treatments and beyond.
As of March 29, 2023, the two CAR-T therapies targeting BCMA that have been approved by the FDA are Abecma and Carvykti. Two-Seventy/Bristol Myers Squibb and Legend/Johnson & Johnson are currently enrolling clinical trials targeting the expansion of Abecma and Carvykti, respectively, into earlier lines of multiple myeloma treatment, as both are currently approved only as a fifth line of therapy. Carvykti, developed by Legend/Johnson & Johnson, has demonstrated a sCR rate of 78.4% and mPFS that will exceed 20 months. In October, 2022, the BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody, Tecvayli developed by Johnson & Johnson, received accelerated approval for treatment of adults with rrMM as a fifth line of therapy. Tecvayli has reported an ORR of 61.8% and a CR rate of 28.2%, with a mPFS that is likely to exceed 9 months. However, Tecvayli is dosed weekly, administered under a REMS program and requires hospitalization through the initial titration period. Although approved BCMA-targeting therapies represent a step forward, there remains a need for improved overall response, durability, safety, and accessibility. For example, across the clinical trials of Abecma and Carvykti, the presence of EMD has been a poor prognostic factor. In these clinical trials, patients with EMD have had lower CR rate, shorter DOR, and shorter PFS rates. In the Phase 1 trial of Carvykti (LEGEND-2), for instance, the CR rate was approximately 60% in patients with EMD (compared with approximately 80% in non-EMD patients) and mPFS was 8.1 months for patients with EMD (versus approximately 25 months in non-EMD patients). The BCMA-targeting ADC, Blenrep was an approved product, but the manufacturer, GSK, began the withdrawal of the U.S. marketing authorization in November 2022, at the request of the FDA.
 CART-ddBCMA: Phase 1 Trial Preliminary Results
The CART-ddBCMA Phase 1 multi-center, open label, trial is the first involving one of our proprietary D-Domains and was designed to test CART-ddBCMA in rrMM patients to evaluate the safety profile of escalating dose levels (DL) and to expand enrollment at a selected dose to further characterize the efficacy and safety profile of that dose. To be eligible, patients must have had at least 3 prior lines of treatment, which had to include an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), a proteosome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 antibody, be refractory to the most recent line of therapy, have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, have measurable disease, and have adequate function of vital organs. If eligible, patients were enrolled, underwent leukapheresis (apheresis), and could receive

bridging therapy while cell manufacturing occurred. When CART-ddBCMA cell manufacturing was complete, patients received lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy with fludarabine (Flu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) on days -5, -4, and -3. On day 0, patients received an intravenous infusion of CART-ddBCMA. After infusion, patients were evaluated at fixed intervals for assessment of AEs and evidence of objective response using PET/CT scan, serum measurement of M-protein (including heavy or light chain measurement), and measurement of number of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. Safety data are assessed for dose limiting toxicity in the first 28 days following infusion and will be collected throughout the trial. Long-term safety data will be collected for up to 15 years per health authority guidelines. Efficacy data are assessed pursuant to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria on a monthly basis for the first 6 months and then quarterly for up to two years, or upon symptomatic relapse.



The IMWG uniform response criteria have been utilized in registration trials of approved myeloma drugs. The IMWG uniform response criteria assess efficacy of treatment options for myeloma and allow for a comparison of efficacy between treatment strategies in clinical trials, strict definitions for responses, as shown in the table below, and classifications to improve detail and clarify inconsistent interpretations across clinical trials. The IMWG criteria for sCR, CR, VGPR, and PR are summarized below.
•stringent Complete Response (sCR): Complete Response (as defined below) plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow biopsy by immunohistochemistry (kappa to lambda light chain ratio (k/l) ≤4:1 or ≥1:2 for k or l patients, respectively, after counting ≥100 plasma cells). 
 •Complete Response (CR): Negative immunofixation in the serum and urine; and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas; and <5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. 
 •Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Serum and urine M protein, detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis; or ≥90% reduction in serum M protein plus urine M protein level <100 mg/24 hr. 
 •Partial Response (PR): ≥50% reduction of serum M protein plus reduction in 24-hour urinary M protein by ≥90% or to <200 mg/24 h; or if the serum and urine M protein are unmeasurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M protein criteria and if serum-free light assay is also unmeasurable, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M protein, provided baseline BMPC percentage was ≥30%. In addition to these criteria, if present at baseline, a ≥50% reduction in the size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required. 
 Overall Response Rate (ORR) includes patients that achieved sCR, CR, VGPR or PR. sCR and CR do not indicate that the patient was cured of the condition, as the disease is currently incurable.
The clinical trial began enrollment in December 2019 and the first patient was dosed in February 2020. Four clinical trial sites participated in the Phase 1 trial.. We have completed the dose escalation component with 6 patients each enrolled in DL1 (100 (+/-20%) x 106 cells) and DL2 (300 (+/- 20%) x 106 cells). The preliminary data from the dose escalation were most recently presented at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH). Based on the nearly identical ORR in each DL and the observed potential for increased toxicity in DL2, we enrolled additional patients (n=26) at DL1 for further characterization of safety and preliminary efficacy. As of the data cut-off date of October 31, 2022, we have enrolled and dosed an aggregate of 38 patients,
24


including 32 at DL1. In the safety and efficacy analysis, 38 patients were evaluable, 32 in the RP2D (115 (+/- 10) x 106 CAR+ cells) and 6 in DL2 (300 (+/- 20%) x 106 CAR+ cells).



The median age of enrolled patients was 66 years (range 44-76). Twenty-three (61%) patients were male and 15 were female (39%). Bone marrow replacement of ≥60% with malignant plasma cells was present in 9 (38%) of patients, 5 patients (13%) had ISS Stage III (i.e., B2M ≥5.5) disease, and 13 (34%) had EMD. Combining these three attributes into a collective term of “high risk prognostic features,” 22 (58%) of all patients had at least 1 of these features. All 38 subjects were evaluable for cytogenetic evaluation, and 11 (29%) had high-risk cytogenetics (defined as Del 17p, t(14;16), or t(4;14). The median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (range 3-16). All patients (38; 100%) had triple class refractory disease and 26 (68%) had penta-refractory disease. Taken together, these demographic data indicate the patient population enrolled in this trial had poor prognosis with expected median overall survival in the range of 6-8 months based on published analyses of patients with similar characteristics.

The ORR was 100%, the CR/sCR rate was 71%, the VGPR rate was 18%, and the PR rate was 11%. Notably, the likelihood of achieving CR/sCR increased with longer follow-up as indicated by the proportion of patients achieving CR/sCR who were dosed at least 18 months ago (81% CR/sCR rate) versus those dosed at least 1 month ago (71% CR/sCR rate). This observation is consistent with other rrMM studies, especially in BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell trials.

As of the October 31, 2022 data cutoff date, a Kaplan-Meier analysis of all subjects demonstrated a PFS rate at 6, 12, and 18 months of 92%, 73%, and 65%, respectively. A subgroup analysis of subjects with high risk clinical features (defined as presence of EMD, BMPC ≥ 60%, or B2M ≥ 5.5) indicated similar PFS rates at 6, 12, and 18 months of 91%, 69%, and 63%, respectively. Across all subgroups analyzed, the PFS rate at 18 months was no lower than 63%.

 MRD abbreviations: NE = not evaluable, failed calibration; POS = positive; Pending = sample being analyzed
In the United States, it is estimated that up to 20% of the rrMM population has EMD. Patients with EMD in clinical trials of other BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies have been reported to experience worse outcomes, including lower ORR, lower CR rates, shorter mPFS, and shorter mDOR, than non-EMD patients. In our Phase 1 trial, 34% of all enrolled patients had EMD. We believe the preliminary results for patients with EMD treated with CART-ddBCMA show a potential for CART-ddBCMA to be a best-in-class treatment for rrMM for patients with EMD. Previous clinical trial data using CAR-T cell therapy hematologic malignancies have indicated that patients with high tumor burden tend to have greater risk of high grade adverse events (like CRS and/or ICANS) as well as lower rates of deep response and shorter mPFS. In our Phase 1 trial, 22 (58%) patients had one of these high-risk features (EMD, ISS Stage 3, or BMPC ≥ 60%). Based on the demographic features of the Phase 1 trial, we believe it is possible that in future trials, enrolling a population with fewer poor prognostic features may yield improved PFS rates and a comparable safety profile.
Of the 38 patients dosed, all (100%) were evaluable for safety analysis. The rate of AEs of grade 3 or higher CRS and ICANS are of special interest (AESIs). A potential difference was observed in the incidence of AESIs in DL2 compared with DL1. Specifically, in DL2 (n=6), 1 patient had a grade 3 CRS event and another had a grade 3 ICANS event, while no events of grade 3 or higher CRS or ICANS occurred in the 6-patient dose escalation cohort of DL1. After dose expansion at the RP2D, no events of grade 3 or higher CRS were observed in a total of 32 subjects. and only 1 (3%) out of 32 patients had a grade 3 ICANS event. In combined analysis of all patients in DL1, 30 (94%) had a grade 1 or 2 CRS event but 0% had grade 3 or higher CRS. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 (range 1-12) days and median duration was 8 (range 2-14) days. The median time to ICANS onset was 4.5 days (range 3-6 days) with a median duration of 7.5 days (4-11 days). All cases of ICANS and CRS resolved with standard interventions, such as tocilizumab and dexamethasone. We are continuing to perform analyses to determine whether any patients may be treated as an outpatient. Additional AEs, regardless of attribution, were presented at the ASH 2022 Annual Meeting and are presented in the figures below. The observed AEs are consistent with those of other autologous CAR-T-cells in clinical trials and in commercial use.






*Infusion Day 0 is considered Study Day 1


We intend to provide further updates on the results of the ongoing Phase 1 trial in 2023.
CART-ddBCMA: Phase 2 Pivotal Trial in rrMM (iMMagine-1)
 Our Phase 2 pivotal trial of CART-ddBCMA in rrMM, the iMMagine-1 trial was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022. The trial is a single-arm, open-label, evaluation of the efficacy of CART-ddBCMA, as measured by the primary endpoint of ORR. Key secondary endpoints include sCR/CR rate and duration of response of a single infusion of CART-ddBCMA after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was selected based on historical precedent of the primary endpoint used in other CAR-T pivotal trials and the selection of this primary endpoint has been reviewed and agreed with the FDA. Based upon feedback from regulatory authorities, we plan to include a total of approximately 110 patients in the pivotal trial, which will be the primary analysis used for review for consideration of approval. To be eligible, patients must have had at least 3 prior lines of treatment, which had to include an IMiD, PI and an anti-CD38 antibody, be refractory to the most recent line of therapy, have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, have measurable disease, and have adequate function of vital organs. We expect a median follow-up requirement of approximately 13 months. This trial will be conducted at institutions in the United States only. Other secondary and/or exploratory endpoints will include progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), assessment of minimal residual disease, further characterization of the safety profile of CART-ddBCMA in a larger patient population, and confirmatory correlative biomarker analysis for pharmacology, predictive biomarkers of depth and duration of response, and manufactured CART-ddBCMA cell phenotyping. Assuming positive data from this clinical trial, we plan to file a BLA in 2025 in collaboration with Kite.


CART-ddBCMA: Phase 3 Trial in Earlier Lines of Therapy in MM (iMMagine-2)
Ultimately, we believe the use of CART-ddBCMA will move to earlier lines of therapy in MM. Therefore, following completing enrollment of the iMMagine-1 trial, in collaboration with Kite, we plan to initiate enrollment of a Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate efficacy of CART-ddBCMA in additional populations, which we refer to as the iMMagine-2 trial. Similar to other CAR-T therapies targeting BCMA, we plan to focus on enrollment of patients in earlier lines of therapy. We will seek to demonstrate in the iMMagine-2 trial that CART-ddBCMA can provide clinical benefit in patients in earlier line populations.

CART-ddBCMA: Future Clinical Plans
Pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, Kite will initiate clinical trials of CART-ddBCMA in additional key geographies, such as Europe and Asia, which may also serve to further expand the label into additional populations in the United States.
 ACLX-001 (BCMA): Phase 1 Trial
Our first ARC-SparX program is ACLX-001, an immunotherapeutic combination composed of ARC-T-cells and bi-valent SparX proteins targeting BCMA, or SPRX001, for the treatment of rrMM. In ACLX-001, we use our ARC-T-cells for the first time in combination with SPRX001, which utilizes the same antigen binding domain as CART-ddBCMA. We initiated our Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial of ACLX-001 in the second quarter of 2022. This trial is intended to serve as clinical validation of our ARC-SparX platform as we seek to understand PK, safety profile, and dosing strategy for future clinical development. The clinical trial is designed to allow dose escalation and flexibility in the frequency of SPRX001 administration based on observed pharmacokinetics of SPRX001 and ARC-T cell expansion kinetics. We intend to present interim clinical data of the Phase 1 trial of ACLX-001 in 2023.
The primary objective of the trial is to provide clinical validation of our ARC-SparX platform as we seek to understand PK, safety profile, and dosing strategy for future clinical development programs. We intend to also demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with rrMM that can support the potential of ACLX-001 and the ARC-SparX platform. The primary endpoint of the trial is to determine the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Upon completion of the Phase 1 trial, we will leverage the learnings from this trial to advance our AML/MDS programs utilizing ARC-SparX and consider developing additional SparX for rrMM for a broader pipeline in this disease area.
Our AML/MDS Programs
With the ARC-SparX platform we are developing a comprehensive solution for personalized therapy tailored to the molecular profile of an AML/MDS patient’s disease.
Diseased cells from AML and high risk MDS patients often have a complex cytogenetic profile that leads to significant clonal heterogeneity. This heterogeneity exists not only between patients but also within an individual’s disease. Traditional targeted therapies including CAR-Ts have struggled to drive deep and durable responses because they target only a fraction of the patient’s diseased cells. In addition, traditional CAR-T targets in AML/MDS such as CD33, CD123 and CLL1 are expressed on normal myeloid cells, including progenitor cell populations, which may lead to prolonged myelosuppression.
We intend to utilize SparX proteins targeting different AML and MDS antigens that can be used in combination to combat disease heterogeneity. Furthermore, we believe the controllability of the ARC-SparX platform will give physicians the ability to turn off the therapy once disease is controlled to allow for faster recovery of the normal myeloid compartment and thus less toxicity. We initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial for ACLX-002, our lead ARC-SparX program for AML/MDS in the fourth quarter of 2022 and continue to develop preclinical SparX proteins for other AML/MDS antigens.
 Background, Current Treatments and Limitations
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), also referred to as acute myelogenous leukemia, arises from healthy bone marrow stem cells that have accumulated multiple genetic mutations causing the mutated stem cells to grow uncontrollably. The aggressive growth of AML cells in the bone marrow disrupts the development of healthy blood cells including white cells, red cells and platelets. The net result is that AML patients often present with anemia (too few red blood cells), infections (caused by too few functioning white blood cells) or frequent bleeding and bruising (caused by too few platelets). The aggressive growth of AML in the bone marrow and blood, its disruption of normal blood cell production and the lack of durable treatments leave AML patients with a 28.7% five-year survival rate.
According to the National Cancer Institute SEER database, there were estimated to be 64,512 people living with AML in the USA in 2017. In 2020, new cases were estimated to have been approximately 19,940, with 11,180 deaths. The disease accounts for approximately 1.1% of all new cancers, but is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults. AML also represents approximately 20% of childhood leukemia.
The standard of care for the majority of AML patients consists of induction chemotherapy (cytarabine and anthracycline) followed by additional rounds of chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplant. Although approximately two-thirds of patients achieve remission, relapse often occurs within the first 18 months following treatment. The high relapse rate points to the need for

new therapies capable of extending disease free survival. We believe there is a critical need to develop new therapeutic modalities with greater safety and efficacy, especially for patients with relapsed or refractory AML.
Currently, new therapies for AML have many limitations. The lead candidates of small molecule inhibitors of proteins that are over-expressed or otherwise dysregulated in AML show only modest efficacy with short duration of response. Antibody-based therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates and bispecifics, have thus far shown limited efficacy and in some cases, significant toxicities. Additionally, CAR-T therapy is being deployed with specificity for various targets including CD33, CD123, FLT3, CLL1, CD19, IL1RAP and NKG2DL. Many of these therapies are in the early stages of clinical development. The common theme across the various therapeutic modalities described above is the need for new therapies with enhanced efficacy and improved safety.
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a closely related disease in which a population of abnormal myeloid stem cells develop in the bone marrow. Depending on the type of abnormal, or dysplastic cell that emerges, patients may experience a specific decrease in red blood cells, or one of the disease-fighting cell populations referred to as monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. Like AML, MDS impacts the elderly with patients often diagnosed in their 70s. The incidence of MDS has been estimated to be as low as 10,000 new cases per year in the United States. MDS is considered to be a type of cancer because about one-third of MDS patients progress to AML. Standard therapy for MDS is cytarabine alone or in combination with idarubicin or daunorubicin. Stem cell transplant can cure MDS but the advanced age of onset and co-morbidities often limit MDS patient transplant eligibility due to the toxicity of typical transplant conditioning regimens, especially for those patients characterized with high risk MDS. Thus, new therapies are needed for MDS patients as well.
ACLX-002 (CD123): Phase 1 Trial
 Our first AML/MDS product candidate is ACLX-002, which is an immunotherapeutic combination agent composed of the same ARC-T-cells used in ACLX-001, together with mono-valent SparX proteins that each contain a binding domain directed at CD123. We began clinical development of ACLX-002 in the fourth quarter of 2022 with initiation of a Phase 1, dose escalation trial of both ARC-T-cells and SPRX002 in relapsed or refractory AML and/or high-risk MDS. The primary objective of the trial is to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) that does not exceed the MTD and achieves evidence of clear clinical benefit. The primary endpoint of the trial will be to determine the incidence of TEAEs, including DLTs. The clinical trial is designed to allow dose escalation and flexibility in the frequency of SPRX002 administration based on observed pharmacokinetics of SPRX002 and ARC-T cell expansion kinetics.
 Preclinical AML/MDS Product Candidates
We have also identified a group of high priority antigen targets associated with AML/MDS through internal analyses and conversations with key opinion leaders and are developing additional SparX proteins against such target antigens. We have isolated D-Domain binders to several of these high value AML/MDS targets and plan to progress them in our pipeline. In several of our preclinical and discovery projects, we have engineered D-Domains into SparX proteins that bind to these targets, including for ACLX-003, which continues to progress toward IND-enabling studies. Additionally, we are building a map of target expression in primary AML patient tumors to understand how our targets may eventually be combined to combat the inherent heterogeneity of the disease.
Our Solid Tumor Program
 We intend to develop multiple assets and novel technology to combat a variety of solid tumor indications while leveraging the strengths of each of our existing therapeutic platforms.
ddCARs may be best suited for targets that have highly homogeneous tumor cell expression with little to no normal cell expression with potential for a wide therapeutic window. We are continuing to build ddCARs where the target biology supports this approach. To this end, we have selected D-Domain binders to an attractive target that we are evaluating as a ddCAR to potentially treat patients with HCC.
 Some solid tumors have been shown to contain a high level of heterogeneity within an individual’s tumor. Where this heterogeneity exists, we believe a library of SparX proteins targeting a specific solid tumor patient population has the potential to drive deep and durable responses beyond those produced by any single targeting therapeutic. We currently have engineered novel SparX proteins for various solid tumor-associated antigens, some with overlapping expression in specific patient populations such as SCLC, that together may allow ARC-SparX product candidates to overcome antigen heterogeneity of the disease.
Targeting solid tumors with cellular therapy presents additional hurdles such as on-target off-tumor toxicity as well as physical and immunological barriers. We intend to use a multi-pronged approach employing innovative technological solutions such

as AND-gated SparX proteins as well as technologies designed to enhance the persistence and function of ddCAR or ARC-T-cells in the tumor environment. We also intend to employ clinical and translational strategies such as combinations with checkpoint inhibitors to boost activity of ddCAR or ARC-T-cells to further overcome some common immunological barriers to successful CAR-T therapy.
Additional Indications and Applications of Our Technology
We believe our platform technologies lend themselves to a broad array of potential applications, including:
Novel Targets. We believe our platforms are well suited to safely and rapidly explore targeting of novel antigens that would be otherwise challenging to target with a conventional CAR-Ts. We have successfully generated D-Domain binders to over a dozen tumor antigens and are employing sophisticated tools, such as AI and ML, to optimize these assets. We employ AI-based approaches to assist in the optimization of D-Domain properties and continue to develop AI-based approaches to enhance our discovery process. We currently use an in-silico immunogenicity risk assessment and deimmunization platform using an ML algorithm for predicting potential immunogenic epitopes. We also use AI-based protein structure determination programs to analyze the surface chemistry of our D-Domains to better determine aspects such as library design and hit optimization. We believe further implementation of AI and ML can assist in other areas of the discovery process such as D-Domain affinity optimization from deep learning of analysis of thousands of D-Domain sequences from our panning and screening campaigns.
Next-Generation Cell Therapy Products, such as Allogeneic and Other Immune Cell Therapies. We believe it will be important for patients to have both autologous and allogeneic/off-the-shelf cell therapy options as both therapeutic options mature, including therapies derived from T-cells and NK cells. Under the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, Kite will develop allogeneic/off-the-shelf cell therapies for the treatment of myeloma as another tool in our fight against cancer that includes our autologous ddCARs and ARC-SparX.
 Indications Beyond Oncology. As the field of adoptive cell therapy looks to apply the technology beyond oncology, including transplantation, autoimmune, cardiac, infectious and neurological diseases, so too do we seek to explore such opportunities. We envision expanding into treatments for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as refractory systemic lupus erythematosus, refractory primary Sjogren’s syndrome, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. For example, published scientific studies have shown that clearance of plasma cells within patients that have antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases have resulted in improvement in clinical symptoms. We can test CART-ddBCMA or ACLX-001 in these settings to eliminate normal plasma cells for patients with these severe autoimmune diseases.
 Diagnostics. Our D-Domains or SparX proteins may be used in various diagnostic settings much like monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments. As an example, we can envision labeling SparX proteins with a radiotracer for imaging tumors in patients as a patient selection tool prior to starting therapy with that same SparX together with ARC-T-cells.
Antibody Alternatives. Our binding domains have many positive attributes over scFv binding domains that we believe could allow them to be used as an scFv alternative in non-cell therapy applications and serve as the foundation to creating a new class of therapeutic antibody alternatives.
Manufacturing and Delivery
Our manufacturing process is consistent across CART-ddBCMA cells and ARC-T-cells. This consistent process enables flexibility of cell product production within a site using the same equipment and consistent protocols, utilizing product specific viral vector input. As we advance clinical development of multiple product candidates across our ddCAR and ARC-SparX platforms, we have secured key components, including lentiviral vector, and capacity from our manufacturing partners to ensure we are able to complete enrollment for our CART-ddBCMA Phase 2 pivotal trial and our Phase 1 trial of ACLX-001. Pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, following the completion of technical transfer of our cell manufacturing process to Kite, Kite will be responsible for manufacturing activities for future clinical trials and commercial supply of CART-ddBCMA.
CART-ddBCMA Cell and ARC-T Cell
 We currently rely on third parties for the manufacture and release testing of viral vectors and product candidates for clinical testing. We also currently rely on third parties for patient apheresis material logistics, as well as to package, label, store and distribute our product candidates. As we progress through development to commercialization, we will leverage our best-in-class vendors and collaboration with Kite, and evaluate other options as needed, to secure commercial-scale capacity.

Our cell manufacturing supplier for the CART-ddBCMA Phase 1 trial has proven to be a reliable partner, releasing 100% of initiated cell product runs through November 22, 2022. Of the 38 lots of CART-ddBCMA associated with patients for which preliminary clinical data from our Phase 1 clinical trial was reported, cell product for CART-ddBCMA has thus far had a mean viability of 98%, a mean percent CAR+ rate of 69%, and a mean yield of over one billion cells, more than sufficient for our intended therapeutic dose of 115 (+/- 10) million cells.
In 2022, we completed the technology transfer activities and submitted IND amendments for the manufacturing of CART-ddBCMA to our suppliers for our pivotal iMMagine-1 Phase 2 trial, Oxford Biomedica for the supply of lentiviral vector, and Lonza Houston, Inc. for the manufacturing of our cell product. We dosed our first patients in the iMMagine-1 trial with pivotal trial drug product using these third-party suppliers in the fourth quarter of 2022.
We are continuing to invest in process improvements to reduce the overall process time and improve costs. Our D-Domain, due to its stability, has demonstrated a high transduction rate resulting in a more efficient manufacturing process. We believe this will translate to improved processes that will reduce the time to intervention for patients.
We have established partnerships with experienced cell therapy contract manufacturers to supply clinical materials and manufacturing services for our clinical trials. As we scale within our clinical trials and prepare for commercialization, we plan to increase capacity with our current suppliers and expand through our collaboration with Kite. Per the Kite Collaboration Agreement, Kite will manufacture CART-ddBCMA following technical transfer of our manufacturing process to Kite, and Kite will bear the CMC commercial readiness costs and associated capital expenses. The parties will continue to split manufacturing costs for clinical material.
 The manufacturing process for our ARC-T-cells is consistent with the CART-ddBCMA process. However, cells are transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding our universal ARC, which is a CAR with an anti-TAG binding domain, in lieu of a lentiviral vector encoding the CAR construct with a ddBCMA binding domain. Because our ARC-T-cells are designed to express the same TAG-specific binding domain rather than a cell surface antigen-specific binding domain, the same lentiviral vector encoding the universal ARC can be used for every patient regardless of disease or target antigen.
SparX Protein
We manufacture SparX proteins in-house for most research activities, but we use a third-party CMO for most preclinical studies, and all clinical trials. We produce research SparX proteins in mammalian and microbial systems using fermentation and protein purification strategies that we believe can be scaled for commercial purposes. The purified SparX protein is formulated to the desired concentration and then put into the desired formulation buffer. Every SparX protein is monitored throughout the purification process and afterwards using an array of analytical tests that assess SparX protein size, binding activity and potential biophysical changes in the SparX protein. We anticipate the process will evolve over time to improve yields, quality and quantity of recovered SparX protein.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the oncology subsector, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. Any candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies as well as therapies that may be developed in the future. While we believe our D-Domain, ddCAR and ARC-SparX platforms and scientific expertise provide us with a number of key advantages, we face substantial competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
 We anticipate substantial direct competition from other organizations developing advanced CAR-Ts, other types of genetically modified cell therapies, or other anti-BCMA biologics due to their promising clinical therapeutic effect in clinical trials including: 2seventy, Abbvie, Allogene, Amgen, Autolus, Bristol-Myers Squibb, CARSgen, Cartesian, Cellular Biomedicine Group, Gilead, Gracell, GSK, Innovent, Johnson & Johnson, Legend, Novartis, Nanjing IASO Biotherapeutics Ltd, Pfizer, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences, Pregene, Regeneron and Roche. In addition, some companies, such as Allogene, Caribou Biosciences, Cellectis, Celyad, and Crispr, are developing allogeneic cell therapies that could compete with our product candidate.
 We cannot predict whether other types of CAR-T or other genetically modified cell therapies may be developed and demonstrate greater efficacy, and we may have direct and substantial competition from such therapies in the future. Further, despite the unique approach that we have developed to address the limitations of CAR-T and other types of genetically modified cell therapies, we expect to face increasing competition as new, more effective treatments for cancer enter the market and further

advancements in technologies are made. We expect market adoption of any treatments that we develop and commercialize to be dependent on, among other things, efficacy, safety, delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, gene therapy and cell therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our product candidates.
 Commercialization
 In light of our current stage of development, we are in the early phases of establishing a commercial organization and distribution capabilities. Prior to approval of any of our product candidates, we intend to establish a commercialization infrastructure for those products. Additionally, pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we and Kite will be jointly responsible for commercialization of CART-ddBCMA and certain other MM cell therapy products, if approved by the FDA, in the United States and will leverage Kite’s commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution. Kite will be responsible for commercialization of CART-ddBCMA and such other MM products, outside the United States, to the extent they are approved by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Licenses and Collaborations
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Kite Pharma, Inc.
 In December 2022, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the Kite Collaboration Agreement) with Kite Pharma, Inc., a Gilead company (Kite), to co-develop and co-commercialize CART-ddBCMA and next-generation autologous and non-autologous CAR-T cell therapy products that use the same D-domain BCMA binder used in CART-ddBCMA, in each case for the treatment of MM. We also granted Kite an option to include autologous CAR-T-cell therapy products that utilize our ARC-SparX platform that are directed to BCMA, such as ACLX-001, as well as ARC-SparX products directed to CS1. We received a $225 million upfront cash payment in February 2023 and will be eligible to receive up to approximately $3.9 billion in clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments. In the United States, we and Kite will equally share profits and losses from the commercialization of the CART-ddBCMA and any next-generation autologous CAR-T cell therapy product for which we may exercise our option to co-promote with Kite (collectively, the Co-Promote Products). For Co-Promote Products outside of the United States and for any other products we may license to Kite that are not a Co-Promote Product (Non-Co-Promote Products), we will be eligible for tiered royalties in the low to mid teen percentages.
We and Kite will jointly develop the Co-Promote Products in accordance with mutually agreed development plans and development budgets. We will conduct the iMMagine-1 trial for CART-ddBCMA and Kite will conduct all other development of the other Co-Promote Products. Other than certain items expressly set forth in the Kite Collaboration Agreement, the out-of-pocket development costs for activities conducted in the United States for Co-Promote Products will be shared equally by us and Kite, and the out-of-pocket development costs for activities conducted outside the United States as part of a global clinical trial for Co-Promote Products will be borne 60% by Kite and 40% by us, however Kite will be solely responsible for the costs for country-specific clinical trials and CMC commercial readiness. Kite will be solely responsible for the conduct of development of the Non-Co-Promote Products at its sole cost. In the United States, we and Kite will be jointly responsible for commercialization of the Co-Promote Products. Kite will be responsible, at its sole cost, for commercialization of the Co-Promote Products outside the United States and the Non-Co-Promote Products worldwide. Kite will manufacture the licensed products and bear the CMC commercial readiness costs and capital expenses, except that we are responsible for manufacturing the CART-ddBCMA prior to transferring the manufacturing process to Kite.
Unless earlier terminated, the Kite Collaboration Agreement will continue in effect until no licensed products are being developed or commercialized. The Kite Collaboration Agreement is subject to customary termination provisions including termination by a party for the other party’s uncured, material breach. In the event of certain terminations of the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we are entitled to certain reversionary rights with respect to the terminated products.


The Kite Collaboration Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and terms governing the prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property.
 In connection with the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) and a standstill and stock restriction agreement (the Standstill Agreement) with Gilead Sciences (Gilead) in December 2022, pursuant to which, upon closing in January 2023, we issued and sold to Gilead 3,478,261 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $100.0 million and Gilead agreed to certain transfer and standstill restrictions and received certain registration rights.
 Development, Evaluation and License Agreement with Pfenex Inc.
In December 2018, we entered into a Development, Evaluation and License Agreement with Pfenex Inc. pursuant to which we obtained the option to obtain worldwide, sublicensable, exclusive licenses to incorporate certain proprietary SparX proteins into our ARC-SparX platform. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfenex is eligible to receive development funding in addition to development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to an aggregate of $19.3 million for each product incorporating a SparX protein expressed using a production strain based on the technology licensed from Pfenex, as well as low single-digit royalties during the royalty term on worldwide net sales of any such products. The royalty term is on a licensed SparX protein-by-licensed SparX protein and country-by-country basis and the shorter of (i) ten years from the date of first commercial sale and (ii) three months after the launch of a generic drug in such country. Such royalties for combination product are subject to certain net sales adjustments. Arcellx may terminate its licenses to individual proprietary SparX proteins at any time upon prior written notice. Either party may terminate for a materially uncured breach subject to a disputed breach resolution mechanism.
Intellectual Property
Developing intellectual property is a vital component of our business plan for maximizing return on our investments. We actively develop intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending United States and international patent rights for our product candidates, processes, and our discovery, development, and therapeutic platforms. We pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the commercial development of our business and our competitive position. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of the technology, inventions and improvements that cannot be patented but are important to the development of our business and competitive position. We have spent considerable effort securing intellectual property rights, including patent rights related to our proprietary D-Domain binding domain, ARC and SparX protein technologies and to our product candidates.
As of December 31, 2022, we own four patent families directed to the proprietary D-Domain binding domain technology.
•The first patent family includes three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and several pending foreign patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, the European Patent Organization, India, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore.

 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know-how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Our trademark portfolio currently contains pending U.S. trademark applications for the ARCELLX, ARCELLX logo, ARC-SPARX, ARC-T, SPARX, SPARX PROTEINS and SPARX PROTEIN trademarks, and some corresponding foreign trademark applications and registrations.
We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Therefore, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
The patent and other intellectual property positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our

development, commercial strategies, drugs or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products. Generally, before a new biopharmaceutical product can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety, purity and potency must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. Potency is interpreted to mean the specific ability or capacity of the product, as indicated by appropriate laboratory tests or by adequately controlled clinical data obtained through the administration of the product in the manner intended, to effect a given result.
U.S. Biopharmaceutical Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates biopharmaceuticals under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Biopharmaceuticals also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biologics must be licensed by the FDA under the PHSA through the submission of a BLA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements; 
 •Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the potency, purity and safety of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •Submission to the FDA of a BLA; 
 •A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review; 
 •Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •Potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; 


•FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States; and 
 •Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
 The data required to support a BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product biochemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for toxicity and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use for supporting subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials 


may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the investigational product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigational product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the biochemical and physical characteristics of the investigational product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
Since March 2020, the FDA has issued various COVID-19 related guidance documents for sponsors and manufacturers, including guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, among others. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations is unclear.
 Compliance with cGMP and GTP Requirements
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined.
The FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidances that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspection that follow a “risk based schedule” may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide,

on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, biochemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality, identity, purity and other relevant data. In short, the BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s FY 2023 fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2023, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is approximately $3.2 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human biologic ($393,933 in FY 2023) and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes physicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and

information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
For biologic drug products, an orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the indication for which it is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For biologics, the sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving a BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.

A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a biologic shown to be potent can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
 Additionally, a drug product may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drug products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
RMAT Designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress created the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, a product candidate that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like some of FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process.
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilars or Interchangeable Biosimilars
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law in 2010, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:
•Analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; 
 •Animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and 
 •A clinical trial or trials (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used. 


In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:
•The proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product; 
 •The condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product; 
 •The route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and 
 •The facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent. 
 Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
•The proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product; 
 •The proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and 
 •For a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. 
 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an orphan drug) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug

promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new application or supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
 •Warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 
 •Applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet

applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: changes to our manufacturing arrangements; additions or modifications to product labeling; the recall or discontinuation of our products; or additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize any of our product candidates, including countries in Europe and Asia. Such foreign regulations govern, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of a clinical trial or marketing of a product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar approval process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the E.U. clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the E.U.

Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the E.U. countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The E.U. clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process, In particular, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) became applicable on January 31, 2022, repealing the EU Clinical Trials Directive. The implementation of the CTR also includes the implementation of the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trial portal and database that will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the EU Member States. Complying with changes in regulatory requirements can incur additional costs, delay our clinical development plans, or expose us to greater liability if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or new requirements or policies governing our business operations, including our clinical trials.
E.U. Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of Marketing Authorizations:
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for products that are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
PRIME Designation in the E.U.
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines (PRIME) scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated

EMA contact and rapporteur from CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by

Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs, or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization. These and other health reform measures that are implemented may have a material adverse effect on our operations.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. There is an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States with respect to healthcare costs and prescription drug prices and we expect it will continue to increase and exert greater pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework could reduce our ability to generate revenue in the future or increase our costs, either of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations is unclear. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payers of healthcare services and medical products to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect the demand for our product candidates, if approved, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.

In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, in order to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product in the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally, prices tend to be significantly lower.
