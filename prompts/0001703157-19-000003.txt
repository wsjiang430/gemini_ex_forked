Item 1. Business
Overview of Our Business
 
SecureTech was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on March 2, 2017 under the name SecureTech, Inc. We amended our Articles of Incorporation on December 20, 2017 to change our name to SecureTech Innovations, Inc.
 
SecureTech is an emerging growth company focused on developing and marketing personal and automobile security and safety devices and technologies. Through a licensed patent SecureTech has developed its initial product, Top Kontrol, which we believe to be the only anti-theft and personal safety automobile device that can thwart a carjacking attempt without any action by driver. Whereas our competitors’ products are engineered to flash lights and sound loud alarms when someone is tampering with a parked and unoccupied automobile, our Top Kontrol product is engineered to turn off the engine and completely disable the vehicle should someone other than the authorized driver attempt to drive the vehicle.
 
Through its advanced design and use of a licensed patent, Top Kontrol can tell the difference between an authorized driver and an unauthorized thief or carjacker through the use of strategically placed sensors in the automobile and a unique FOB device hidden on the authorized driver’s person. Regardless of whether someone tries to steal your vehicle while it is innocently idling unattended in the parking lot or take it by force at gunpoint, Top Kontrol will only allow the unauthorized driver to drive for 15-20 seconds before automatically turning the engine off and preventing any attempt to restart the engine. This prevents the thief from stealing your car and/or allows the driver sufficient time to run to safety after being threatened at gunpoint. SecureTech is not aware of any other product on the market that solves the carjacking problem in the manner of Top Kontrol.
 
Because Top Kontrol is connected to the automobile’s ignition and lighting systems, it must be installed and serviced by a licensed dealer. 
 
SecureTech has not initiated any commercial production runs with any contract manufacturer. All of the products we have manufactured to date have been prototype models for testing purposes only. We do not intend to initiate commercial production until the second half of fiscal 2019.
 
Implications of Being an “Emerging Growth Company”
 
As a public reporting company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:

• | are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis);
• | are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes); 
• | are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 
• | may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A; 
• | are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act; and 
• | are exempt from any PCAOB rules relating to mandatory audit firm rotation and any requirement to include an auditor discussion and analysis narrative in our audit report. 

 
We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.
 
Certain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Furthermore, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we (i) have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (ii) for so long as we have a public float of zero, have annual revenues of less than $50 million during our most recently completed fiscal year.
 
Investors should be aware that we are also subject to the “Penny Stock” rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in Penny Stocks. These regulations may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for our stock, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares. Please see the disclosures under “Penny Stock Considerations” on page 33 for more information.
 
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
 
There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an emerging growth business with limited operating history. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns, such as increases in marketing costs, increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations, increases in accounting and audit fees, and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance.

As of December 31, 2018 we had incurred ($221,291) in losses since our inception on March 2, 2017. We have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses throughout the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and potentially into subsequent fiscal periods. We expect to incur significant operating expenses and, as a result, will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may never occur. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis which could cause us to go out of business.
 
To become profitable and competitive, we have to successfully sell our current product, Top Kontrol, and continue to innovate and develop new similar personal and automobile security and safety devices and technologies that will be accepted by the marketplace. We anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses, which may never happen. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We may also rely on loans from our management or other significant shareholders. However, there are no assurances that management or any of our significant shareholders will provide us with any additional funds in the future.
 
We are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash, including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans. We cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. Further, future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.
 
Going Concern
 
Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. For more information their report is included in this annual report on page F-2.
Top Kontrol Product
 


SecureTech’s first anti-theft and automobile safety product is called Top Kontrol. Utilizing exclusively licensed patented technology created originally by our Founder, Kao Lee, SecureTech had developed a very competitively priced product that significantly outperforms all other known competing products currently on the market.
Key Advantages of the Top Kontrol Product:
 

• | Anti-theft circuits actively prevent automobile theft and/or carjacking 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Automatic secure feature prevents car from being stolen while keys are in ignition and/or engine is idling 
• | Active and passive prevention of carjacking 
• | Does not interfere with other systems in the vehicle 
• | Works with all makes and models of cars, trucks and motorcycles 
• | Manual engine kill switch 
• | Key based system to prevent hijacking of wirelessly transmitted security codes 
• | No 24/7 power feeding which prevents short-circuiting the system with a power surge, a common method thieves use to disable our competitors’ systems

 
Unlike our competitors’ products which are designed to primarily protect the automobile from unattended theft, we’ve developed Top Kontrol to put driver and passenger safety first while still protecting the automobile from theft, even when the engine is running. We believe Top Kontrol is the only anti-theft and personal safety automobile device able to thwart a carjacking attempt without any action by driver.

Through its advanced design and use of the licensed patent, Top Kontrol can tell the difference between an authorized driver and an unauthorized thief or carjacker. Regardless of whether someone tries to steal your vehicle while it is innocently idling unattended in the parking lot or take it by force at gunpoint, Top Kontrol will only allow the unauthorized driver to drive for 15-20 seconds before automatically turning the engine off and preventing any attempt to restart the engine. This prevents the thief from stealing your car and/or allows the driver sufficient time to run to safety after being threatened at gunpoint.
 
Because Top Kontrol is connected to the automobile’s ignition and lighting systems, it must be installed and serviced by a licensed dealer. 
 
Made in USA
 
SecureTech exclusively uses US contract manufacturers and labor to manufacture and assemble its products. SecureTech does not have any long-term or exclusive arrangements with any single contract manufacturer and is free to change or negotiate with new contract manufacturers at its sole discretion. This allows SecureTech to scale production levels as it deems appropriate.
 
All of SecureTech’s products proudly carry the “Made in USA” designation.
 
SecureTech has not initiated any commercial production runs with any contract manufacturer. All of the products we have manufactured to date have been prototype models for testing purposes only. We do not intend to initiate commercial production until the second half of fiscal 2019.
 
Competition
 
SecureTech faces formidable competition in every aspect of our business. The success or failure of our business will depend largely upon the ability of our management to develop competitive products and properly market them to attract a sufficient number of new customers which will allow us to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable.
 
SecureTech will be competing against better established competitors with substantially greater financial resources and a longer history of operations. Our competitors’ resources and market presence may provide them with advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leverage. Some of our better known competitors include Viper (www.viper.com) and LoJack Corporation (www.lojack.com). Below is a table providing a comparison overview of these competitors’ product offerings:

In addition to the competitors listed above, we will be competing with other lesser known competitors as well as competitors presently not known to us or, possibly, not even formed yet.
 
We believe that our industry is large enough that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors with our existing and future products. However, it is important to note that the underlying product technology is always evolving and expanding with new competitors continuously innovating better products that could eventually outperform our then offered products or, worse, possibly render them obsolete.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
SecureTech intends to use a two-pronged approach to marketing for our current and future products to prospective customers, including direct marketing efforts and authorized dealer sales. 
Direct Marketing
 
SecureTech intends to build brand and product awareness through traditional marketing avenues, including:
 

• | Traditional paid advertising (e.g. periodical and trade publications, television, and radio)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Online and Social Media 
• | Pay-Per-Click Internet Advertising 
• | Free Media Exposure (e.g. free theft prevention and safety courses and videos) 

Authorized Dealer/Licensed Installer Sales
 
SecureTech intends to internally develop a sales team of representatives that will sell SecureTech’s products to car dealerships (new and used), car audio stores, body shops, and other similar venues. SecureTech will augment its own sales force with commission based independent sales representatives, both domestically and internationally.
Government Regulation
 
SecureTech will be subject to domestic and international laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its products and operations. These laws and regulations include common business practices, tax rules and securities regulations pertaining to the operation of its business, and product warranties and safety requirements. SecureTech believes that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of the management of SecureTech to ensure that it remains in compliance with all applicable regulations as they apply to the SecureTech’s products as well as ensuring that SecureTech does not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to its products. SecureTech will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain complaint with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability it incurs. 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our inception on March 2, 2017.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We have exclusively licensed United States Patent No. 8,436,721 from Shongkawh, LLC, a related party. Pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement, SecureTech will pay Shongkawh two-percent (2%) of all gross sales generated on all products sold incorporating the technology covered by this patent.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act") was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things: 
 

• | Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; 
• | Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 
• | Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and 
• | Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.

 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ("IPO") of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:
 
(i)
the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, 
 
(ii)
the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO; 
 
(iii)
the company's issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
 
(iv)
the company becoming a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact SecureTech are discussed below. 

9

Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows: 
 
(i)
audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years; 
 
(ii)
selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited; and 
 
(iii)
executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter) 
 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. SecureTech is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations. 
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule. 
 
The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the company's accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit. 
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the company's independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes. 
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO. 
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Securities Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow. 
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. 
 
The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. SecureTech has elected not to opt out of the transition period pursuant to Section 107(b).
