Industry Background
1

Over the years, our products have evolved significantly from scoreboards and matrix displays with related software applications to complex, integrated visual display systems which include full color video with text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network that are tied together through sophisticated control systems.  In the mid-1990's, as light emitting diodes (“LEDs”) became available in red, blue and green colors with outdoor brightness, we pioneered the development of full color LED video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors, thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color, brightness, energy efficiency and lifetime.  Due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems, we were able to add video capabilities so we could meet all our customers' large format display needs in a complete, integrated system.  This has proven to be a key factor in Daktronics becoming a leader in large electronic displays.  LED technologies continue to evolve and advance, creating new high-resolution and micro-LED display options. Today, the industry continues development in both the construct of the micro-LED and production methods of micro-LED display panels using mass-transfer technology.
Description of Business
We are engaged in a full range of activities: marketing and sales, engineering and product design and development, manufacturing, technical contracting, professional services and customer service and support.  Each of those activities is described below:
Marketing and Sales.  Our sales force is comprised of direct sales staff and resellers located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service. We primarily use a direct sales force for large integrated display system sales in professional sports, colleges and universities, and commercial spectacular projects.  We also use our direct sales force to sell third-party advertising and transportation applications. We utilize resellers outside North America for large integrated system sales where we do not have a direct sales presence.  The majority of our products sold by resellers in North America are standard catalog products.  We support our resellers through direct mail/email advertising, trade journal advertising, product and installation training, trade show exhibitions and accessibility to our regional sales or service teams and demonstration equipment.
Engineering and Product Design and Development.  The large format electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services.  To remain competitive, we have a tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to anticipate and respond rapidly to the system needs in the marketplace. We employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design; applications engineering; software design; quality design; and customer and product support.  We assign product managers to each product family to assist our sales staff in training and implementing product improvements which ensures each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability.  We employ process engineers to assist in quality and reliability processing in our product design testing and manufacturing areas. 
Manufacturing. The majority of our products are manufactured in the United States, specifically in South Dakota and Minnesota. We also have manufacturing facilities in China and Ireland. We perform component manufacturing, system manufacturing (metal fabrication, electronic assembly, sub-assembly and final assembly) and testing in-house for most of our products to control quality, improve response time and maximize cost-effectiveness. Our manufacturing facilities are somewhat aligned with our business segments' sales, marketing, and product design and development areas to accelerate technology improvements and improve our cost structure. Given the cyclical nature of some parts of our business and dispersed sales geography, we balance and maintain our ability to manufacture the same products across our plants so we can efficiently utilize our capacity and reduce costs. A key strategy of ours is to increase standardization and commonality of parts and manufacturing processes across product lines through use of product platforms to increase efficiencies. Other strategies include supplier management programs and lean manufacturing techniques. For more details on our facilities, see "Part II, Item 2. Properties".
Technical Contracting.  We serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations requiring custom designs and innovative product solutions.  The purchase of display systems typically involves competitive proposals.  As part of our response to a proposal request, we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system.  We usually include site preparation and installation services related to the display system in our proposal.  In these cases, we serve as a contractor and may retain subcontractors for electrical, steel and installation labor.  We have developed relationships with many subcontractors throughout the United States and the world, which is an advantage for us in bidding and delivering on these projects. We are licensed as a general contractor in many jurisdictions.  
Professional Services. To assist our clients' ability to engage, inform and entertain their audiences, we provide professional services including event support, content creation, product maintenance, marketing assistance, training on hardware and software, control room design, and continuing technical support training for operators. 
Customer Service and Support.  We offer limited warranties on our products, ranging from one to 10 years, against failure due to defective parts or workmanship. In addition, we offer service agreements of various scopes.  To serve our customers, we provide help-desk access, parts repair and replacement, display monitoring and on-site support.  Our technical help desk has experienced technicians who are on-call 24 hours a day to support events and sites. Our field service personnel and third-party service partners are trained to provide on-site support. We use third-party service partners to allow us to respond to changes in volume of service during our seasonal peaks.

Products and Technologies
The two principal components of our systems are the display and the controller, which manages the operation of the display.  We produce displays varying in complexity, size and resolution.  The physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area, the distance from the viewer to the display, and the amount and type of information to be displayed.  The controller is comprised of computer hardware and software products designed to compile information provided by the operator and other integrated sources to display information, graphics or animation on the displays. We customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment in which our products function.
Our products are comprised of the following product families, all of which include software and controller options:
•Video displays 
•Scoreboards and timing systems 
•Message displays
•ITS (intelligent transportation systems) dynamic message signs 
•Space availability displays
•Sound systems
•Out-of-Home advertising displays
•Digit and price displays
•Indoor dynamic messaging systems
Each of these product families is described below:
Video Displays.  These displays are comprised of a large number of full-color pixels capable of showing various levels of video, graphics and animation.  These displays include red, green and blue LEDs arranged in various combinations to form pixels.  The electronic circuitry, which controls the pixels, allows for variances in the relative brightness of each LED to provide a full color spectrum, thereby displaying video images in striking, vibrant colors. Variables in video displays include the spacing of the pixels (pixel pitch), the resolution of the displays (number of pixels), the brightness of the displays (nits), the number of discrete colors the display is able to produce (color depth), the viewing angles, and the LED mount technology (surface mount vs. through-hole). 
We offer a broad range of indoor and outdoor LED video displays with these varying features. Examples of indoor offerings include centerhung displays, landmark displays, video walls, ribbon board displays, hanging banners, corporate office entrance displays, and video displays designed for retail stores, restaurants, malls, transportation hubs and other similar indoor facilities. 
 Video displays provide content to serve as a revenue generation source through advertising, an information and communication medium (e.g. scoring, statistics, way-finding, advertising), or provide interior design elements to create luxurious space to feature digital art.
Our mobile and modular display systems are transportable and are comprised of lightweight individual LED video panels less than a square meter in size and are assembled together to form a display in a customizable size.  These displays are used for both indoor and outdoor touring shows and for other live events.
Our display technology may be integrated with architectural mesh to deliver a dynamic communication medium that provides a semi-transparent viewing experience within a building. These displays can be mounted over a solid facade or in front of windows, resulting in a finished solution that is free from visible cabling and delivers a clean, semi-transparent view. These displays are less than one inch in depth and provide an elegant, refined structural appearance.
Our line of freeform LED displays is architectural lighting and display products. The ProPixel® freeform products use mountable LED elements to transform ordinary structures into stunning visual landmarks. A flexible mounting platform allows designers to transform any structure into a full-motion video display. 
The control components for video displays in live event applications include our Show Control Software Suite, proprietary digital media players and video processors. These control components provide advanced capabilities for the display of live video and real-time content on our displays. The Show Control Software Suite can operate entire networks of displays from a single, intuitive control interface.  Its features allow users to instantly deliver media clips, camera feeds, and streaming information to any display in a network. 
Scoreboards and Timing Systems.  Our line of scoreboards and timing products include indoor and outdoor scoreboards for many different sports, digit displays, scoring and timing controllers, statistics software and other related products.  Indoor and outdoor systems range in complexity from small scoreboards to larger systems incorporating scoring, timing, video, message centers, advertising panels and control software.

We offer a variety of controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays.  These controllers vary in complexity from the All Sport® 100, a handheld controller for portable scoreboards, to the All Sport® 5500, designed for more sophisticated scoring systems and allowing for more user-defined options.  
We also offer timing systems for sports events, primarily aquatics and track competitions.  A component of these systems is our OmniSport® 2000 timing console.  The system has the capability to time and rank the competitors and to interface with event management software to facilitate the sporting event.  Other timing system components include swimming touchpads, race start systems, and relay take-off platforms.
As a key component of an integrated system, we market sports statistics and results software under the DakStats® trademark.  The software allows the entry and display of sports statistics and other information.  It is one of the leading applications of its type in collegiate and high school sports.
Message Displays.  The Galaxy® product line is a family of full-matrix displays, available in both indoor and outdoor models and controlled with the Venus® Control Suite. Galaxy® displays are full color or monochrome with varying pixel spacing depending on color, size and viewing distance. Galaxy® displays can display text, graphics and animation, as well as prerecorded video clips. They are used primarily as message centers to convey information and advertising to consumers.  
The Venus® Control Suite software is used to control the creation of messages and graphic sequences for uploading to the Galaxy® displays.  This software is designed to be user friendly and applicable to all general advertising or message applications.  It can be used to control a single message display or can scale up to provide a secure, cloud-based control center for large networks of message displays.  
ITS Dynamic Message Signs ("DMS"). DMS products include a wide range of LED displays for road management, mass transit and aviation applications.  The Vanguard® family of dynamic message displays is typically used to direct traffic and inform motorists.  These displays are used over freeways, on arterial roads, near bridges, at toll booths and in other locations.  We have also developed a control system for these displays to help transportation agencies manage large networks of displays.
Space Availability Displays. This product line is our digit and directional displays, which are primarily marketed and sold for use in parking facilities.  They include multi-line displays delivered in vertical cabinets or drop-in digit panels designed to be mounted in existing structures or signs.
Sound Systems.  Our sound systems include both standard and custom options.  Standard systems are designed to meet the needs of a variety of indoor and outdoor sports venues based on the size and configuration of the facility.  Custom indoor and outdoor systems are tailored for larger venues and venues with unique seating configurations and are often integrated into an overall venue solution for scoring, timing, message display and/or video capability. Our audio systems also complement our video display systems used in mall applications.
Out-of-Home Advertising Displays.  Our line of out-of-home advertising displays includes billboards and street furniture displays. Our line of digital billboards offers a unique display solution for the Out-of-Home (“OOH”) advertising industry.  The products are used to display images which change at regular intervals.  These systems include many features unique to the outdoor advertising market, such as our patented mounting system, self-adjusting brightness, improved energy consumption, and enhanced network security.
Our line of digital street furniture engages people with advertising content at eye level as they walk through campuses, cityscapes, and outlet malls. This design enhances the message and complements surrounding architecture. These street furniture displays are our most flexible solution for digital OOH campaigns.
Digit and Price Displays.  This product line includes our DataTime® and Fuelight™ displays. The DataTime® product line consists of outdoor time and temperature displays which use a remote sensor for temperature data. Fuelight™ digit displays are specifically designed for the petroleum industry, offering high visibility and quick fuel price updates using the Fuelink™ control software.

Raw Materials
4

Materials used in the production of our video display systems are sourced from around the world. Examples of the materials we use in production include LEDs, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, power supplies, plastics, aluminum, and steel. We source some of our materials from a single-source or a limited number of suppliers due to the proprietary nature of the materials. The loss of a key supplier, part unavailability, price changes or defects in the supplied material or component could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.  Our sourcing group works to implement strategies to mitigate these risks. Periodically, we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract, which generally does not exceed one year.
During fiscal 2019, many electrical components were in high demand or market factors impacted availability, both of which caused extended lead-times and price volatility and resulted in an additional cost of $3.8 million for these materials. We also incurred $2.5 million of tariff related expenses on imports of materials to the U.S. due to the U.S. administration's implementation of tariffs on aluminum, steel, and items made in China. We believe this estimate is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance; however, this estimate is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), and our methodology for determining this estimate may vary from the methodology used by other companies.
Intellectual Property
We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis. Our policy is to protect our competitive position by filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. This will allow us to pursue infringement claims against competitors for protection due to patent violations. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements with our employees and agents to protect our intellectual property.  Despite these intellectual property protections, there can be no assurance a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products.
Seasonality
Our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of uniquely configured orders, such as display systems for professional sports facilities, colleges and universities, and spectacular projects in the commercial area, as well as the seasonality of the sports market. Uniquely configured orders can include several displays, controllers, and subcontracted structure builds, each of which can occur on varied schedules per the customer's needs. Outdoor installation sales can be impacted by outdoor weather conditions and the construction season. Our third fiscal quarter tends to be a slower quarter because it includes two holidays, it is affected by sports seasonality, and generally less outdoor construction work occurs due to weather conditions. 
Our gross margins tend to fluctuate more on uniquely configured orders than on limited configured orders.  Uniquely configured orders involving competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins.  Although we follow the over time method of recognizing revenues for uniquely configured orders, we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations. 
Because of the seasonality and volatility in business demand and variety of product types, we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may negatively affect our business and operating results.
Working Capital
For information regarding working capital items, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-K.
Customers
We have a large and diverse worldwide customer base, ranging from local main street business owners and out-of-home companies to the owners and operators of premier professional sports arenas. Our customers are important to us, and we strive to serve them over the long-term to earn their future business. The loss of one or more customers could have an adverse effect on us. See "Note 3. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for our primary markets and customers of each business unit.
Backlog
Our remaining performance obligations ("backlog") consist of contractually binding sales agreements or purchase orders for integrated electronic display systems and related products and service. Orders are included in backlog when we are in receipt of an executed contract and any required deposits or security. As a result, certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be included in backlog until all required contractual documents and deposits are received. Backlog can fluctuate due to large order 
5

bookings and the timing and seasonality of net sales. Because order backlog fluctuates and may be subject to extended delivery schedules, orders may be canceled and have varied estimated profitability. Our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income. Backlog is not a measure defined by GAAP, and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts.
Our backlog as of April 27, 2019 was $257 million as compared to $219 million as of April 28, 2018. We expect to fulfill this backlog within the next 24 months.
Government and Other Regulation
In the United States and other countries, various laws, regulations and ordinances related to our products and controllers restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays, particularly in the commercial and transportation markets.  These laws and regulations impose greater restrictions on electronic displays versus non-electronic displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. Globally, our products are also subject to various regulations and standards including electromagnetic interference, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, and flammability standards. We design and have our products tested for these regulations; however, these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers in certain geographies.
Our manufacturing facilities and products comply with industry specific requirements, including environmental rules and regulations and safety standards. These requirements include quality, manufacturing process controls, manufacturing documentation, supplier certification of raw materials, and various safety tests. Our products and production processes require the storage, use and disposal of a variety of hazardous chemicals under applicable laws. 
Our global supply chain and sales distribution channels subject us to various trade compliance regulations. These requirements can include certification of country of origin, classification within the various tariff codes and trade agreements, compliance with other specific product or country import/export regulations, and payment of certain import or export tariffs, duties, or taxes. 
Our global operations subject us to various laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to tax compliance, anti-corruption, and data privacy. These requirements vary and can include things like records management, policy creation and maintenance, data protection programs, compliance filings, and continued training of employees. 
We believe we are in material compliance with these requirements.
Competition
We encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product, geographic area, and business unit. Our competitors include both United States and foreign companies and range in size and product offerings. Our competitors may develop lower-cost or lower-featured products, may be willing to charge lower prices to increase their market share, or include different service and controller offerings.  Some competitors have more capital and other resources, which may allow them to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements. Other competitors use sponsorships as a way to win business at a particular location or market. In addition, our products compete with other forms of advertising, such as television, print media and fixed display signs. 
We believe that our ability to compete depends upon customer centric product and service quality and features, technical expertise, service breadth, and cost-effective solutions.
Research and Development
Our engineering, process design, and product and service design and development capabilities and experience are very important factors in continuing to develop, produce, and offer the most up-to-date digital displays and control system solutions desired by the market. 
Employees
As of April 27, 2019, we employed approximately 2,412 full-time employees and 310 part-time and temporary employees.  Of these employees, approximately 879 were in manufacturing, 570 were in sales and marketing, 570 were in customer service, 450 were in engineering and 253 were in general and administrative.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe employee relations are good.
