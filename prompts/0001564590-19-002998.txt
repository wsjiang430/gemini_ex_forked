Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Paycom,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Paycom Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.  
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management (“HCM”) solution delivered as Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”). We provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. Our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all HCM functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources (“HR”) management applications. Our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their HCM activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.
 Organizations need sophisticated, flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving HCM requirements, streamline their HR processes and systems and enable them to control costs. We believe the HCM needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive SaaS product or, to a lesser extent, by legacy providers offering outdated on-premise products.  These approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity, low scalability, high costs, extended delivery times and large up-front capital requirements.
 Because our solution was developed in-house and is based on a single platform, there is no need to integrate, update or access multiple databases, which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple third-party systems in order to link together their HCM offerings. Additionally, our solution maintains data integrity for accurate, actionable and real-time analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risks of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information. We deliver feature-rich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards, as evidenced by our International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certifications. 
 We sell our solution directly through our internally trained, client-focused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the United States. As a part of our client retention effort, a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industry-leading, personalized service. We have over 23,500 clients, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We believe that as a result of our focus on client retention, we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 92%, 91% and 91% from existing clients for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate is decreased by former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations.
 We were founded in 1998. Since our founding, we have focused on providing an innovative SaaS HCM solution. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,050 employees across the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our 
 1



revenues were $566.3 million, $433.0 million and $329.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth in revenues of approximately 31% and 32%, respectively. We currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing. We are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other applications. We generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price. We realized net income of $137.1 million, $123.5 million and $70.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 The Paycom Solution
 We offer an end-to-end SaaS HCM solution that provides our clients and their employees with immediate access to accurate and secure information and analytics at any time from any location where internet service is available. We believe our solution delivers the following benefits:
Comprehensive HCM Solution
 Our solution offers functionality that manages the entire employment lifecycle for employers and employees, from recruitment to retirement. Our user-friendly applications streamline client processes and provide clients and their employees with the ability to directly access and manage administrative processes, including applications that identify candidates, on-board employees, manage time and labor, administer payroll deductions and benefits, manage performance, terminate employees and administer post-termination health benefits such as COBRA. The widespread employee usage of our applications further integrates our solution into the administrative processes of our clients. Our solution also has the advantage of being built in-house by our highly trained and skilled team of software developers, thereby minimizing data integrity issues across applications.
Core System of Record
 Our solution is based on a core system of record that contains payroll and HR information in one convenient database, thereby reducing costs and eliminating the need for multiple software products and vendors and the maintenance of employee data in numerous databases. This core system of record enables our clients to input employee data one time and enjoy seamless functionality across our applications. When a revision is made to the file of an employee, all appropriate personnel have access to the change in real time. In addition, our core system of record helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information that results from maintaining multiple databases. Through accurate tracking and management of employee payroll and other HR data, such information can be compiled for comprehensive and consistent reporting for our clients.
Data Analytics and Business Intelligence
 Our solution’s core system of record allows clients to strategically analyze comprehensive and accurate employee information to make informed business decisions based upon actionable, real-time analytics provided through our client dashboard. This functionality allows our clients to operate with a more complete and accurate picture of their organization, as our solution’s embedded analytics capture the content and context of everyday business events, facilitating fast and informed decision-making from any location. These tools help clients reduce administrative and operational costs and better manage talent.
Enhanced Employee Experience 
 The employees of our clients also benefit from our HCM applications. As workforces transition from technology-savvy to technology-dependent, employees expect mobile technology and the resources necessary to readily access information and control their professional development. Through our employee self-service technology, employees can view real-time HR information, including pay stubs, W-2s and benefits information, as well as manage their schedules and vacation time and update W-4 contact information. Our mobile apps, available on both the Google Play™ store and the App Store® online store, make it easier for employees to access their self-service information.  Our apps have fingerprint and facial recognition capabilities, aiding employers in their efforts to engage technology-dependent workers.  Our system also allows employers to engage their workforce through learning management courses and training paths, surveys, and performance goals and reviews.
 In addition to our self-service, app-based functionality, we also provide our clients with a strategy to drive usage among their employees. This strategy includes training clients’ employees how to use the Paycom app during implementation and providing additional training from our client relations representatives. Allowing employees to make changes directly to our database creates efficiencies for both the employer and employee. Today’s employees have little tolerance for complexity, and with our solution, employees have become accustomed to having a direct relationship with their HR database. This relationship is directly correlated with our single-database that is key to increasing usage. Our strategy to promote employee usage of the Paycom system elevates HR personnel to focus on the human element of their jobs, creating a more positive culture and giving HR personnel more time to engage with their employees.
 Personalized Support Provided by Trained Personnel
 Our applications are supported by one-on-one personal assistance from trained specialists. Service specialists are assigned to specific clients and are trained across all of our applications, ensuring they provide comprehensive, expert-level service. Our client 
 2



service is ISO 9001:2015 certified on the basis of its quality and consistency. We strive to provide our clients with high levels of service and support to ensure their continued use of our solution for all of their HCM needs. We have maintained high client satisfaction, as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 92%, 91% and 91% from existing clients for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Software-as-a-Service Delivery Model
 Our SaaS delivery model allows clients with geographically dispersed and mobile workforces to operate more efficiently, and allows these clients to implement, access and use our client-oriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers, smart phones, tablets and other web-enabled devices. Our SaaS solution reduces the time, risk, headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for on-premise products within the information technology (“IT”) infrastructure of our clients.
Secure Cloud-Based Architecture
 Our cloud-based architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction. Updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction, disruption or involvement, allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware, personnel, implementation time and consulting. Additionally, we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients. Our focus on, and investment in, technology and data security has been recognized with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “best-in-class” level of data security.
 Scalability to Grow with our Clients
 Our solution is highly scalable. We serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, while our target client size range is 50 to 5,000 employees. We calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping. Our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications as-needed in real-time. Pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized, enabling our clients to align HCM spending with their evolving HCM needs as compared to traditional HCM products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size.
 Efficient and Productive Research and Development
 We believe we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments, people and processes. Early investments in our proprietary, cloud-based architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. We have also chosen to base our research and development team in Oklahoma and Texas, which we believe provides us with high-quality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the United States where there is more competition for technology talent. These strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function.
Our Strategy for Growth
 Our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the HCM industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets.  We intend to continue to open new sales offices as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets.  We will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients, as well as strengthening and extending our solution. 
Increase Our Presence in Existing Markets
 We believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office.  Each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team, with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals.  Although we have a sales office in 37 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) in the United States based on July 2017 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, only five of these MSAs are currently served by multiple Paycom sales teams.  In addition to expanding into new markets, we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets.  Since our initial public offering (“IPO”) in April 2014, we have expanded our presence within three MSAs that were already served by at least one Paycom sales team by opening new sales offices in Brooklyn, Chicago, Long Island and Pasadena.  
Expand Into Additional Markets
 We plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams. Since our IPO in April 2014, we have expanded into 14 new markets. 
 We have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density. When opening a new sales office, we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of high-performing sales representatives. It typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity.

Enlarge our Existing Client Relationships
 We dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals, whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions, manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently. We believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients. Many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution. As we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution, we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction.
Target Larger Clients
 The average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer. We serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, while our target client size is 50 to 5,000 employees.  Based on our total revenues, we have grown at a 39% compound annual growth rate from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018. Our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients. We believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us. To further capitalize on this opportunity, we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective.
Maintain Our Leadership in Innovation by Strengthening and Extending our Solution
 Our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and cost-effectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date. We intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future. Our development efforts are performed exclusively in-house and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input. We are focusing our investments on the development of new applications, enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients, which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration.
Our Applications 
 Our HCM solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories: talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and HR management.
Talent Acquisition
 
 
Applicant Tracking. Our applicant tracking application simplifies the recruiting processes needed to hire the most qualified employees. By using our all-in-one system, our clients can move candidates from the application process through new employee on-boarding without re-keying data. Organizations can maintain and easily access a list of potential employees from a talent pool with real-time candidate, recruiter and manager retrieval while eliminating manual redundancies. Clients can also distribute job openings and reach a wider candidate audience with tools to reach unlimited postings on a network of free job boards and manage fee-based job board accounts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candidate Tracker. Our candidate tracker application enables recruiters to track and stay connected to potential talent through an online database of top candidates. This application helps clients fill future positions faster and without the cost of professional recruiting firms. This feature allows clients to assemble a contact history searchable by school, degree, skill set, previous employer, ZIP code radius and follow-up date. 
Background Checks. Our background check application helps to ensure that prospective new hires are qualified candidates. Our application helps businesses perform instantaneous background checks where employers can choose the specific types of searches and how the screening results are issued. Additionally, employers are able to run background checks on existing employees at any time. 
On-Boarding. Our on-boarding application streamlines the hiring and termination processes for employees of our clients by creating online checklists of tasks to be assigned to an employee or group of employees. With our application, this process can begin even before a new hire’s first day on the job, helping the new hire be more productive on his or her first day. 
E-Verify ®. By allowing electronic signature verification and online storage, our E-Verify ® application automates employment verification and reduces our clients’ exposure to audits and penalties that could result from I-9 violations. 
Tax Credit Services. Our tax credit services application helps employers process and calculate the available federal tax credits associated with hiring employees who meet various qualifications, ensuring organizations opting into this service receive their share of government-appropriated funds. This application prescreens candidates to determine who is eligible for tax credits.

Time and Labor Management
 
 
Time and Attendance. Our time and attendance application allows our clients to accurately and efficiently manage when, where and how employees report their hours worked. Clients can apply customized rules, use batch editing and use timecard management tools to manage complex time and attendance needs. Employees can clock in and out at their desks with web-based time clocks or by using biometric, badgeswipe or other types of hardware terminals in a single or multiclock environment. Our web time clock feature allows employees to clock in and out using their mobile device or any device with an internet connection, which automatically updates the payroll application when approved, eliminating the need to manually calculate timesheets and re-key information into payroll systems. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scheduling/Schedule Exchange. Our scheduling application helps managers with employee scheduling through automated functionality that provides for a seamless workflow with the payroll and time and attendance applications. This application allows clients to create and edit templates for different pay classes. Our schedule exchange application allows employees and managers access to their schedules at any time and employees can approve, decline or swap their schedules and see what shifts are available for pickup. Email notifications are sent automatically to supervisors and employees when schedules are created, requests for shift exchanges are submitted or a shift change is approved or denied. 
Time-Off Requests. Our time-off requests application automates and standardizes the time-off request procedure and helps employers remain effectively staffed. Managers can view an online time-off calendar to easily monitor and approve or deny time-off requests. Managers can review paid time off requests via email and approve or deny such requests with ease. Our employee self-service tool allows employees to view the time-off they have available, submit requests and view blackout dates, the status of requests and any manager comments. 
Labor Allocation. Our labor allocation application simplifies the process of setting up and tracking employee hours based on the job the employee is working. 
Labor Management Reports/Push Reporting. Our labor management reports application provides clients with access to up-to-the-minute reports on the information they need to better manage their labor force, such as overtime and labor distribution. Our push reporting application also gives clients the ability to set up recurring reports and to schedule them to be run automatically and sent to users on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis. 
Geofencing/Geotracking. Enhancing our time and attendance solution, Paycom’s geofencing and geotracking location-based technology assist our clients in managing the whereabouts of employees while on the job. Geofencing allows employers to establish geographical boundaries within which their employees are authorized to clock in and out when using our web time clock on smartphones, tablets or other electronic devices. Once enabled, this time-theft-combatting tool supersedes IP address restrictions, meaning the system first checks for authorized geographical locations, rather than authorized IP addresses. In addition, the geotracking tool empowers clients to track employees’ geographical locations upon clocking in and out. The coordinates collected by the application can be entered into and viewed on a Google® display map. 

 5



Payroll
  
Payroll and Tax Management. Our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. Our payroll application is automatically updated with changes in employee information and offers other time saving functionality such as batch editing and effective dating. Enhanced payroll grid functionality allows clients to automate and delegate payroll functions to accelerate the processes, giving clients repeatable, reliable payroll processing with additional controls. The application can be accessed at any time to make changes, run payroll and generate custom reports. We also help our clients by handling their payroll taxes and deposits, regulatory correspondence and amendments as well as assisting with penalty and interest disputes. 
Paycom Pay. Our Paycom pay application eliminates the tedious, risky job of check reconciliation by issuing checks to our clients’ employees that clear from a Paycom bank account, which helps clients eliminate potential liability and simplifies the reconciliation process. This helps reduce the number of transaction on a client’s general ledger and simplifies bank statement balancing. 
Expense Management. Our expense management application eliminates the manual, paper-based processes associated with employee expense reimbursement and allows employers to control and monitor expenses by setting clearly defined rules and parameters for employee reimbursement. Employees can upload receipts when submitting their expenses and access an expense dashboard where they can view the status of their submitted expenses through Employee Self-Service. Organizations gain audit-ready reporting, which is critical when a client needs to know who approved or denied a request, when and more. 
Mileage Tracker/FAVR. Our native mobile app includes mileage tracker capability, allowing employers to more accurately track, log and manage employees’ mileage reimbursements that are then automatically updated within our expense management applications. FAVR, which stands for Fixed and Variable Rate, allows our clients to customize their mileage reimbursement rate, according to IRS guidelines, to ensure accurate employee reimbursement for business miles without overpaying on reimbursements. 
Garnishment Management. Our garnishment management application mitigates the risk of penalties and lawsuits from employees and agencies, allowing clients to handle communications with garnishment payees and agencies and to calculate and track garnishment payments. 
GL Concierge. Our GL concierge application offers organizations more control and transparency into their payroll general ledger and gives finance professionals intuitive reporting, enriched audit trails, customizable file layouts and real-time alerts. Clients of all sizes can utilize a wide variety of general ledger maps along with an action-item alert system that improves the dynamics of their daily operations. With this simplified process, accounting departments can generate mapped GL reports for direct import into various accounting software packages. 

Talent Management
 
 
Employee Self-Service. Available in English or Spanish, our employee self-service application improves employee engagement by empowering employees to self-manage certain transactions, obtain quick answers to frequent payroll and HR questions, access their pay history, view performance goals and reviews and view total compensation reports that show their compensation and benefits package. Benefits information and paid time-off accruals also give employees the ability to make informed decisions regarding their benefit selections and time-off requests. Employees can access our self-service software through any device with an internet connection or by downloading the Paycom app on the Google Play™ store and the App Store® online store.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compensation Budgeting. Our compensation budgeting application provides compensation and performance information in one system, providing clients valuable workforce insight to help manage and formulate salary budgets and establish merit-based compensation increases that automatically upload new rates to payroll once the merit increases are set. Having payroll linked with performance reviews is instrumental for compensation budgeting, which rewards employees fairly while staying within budget. 
Performance Management. Our performance management application allows employees to set standardized pay grades and performance goals for positions across an organization, helping align company goals with workforce goals. It also helps streamline the performance review process with online facilitation of the review process and links performance to pay.

My Analytics. The my analytics application offers powerful workforce insight in a variety of report formats. Because we offer an all-in-one solution in a single-database, the comprehensive report data provides the workforce intelligence needed to drive human capital decisions at all levels of management. As part of the my analytics application, we offer employment predictor reporting. This sophisticated machine learning technology gives an employer greater insight into employees at risk of leaving its organization. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paycom Learning and Course Content. Our learning management application formalizes and standardizes our clients’ training processes. Employers can create customized content utilizing videos, presentations, quizzes and surveys. It provides employees with “anytime, anywhere” access to a central knowledge base where the employee can access content, share expertise and measure his or her professional development progress. Employers gain comprehensive reporting insights by running custom or predefined reports, including pass versus. fail and quiz statistics. In addition to providing the ability to create and upload custom content, we created and launched our own proprietary eLearning content. Paycom Learning clients have immediate access to a library of Paycom-created learning courses, which allow employers to educate their managers and employees quickly and consistently on foundational topics such as workplace violence, discrimination and harassment prevention. 

 HR Management
 
 
Document and Checklist. Our document and checklist application is designed to manage employee files and allows employees to digitally sign and view company documents. We securely store client records to meet retention requirements and protect documents from unauthorized access and other disasters that can threaten businesses. Aside from expending fewer resources on paper, printing and file storage, our document and checklist application protects sensitive information and documents by customizing user access levels. In addition, clients can assign checklists to employees for the completion of certain tasks associated with processes such as on-boarding and off-boarding. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Government and Compliance. Our government and compliance application helps clients reduce exposure to violations, audits and penalties with respect to the employment laws impacting their business, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, COBRA and other state and federal regulations. A single-database keeps our clients’ employee data consistent and enhances reporting capabilities by providing better accuracy and real-time insight. 
Benefits Administration/Benefits to Carrier. Our benefits administration application allows clients to customize benefit plan setup, deduction amounts, enrollment dates and new-hire waiting periods. Employers are provided census and reconciliation reports to ensure they do not overpay for benefits. Employers can also update deduction amounts for all employees or groups of employees at once and automatically updates all insurance carriers for any changes. This application also provides employees with online enrollment and helps educate them by allowing them to view per-pay-period deduction amounts and preview how these deductions would affect their take-home pay, driving better informed enrollment decisions for greater employee satisfaction. Our benefits to carrier application automatically updates insurance carriers regarding benefit deduction amounts, address changes, termination of benefits and qualifying events. 
COBRA Administration. Our COBRA administration application helps protect employers from COBRA violations and the associated fines and penalties by automatically initiating compliance measures upon entry of qualifying events into the application. In addition to sending required correspondence, this application also tracks important dates, collects and remits premiums and reports on all COBRA activity. 
Personnel Action Forms. Our personnel action forms application helps our clients reduce the amount of time and paperwork required to make employee changes, such as pay rate, position and title changes, by allowing managers to complete and approve online personnel action forms, subject to necessary approvals from the HR department. This feature reduces errors and eliminates re-keying of data and even feeds to payroll with an effective date. 
Surveys. Our surveys application allows employers to conduct confidential email surveys of employees on workplace matters, providing employers with candid feedback that otherwise may go undisclosed. From exit interviews and benefits assessments to rate-the-boss questionnaires, this valuable information can be used to drive decisions and realize company goals. Clients can analyze results by the demographics of the workforce and compare how results change over time. 

 7



 
Enhanced ACA. Our Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) application provides clients with access to a dashboard that tracks employee count, employee status, health care plan affordability and ACA periods all from one convenient location and enables Paycom to file IRS Forms 1094/1095-B and/or –C. Clients utilizing this application also have access to additional real-time compliance reports, alerts and historical data for audit trail purposes. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Clients
 We serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. We have over 23,500 clients, or approximately 12,700 clients based on parent company grouping, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We stored data for over 4.1 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Many small to mid-sized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies, which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days. As a result of the nature and size of our clientele, we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients. We believe, however, that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost.  As we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range, we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. 
 Competition
 The market for HCM solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to changing technology, shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from small, regional firms to large, well-established international firms with multiple product offerings.
 We compete with firms that provide HCM solutions by various means. Many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software, but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows, we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of HCM cloud-based solutions by other SaaS providers. Our competitors offer HCM solutions that may overlap with one, several or all categories of applications offered by our solution. Our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and Workday, Inc. Our payroll applications, including payroll processing, compete primarily with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”), Ceridian HCM, Inc. (“Ceridian”), Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our HR management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Oracle Corporation, Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation, SAP SE and Workday, Inc.   Our time and labor management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Kronos Incorporated, Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our larger competitors compete with us across multiple segments. In addition, our HCM solution continues to face competition from in-house payroll and HR systems and departments as well as HR systems and software sold by third-party vendors.
 Competition in the HCM solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, breadth of service, application offering and price. The importance of these factors depends on the size of the business. Price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees, while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses. Regardless of a company’s size, another important factor is the implementation experience, as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process.  
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force, substantially all of whom have a four-year college degree. We typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in non-HCM industries or, with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities, who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales.  Our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel, who are organized geographically, and client relations representatives (“CRRs”), who sell additional applications to existing clients. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, we have 49 sales teams located in 26 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the U.S. market.
 We provide our sales force with an intensive eight-week training course that includes at least one week of training at our headquarters in Oklahoma City. Our unique training program includes instruction in accounting, business metrics, application features and tax matters relevant to our target market and we believe it fosters loyalty and helps maintain our corporate culture. Our training continues for our sales force through weekly in-office strategy sessions and leadership development training. Executive sales representatives are also required to attend in-person quarterly conferences to share best practices and receive legal and business updates.
 When a new client processes payroll with us for an entire month, our sales representative receives a one-time commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client. When an existing client purchases and then utilizes a new application for one payroll cycle, a CRR receives a one-time commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such 
 8



client.  Executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and base salary based upon both current year and life-to-date realized sales.
 We generate client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target senior finance and HR executives, technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform HCM functions in-house or outsource these functions to one of our competitors. Our marketing programs include:
  
• | Podcasts, webinars, blogs, white papers and infographics;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | National and local television advertising campaigns, personalized direct mail campaigns, email campaigns, social and digital media campaigns, industry-specific advertising and tradeshow exhibiting; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Search engine marketing methods that include site optimization and pay-per-click searches.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to managing client relationships, our CRRs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications. Our CRRs call upon select clients periodically and are paid a non-recurring commission on any additional sales they generate.
 Technology, Operations and Security
 Technology
 Our multi-tenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution, while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data. Because a single version of our solution is developed, supported and deployed across all of our clients, updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time, making it easier to scale our solution as our number of clients and their respective employee headcounts increase.
 We maintain multiple load-balanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data. We back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication, snapshots and cold archive methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly. Our server cluster and database servers have redundant “hot swappable” disks to ensure continuous service in the event of a disk failure.
 Operations
 We physically host our solution for our clients in three secure data center facilities located in Oklahoma and Texas. All of our critical systems are fully redundant and backed-up in real-time to these facilities. Physical security includes ID-oriented access control, alarm systems and manned 24-hour-a-day camera monitoring by our security guards. Server facilities also have environmental monitoring and extensive environmental controls such as heat and fire protection, moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors, backup power supply and exterior reinforced concrete walls.
Security
 We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our clients’ data. During the regular course of business, we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process, record and store following ISO/IEC 270001:2013 certified controls and procedures. All communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow high-grade encryption algorithms.
 We strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities. Local network access is restricted by our authenticated server, using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall, which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network. We also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure, systems that monitor that infrastructure and alert our security department of cybersecurity issues, a system for managing and installing patches for unsecure third-party applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data. Our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we retain a third-party penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues.
 Our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices. Our IT infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network. This security is also continually monitored by our information security department.  All of our operations employees work in either our Oklahoma or Texas locations and, with the exception of certain IT personnel, are not permitted to work remotely.
 Software Development
 Our application development team works closely with our clients to enhance our existing application offerings and develop new applications. This process is led by experienced product managers who oversee the evolution of their respective applications within a

focused timeframe of innovation and cultivation in order to deliver the well-developed applications and enhancements desired by our clients. Our product managers, many of whom are former HR executives, are proactive in their approach to assigning development requests based on research, trends and user feedback. A key element of our development process is the one-on-one personal interaction between clients and our CRRs, through whom our clients personally suggest new applications and features.
 We develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams. Our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive new applications and enhancements, review requests, schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements. Our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team, in accordance with our software development process, before being fully implemented. Any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients.
 Capitalized software development expenses, which include compensation for employees directly associated with development projects, were $22.0 million, $15.8 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Client Service
 We are committed to providing industry-leading, client-centered service. For this reason, we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team. This one-on-one service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure we are delivering an industry-leading solution and maintaining high client satisfaction. The primary elements of our client service model include the following:
 Streamlined Setup and On-Boarding
 After electing to deploy our solution, a new client begins our on-boarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales representative responsible for obtaining the client’s business. In addition, we also have a team of transition specialists whose job it is to ensure that the process is performed smoothly, data is collected properly and all relevant employees are fully trained on the system. This team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution independently, at which time responsibility for the client relationship is transferred to our dedicated CRRs and service specialists. Unlike certain of our competitors, we do not outsource any of our on-boarding efforts.
 Dedicated Service Specialists
 After completing the on-boarding process, each client is assigned to a services specialist within a dedicated team.  Clients can then contact their dedicated services specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise. These specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs. When appropriate, client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application, regulatory or tax expertise. In addition, our CRRs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications.
Expert Level Service
 Our client specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive, expert-level service. Our client service is ISO 9001:2015 certified and helps support our high client retention rate.
Regulatory and Certifications
 We are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions. These regulations and laws cover, among others, information privacy.
 Data privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in other countries. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include, for example, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the ACA and state breach notification laws.  Further, because some of our clients have establishments in the European Union, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) may impact our processing of certain client and employee information.
 We voluntarily obtain third-party security examinations relating to our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with System and Organization Controls Report, I (“SOC 1”).  Our SOC 1 examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms, and addresses, among other areas, our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and integrity procedures, change management procedures and logical security procedures.

In October 2016, we renewed a certification based on ISO/IEC 27001:2013 criteria, a security standard for Information Security Management Systems published by ISO covering our production, quality assurance and implementation environments. This independent assessment of our conformity to the ISO 27001 standard includes assessing security risks, designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis. The certification is valid until December 2019, with continuing assessments taking place annually.
 In April 2017, we renewed a certification based on ISO 9001:2015 criteria, a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by ISO, covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution. This independent assessment of our conformity to the ISO 9001:2015 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis. The certification is valid until April 2020, with continuing assessments taking place annually. 
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We do not have any patents or patent applications pending.
Seasonality
 Our revenues are seasonal in nature. Recurring revenues include revenues related to the annual processing of payroll forms, such as Form W-2 and Form 1099, and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. Because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year, first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters. Further, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we began generating additional revenues as a result of the enactment of the ACA, as many clients began complying with filing requirements for Forms 1094 and 1095.  We anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to ACA form filings for so long as the ACA (or replacement legislation) includes employer reporting requirements.  In addition, we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year. Therefore, we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our non-payroll applications.
Employees
 Our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success. We invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 3,050 people, substantially all of which are full-time. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters is an approximately 500,000-square-foot campus located on over 30 acres of Company-owned property in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In addition to housing two fully redundant data centers at our corporate headquarters, we operate another fully redundant data center at a leased property near Dallas, Texas. We plan to relocate our Texas operations, including the data center, to a new, expanded facility in Grapevine, Texas.  We also lease a disaster recovery site in downtown Oklahoma City. 
 We also lease offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. We believe that these facilities are suitable for our current operations and upon the expiration of the terms of the leases we believe we could renew these leases or find suitable space elsewhere on acceptable terms.
 Segment Information
 We operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function (which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level. Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements.
