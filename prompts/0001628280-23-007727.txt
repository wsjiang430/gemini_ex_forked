Item 1. Business.
THE COMPANY
Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Cumberland,” the “Company,” or as used in the context of “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of branded prescription pharmaceutical products. We are dedicated to providing innovative products that improve the quality of care for patients and address poorly met medical needs.
Our primary target markets are hospital acute care, gastroenterology and oncology. These medical specialties are characterized by relatively concentrated prescriber bases that we believe can be served effectively by small, targeted sales forces. We promote our approved products through our hospital, field and oncology sales divisions in the United States while we continue to build a network of international partners to register and provide our medicines to patients in their countries. 
Our portfolio of brands approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) includes:
•Acetadote® (acetylcysteine) injection, for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning; 
•Caldolor® (ibuprofen) injection, for the treatment of pain and fever;
•Kristalose® (lactulose) for oral solution, a prescription laxative, for the treatment of constipation;
•Omeclamox-Pak®, (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin) oral, for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and related duodenal ulcer disease;
•RediTrex® (methotrexate) injection, for the treatment of active rheumatoid, juvenile idiopathic and severe psoriatic arthritis, as well as disabling psoriasis;
•Sancuso® (granisetron) transdermal, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy treatment;
•Vaprisol® (conivaptan) injection, to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia; and
•Vibativ® (telavancin) injection, for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, as well as complicated skin and skin structure infections.
In addition to these commercial brands, we have Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating our ifetroban product candidate for patients with cardiomyopathy associated with 1) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”), a fatal, genetic neuromuscular disease, 2) Systemic Sclerosis (“SSc”) or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and 3) Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (“AERD”), a severe form of asthma.
Cumberland has built core competencies for the acquisition, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. – and we believe we can leverage this existing infrastructure to support our continued growth. Our management team consists of pharmaceutical industry veterans with experience in business development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and finance.
Our business development team identifies, evaluates, and negotiates product acquisition, licensing and co- promotion agreements. Our product development team creates proprietary formulations, manages our clinical studies, prepares our FDA submissions and staffs our medical call center. Our quality and manufacturing professionals oversee the manufacturing, release and shipment of our products. Our marketing and sales organization is responsible for our commercial activities, and we work closely with our distribution partners to ensure the availability and delivery of our products.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In early 2020, the U.S. declared a health care emergency following the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a novel strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The Company managed through the resulting pandemic, continuing to operate our business – keeping facilities open and our organization intact. We moved quickly to ensure the health and safety of our team. We also maintained our ongoing compliance with the many laws and regulations that apply to us as a publicly traded pharmaceutical company.
Throughout the pandemic, Cumberland faced the same challenges affecting other companies that rely on hospital admissions and patient visits to drive revenue. Our clinical studies were also impacted, as fewer patients sought elective surgeries and our access to medical facilities was substantially limited. We carefully monitored our supply chain, including the flow of raw materials and the batches of finished products emerging from the facilities that manufacture our products.
We welcomed a return to a more typical operating environment as 2022 progressed, following the economic and societal effects of the pandemic. We were encouraged to see enrollment in our clinical trials resume, patient procedures return to more customary levels and access for our sales representatives improve as they gained more face-to-face meetings with medical professionals.
In 2022, we continued to expand our product portfolio, starting the year with the announcement of our Sancuso acquisition from the U.S. affiliate of Japan-based Kyowa Kirin. With significant contributions from Sancuso, we experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth.
Throughout the year we continued our mission, delivering our products to improve patient care, while also addressing the interests of our shareholders, employees, partners and community.
New Headquarters
In late October 2022, we opened our new headquarter offices at the Broadwest campus in the Vanderbilt/West End corridor of Nashville. Our move into the new state-of-the-art facilities will enable the Company to accommodate our growth, support our team, and better serve our international base of customers and partners. 
Sustainability Report
In August 2022, we released our second annual Sustainability Report (the “2021 Sustainability Report”), which detailed Cumberland’s activities pertaining to our environmental, social and governance matters. We issued our inaugural Sustainability Report in 2019 and remain committed to sustainability and to maintaining transparency of our corporate operations. As the largest biopharmaceutical company founded and headquartered in the Mid-South, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethical practices and understand the importance of recognizing and addressing our impact on our constituents, the community and the environment.
The 2021 Sustainability Report noted that during that year we provided nearly 2.5 million patient doses of our products, safely disposed of over 6,000 pounds of expired and damaged products and had no product recalls. We also had no Company brands listed on the FDA’s MedWatch Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products, no Company product issues identified by the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System and no clinical trials terminated due to failure to practice good clinical standards.
The 2021 Sustainability Report also highlighted our investment in our employees through our continuing education programs, employee development initiatives and employee recognition awards. We reported that women represented 44% of Cumberland’s workforce and 15% of our employees were minorities.
Through our sustainability initiatives, we will continue to identify and address critical industry issues, monitor relevant guidelines and utilize best practices.
Cybersecurity
The Company has taken appropriate steps to monitor an adequate level of cybersecurity. The Company is insured against cyber attacks and has appropriate detection and mitigation controls in place.

Acetadote®
Acetadote is an intravenous formulation of N-acetylcysteine, indicated for the treatment of liver toxicity associated with acetaminophen poisoning. Cumberland developed and obtained U.S. FDA approval for Acetadote, and then introduced the product through our hospital sales force. 
Acetadote is typically used in hospital emergency departments to prevent or lessen potential liver damage resulting from an overdose of acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription pain relieving and fever-reducing products. Acetaminophen overdose continues to be a leading cause of poisonings reported by hospital emergency departments in the U.S., and Acetadote has become a standard of care for treating this potentially life-threatening condition.
Acetadote received U.S. FDA approval as an orphan drug, which provided seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of approval. That exclusivity has since expired.
In connection with the FDA’s approval of Acetadote, we committed to certain post-marketing activities for the product. Completion of our first Phase IV commitment resulted in the FDA’s approval of expanded labeling for the product for use in pediatric patients. Completion of our second Phase IV commitment resulted in further revised labeling for the product with FDA approval of additional safety data.
Completion of our third and final Phase IV commitment culminated in the FDA’s approval of a new formulation for the product. The next generation formulation contains no ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (“EDTA”) or other stabilization agent, chelating agent or preservative. Cumberland introduced this new Acetadote formulation replacing the original form of the product which we no longer manufacture.
The FDA subsequently approved updated labeling for Acetadote revising the product’s indication and providing new dosing guidance for specific patient populations. As a result, dosing guidance is now included for patients weighing over 100 kg, and new language was added to alert health care providers that, in certain clinical situations, therapy should be extended for some patients.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) issued us a series of patents associated with our Acetadote product. These patents are discussed in Part I, Item I – “Business - Trademarks and Patents” – of this Form 10-K. The FDA has approved several abbreviated new drug applications (“ANDA”) filed by various generics companies referencing Acetadote. Those products all possess the old formulation containing EDTA.
We entered into an agreement with Perrigo Company resulting in the distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection (our “Authorized Generic”) product. Both Acetadote and our Authorized Generic utilize the new, EDTA-free formulation.
An Illinois judge issued a final ruling in favor of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a patent case associated with Acetadote. By ruling in Cumberland’s favor, the court upheld the validity of the patent that encompasses our EDTA-free formulation. The court also granted a permanent injunction preventing challengers from marketing a generic version of our proprietary Acetadote product formulation before the expiration of Cumberland’s patent in August 2025. An Appeals Court affirmed the District Court ruling in the Company's favor upholding Cumberland's Acetadote patent and expressly rejected the validity challenge.
During 2022, we continued to distribute our Acetadote brand, however our Authorized Generic product is now distributed through Padagis US LLC (formerly a division of Perrigo Company).
Caldolor®
Caldolor, our intravenous formulation of ibuprofen, was the first injectable product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of both pain and fever. We conducted a series of clinical studies in over 900 adult patients to develop the data to support our FDA submission for the product's registration. Following a priority review, the FDA approved Caldolor for marketing in the U.S.
A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (“NSAID”), the product was indicated for use in adults as a sole treatment for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics. It was also the first FDA approved intravenous therapy for treating fever.
We then launched Caldolor and continue to promote the product in the U.S. through our hospital sales force.
We completed a series of Phase IV studies to gather additional data to support our Caldolor product. Those clinical trials involved another 1,000 adult and pediatric patients. These studies included data on a shortened infusion time and pre-surgical administration of the product. To address our Phase IV commitment to the FDA, these studies also included evaluation of the product for the reduction of fever in hospitalized children and the treatment of pain in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgeries.
We then received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for use in children. We subsequently initiated a study to collect data on the use of Caldolor in children ranging in age from birth up to 6 months of age. Enrollment in that study was completed in 2019.
In early 2018, we completed and filed the application for FDA approval of a next generation Caldolor product featuring an improved presentation and formulation which was approved in January 2019. The new, premixed presentation provides healthcare professionals a formulation that is easy to administer, helping manage the treatment of patient pain and fever, while reducing opioid consumption. It is provided in a pre-mixed bag containing 800 mg of ibuprofen in a 200 mL patented low sodium formulation for injection that is ready to use. It is the first and only 
FDA-approved pre-mixed bag of ibuprofen. Caldolor is still available as an 800 mg/8mL single–dose vial for dilution in addition to the ready-to-use bag. 
In January 2020, we initiated a full-scale launch of this ready-to-use product. Unfortunately, the launch was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting postponement of elective surgeries. 
In November 2021, the FDA approved our submission to expand the labeling for Caldolor to include administration of the product prior to surgery. During our clinical studies we found that the product delivered its best results when dosed prior to surgery, reducing both patient pain as well as their need for opiates. 
During 2022, we distributed both the vial and the ready-to-use premixed bag presentations of Caldolor. We also announced an agreement with PiSA Pharmaceutical for the registration and commercialization of Caldolor in Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Cumberland will be responsible for providing the product dossier and supplies. PiSA will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the product in Mexico and introducing it to the new market. PiSA expects to provide the product in both 400- and 800-milligram vials.
Kristalose®
Kristalose is a prescription laxative administered orally for the treatment of acute and chronic constipation. An innovative, dry powder crystalline formulation of lactulose, Kristalose is designed to enhance patient acceptance and compliance. It is the only prescription laxative available in pre-measured powder packets.
Kristalose dissolves easily in 4 ounces of water, offering patients a virtually taste-free, grit-free and essentially calorie-free alternative to lactulose syrups. We conducted a preference study which indicated that 77% of patients surveyed prefer the taste, consistency and portability of Kristalose over similar products in syrup forms.
We acquired the assets and exclusive rights to Kristalose through a series of transactions, then assembled a dedicated field sales force which re-launched the product as a Cumberland brand. We directed our sales efforts to physicians who are the most prolific writers of prescription laxatives, including gastroenterologists and internists. We supplemented this personal promotion with telemarketing campaigns to expand our reach and support of the product. Using preference data as a cornerstone of our marketing efforts, we repositioned the brand, enhancing patient affordability through a coupon program and expanded managed care coverage for the product.
We added a co-promotion partner, Poly Pharmaceuticals, who is promoting Kristalose to physician targets not covered by our field sales forces. We then added another partner, Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc., who is repackaging Kristalose and featuring it with additional new physician targets.
During 2022, we continued to support Kristalose through our field sales force as well as our partnerships with Poly Pharmaceuticals and Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
The Kristalose award-winning marketing campaign was refreshed for 2022 to support increased engagement with our customers. We also expanded patient support for the brand and it was added to the GoodRx platform during the year.
Omeclamox-Pak®
Many ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract are caused by an infection from the Helicobacter pylori (“H. pylori”) bacterium. Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of these infections and the related duodenal ulcer disease. This innovative product combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin.
Omeclamox-Pak was the first FDA-approved triple therapy combination medication to contain omeprazole as the proton pump inhibitor, which works to decrease the amount of acid the stomach produces. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are both antibiotic agents that hinder the growth of the H. pylori bacteria. Interaction of these agents allows the stomach lining to heal effectively. The medications are packaged together on convenient daily dosing cards, making it simple to follow the twice a day dosing before meals.
We acquired the assets and exclusive rights to Omeclamox-Pak through a series of transactions and re-launched the product as a Cumberland brand supported by our field sales force.
The packager for Omeclamox-Pak encountered financial difficulties due to the impact of COVID-19. They are under new management and are in the process of a reorganization. Discussions with the packager are ongoing.
RediTrex®
We entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement to register and commercialize a methotrexate product line in the United States. RediTrex is a line of pre-filled syringes specifically designed for ease of handling and dosing accuracy for the subcutaneous administration of methotrexate in patients with arthritis and psoriasis.
RediTrex treats patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who have difficulty tolerating or responding to orally delivered methotrexate. It is also approved for symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis in adults who are not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy.
With more than 54 million Americans living with some form of arthritis, the disease is among the most common causes of work disability in the U.S., according to the CDC. The oral form of methotrexate is typically the first line of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. As the disease progresses, the dose must be increased to stay effective, often causing intolerable gastrointestinal side effects.
Injectable methotrexate has been proven to be more effective than oral delivery, with fewer gastrointestinal reactions. Because of the increased efficacy and tolerability, injectable methotrexate can delay the need to move to costly biologics, lowering overall patient treatment costs. Once disease progression requires the use of biologics, continuing the treatment of injectable methotrexate along with the biologic has been shown to increase overall efficacy.
Other injectable methotrexate options available may not optimally meet the needs of arthritis patients who are offered either a vial and syringe for self-injection, or the use of an expensive autoinjector. The vial and syringe method can be difficult for a patient to handle due to limited dexterity in their hands. Additionally, obtaining the exact dose needed while preventing skin exposure to the caustic methotrexate can be quite challenging for many patients. The autoinjectors provide a better alternative to the vial and syringe, but they remove injection control from the patient and can be painful to administer. They are also the most expensive methotrexate delivery.
In December 2019, we received FDA approval for RediTrex and began planning for a launch of the product line. In late 2020, we received initial product supplies and then provided shipments of RediTrex to select accounts. Due to the pandemic, we delayed the national launch of the product, which was then implemented during the fourth quarter of 2021.
During 2022, we entered into two amendments to our agreement with Nordic Pharma, who had provided us with a license for the U.S. rights associated with our RediTrex line. Pursuant to these amendments, in exchange for financial consideration, Nordic may assume responsibility for distributing the methotrexate products in the U.S. after June 30, 2023.
Sancuso®
At the end of 2021, we entered into an agreement with Kyowa Kirin to acquire the U.S. assets and rights to Sancuso® (granisetron transdermal system), an FDA-approved oncology supportive care medicine. This transaction closed in January 2022.
Sancuso is the first and only FDA-approved prescription patch for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy treatment for their cancer. The active drug in Sancuso, granisetron, slowly dissolves in the thin layer of adhesive that sticks to the patient’s skin and is released into their bloodstream over several days, working continuously to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). It is applied 24 to 48 hours before receiving chemotherapy and can prevent CINV for up to five consecutive days. Alternative oral treatments must be taken several times (day and night) to deliver the same therapeutic doses.
In early 2022, we assumed full commercial responsibility for the product in the U.S. – including its marketing, promotion, distribution, manufacturing, and medical support activities. Kyowa Kirin retained international rights, continuing to deliver the product to address oncology patients’ needs throughout the rest of the world. In January 2022, we began shipments of the product and formed a new sales force, Cumberland Oncology, to support the brand. During this past year, we completed the transition of Sancuso from Kyowa Kirin to Cumberland. We have already seen Sancuso quickly become one of our most important brands and a significant contributor to our business.
Vaprisol®
We acquired the assets and rights to Vaprisol, a prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment.
Hyponatremia, an imbalance of serum sodium to body water, is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. These electrolyte disturbances occur when the sodium ion concentration in the plasma is lower than normal and are often associated with a variety of critical care conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia. Vaprisol raises serum sodium to appropriate levels and promotes free water secretion. Our Vaprisol product is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment. It has a proven day-one response rate to normalize serum sodium levels in hyponatremic patients and move them out of the Intensive Care Unit as efficiently as possible.
Vaprisol is supported by our hospital sales division. Demand for the product increased in 2020 during the pandemic, and we worked to support the expanded use of the product in hospitals and clinics during the health care crisis. During 2021, we shipped all remaining inventory of the product and have notified the FDA that supplies of the product are not currently available. We have since transferred manufacturing of the product to a new manufacturing facility. Our new manufacturing partner is working with the FDA to address several Form 483 and warning letter issues in a timely manner. Meanwhile, we are working with them to support a special, interim supply of compounded product for critically ill patients, while awaiting the needed facility approval to relaunch Vaprisol.
Vibativ®
In November 2018, the Company announced an agreement to acquire the Vibativ assets and assume global responsibility for the brand including the related marketing, distribution, manufacturing and regulatory activities. In early 2021, we introduced the Cumberland-packaged product, which is supported by our hospital sales force.
Vibativ is a patented, FDA-approved injectable anti-infective. It is designed to treat serious infections due to Staphylococcus aureus (“S. Aureus") and other Gram-positive bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”) and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (“MSSA”). Vibativ addresses a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including those that are considered difficult-to-treat and multidrug-resistant.
Vibativ can serve as a potentially life-saving treatment in patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia resulting from infections including the flu, RSV and COVID-19.
Pneumonia caused by secondary bacterial infections is common among patients with viral respiratory infections. The risk of such infections grows as hospitals see more patients with respiratory symptoms due to COVID-19. Research shows that hospital-acquired pneumonia (“HAP”) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (“VAP”) have historically accounted for 22% of common hospital-acquired infections. Methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (“MSSA” and “MRSA”) are important disease-causing pathogens in these cases.
While many recently introduced antibiotics are quickly losing the battle to fight the bacteria they were designed to kill because those bacteria have become drug-resistant, Vibativ was specifically designed to kill drug-resistant bacteria. 
The molecule of an existing antibiotic to which bacteria had developed a resistance, vancomycin, was altered by adding a lipophilic (fat-loving) component and a hydrophilic (water-loving) component. The lipophilic addition 
increases Vibativ’s ability to penetrate the cell wall and inhibits the formation of new cell walls (the development of new and/or additional cell walls is the most common way that bacteria become resistant to drugs). The hydrophilic addition increases Vibativ’s penetration into tissue – so it is able to attack infections that are not reachable by other antibiotics. In comparison to vancomycin, Vibativ is 32 times more potent against MRSA strains when tested under in vitro conditions. Further, in clinical trials, Vibativ demonstrated superior cure rates of patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
While we remain focused on promoting Vibativ in the U.S. market, we are building a network of other established companies to bring Vibativ to patients in their countries and territories. In March 2022, we announced the launch of Vibativ in Puerto Rico through a partnership with Verity Pharmaceuticals, who has a particular strength and experience in that market. Also in March 2022, we announced a new partnership with Saudi Arabia-based Tabuk Pharmaceutical to introduce Vibativ into the Middle East. The arrangement provides Tabuk exclusive rights to distribute Vibativ in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, with the option to expand into other countries in the region.
Meanwhile, our Vibativ partner for the Chinese market, SciClone Pharmaceuticals, had their approval application in China accepted for review in September 2021. We have since been supporting SciClone and their requests associated with review of that submission. They are working toward the approval and SciClone believes that there is significant potential for Vibativ in their country.
PIPELINE
Ifetroban Clinical Studies
Ifetroban is a selective thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (“TPr”) antagonist dosed in nearly 1,400 subjects and found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and various patient populations. We are currently sponsoring a series of Phase II clinical programs to evaluate our ifetroban product candidates in 1) Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, a severe form of asthma, 2) Systemic Sclerosis or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and 3) patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a genetic neuromuscular disease that results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart and lung muscles.
Enrollment in our clinical studies was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many of our clinical study sites have reopened and resumed screening of patients for potential participation into our studies during 2022. We also closed unproductive sites and opened qualified replacements during the year. We are awaiting results from the studies underway before deciding on the best development path for the registration of ifetroban, our first new chemical entity.
Following is more information about the clinical programs in which we are evaluating ifetroban:
Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (“AERD”)
We have completed the manufacturing and initiated clinical development of an oral formulation of ifetroban under the brand name Boxaban®. We are evaluating this candidate for patients suffering from Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (“AERD”), also known as Samter’s Triad, a chronic medical condition that consists of three clinical features: asthma, sinus disease with nasal polyposis and sensitivity to aspirin. AERD is characterized by sharp increases in inflammatory mediators and platelet activity within the respiratory system. Approximately one in 20 asthmatic adults in the U.S. suffer from AERD and awareness of the disease is growing within the medical community. There is no U.S. approved pharmaceutical treatment for AERD.
Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital have completed an investigator-initiated study evaluating the impact of ifetroban on the aspirin desensitization process in patients with AERD. This single center study closed early due to poor patient accrual and exhausted funding. The researchers found no statistical difference in the dose of aspirin needed to provide an increase in an extended version of the patient’s total nasal symptom score. The researchers are pursuing a publication of the full study results. It should be noted that the results from this investigator study were inconsistent with the previously published preclinical findings that demonstrated ifetroban blockade inhibited all features of aspirin reactions in a model of AERD. It also differs in design from our corporate-sponsored AERD studies.
We completed an initial Phase II clinical study at several U.S. medical centers led by the Scripps Research Institute entitled, A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Determine the Safety of Oral Ifetroban in Patients with a History of AERD. That study randomized 16 subjects 3:1 (ifetroban: placebo), demonstrated no safety concerns and provided several signals of efficacy. A follow-on phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of oral ifetroban entitled, A Phase 2 Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo- Controlled Trial to Evaluate Oral Ifetroban in Subjects with Symptomatic Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (“AERD”), was then initiated. The patient enrollment in that study is now closed, and we are awaiting the completion of the data analysis and availability of top line study results.
Systemic Sclerosis (“SSc”)
We have also initiated the clinical development of ifetroban oral capsules under the brand name Vasculan® for the treatment of Systemic sclerosis, also called scleroderma. It’s a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, including the heart, as well as vascular dysfunction. SSc has a high morbidity and the highest case-specific mortality of any rheumatic disorder, with 50% of patients dying or developing major internal organ complications within three years of diagnosis. Although several medications are used to treat the skin disease associated with SSc, there is no universally effective treatment to improve the function of affected internal organs including the cardiovascular system.
Cardiac involvement associated with SSc is often underestimated due to its subtle and atypical presentation. Despite the cardiovascular events associated with its elevated mortality at later stages of the disease, overt signs are suggestive of advance disease including myocardial or pericardial inflammation, heart failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”). 
Our Vanderbilt collaborators completed preclinical studies demonstrating TPr blockade with ifetroban prevents cardiac fibrosis and can restore cardiac function in animal models of PAH.
The FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug (IND) application to evaluate 12 months of oral ifetroban (Vasculan) in a 34-subject phase II trial entitled, A Phase II Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Ifetroban in Patients with Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis or Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Enrollment in this study is well underway and includes patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, as well as those with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with their SSc.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”)
We also initiated the clinical development of oral ifetroban under the brand name Dyscorban® for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”), a rare and fatal disease caused by a genetic defect which leads to inexorable muscle damage. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in DMD patients. TPr and its ligand, isoprostanes, are found to have increased in DMD patients.
Preclinical studies by our Vanderbilt collaborators demonstrated TPr blockade by ifetroban prevented cardiac dysfunction and improved mortality in several animal models of muscular dystrophy. These results, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, suggest TPr activation contributes to DMD cardiomyopathy and blockade with ifetroban may serve as a novel therapeutic for DMD patients.
The FDA cleared Cumberland’s IND application to evaluate 12 months of oral ifetroban (Dyscorban) in a Phase II study entitled, A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multiple Dose Study with an Open-Label Extension to Determine the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Oral Ifetroban in Subjects with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. With medical centers across the U.S. screening patients, our clinical study is enrolling those with 48 ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD, 7 years of age and older with stable cardiac function.
Cumberland was awarded just over $1 million in federal funding to support this clinical trial, which is the first DMD clinical study awarded FDA Orphan Product Development funding. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its global impact on clinical research in 2020, the FDA awarded a supplemental grant in support of our Phase II DMD study. During 2022, patient enrollment in this DMD study continued.
Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases
In September 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new clinical program for the use of ifetroban to treat Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases (“PF-ILDs”). Nonclinical studies are complete, and the resulting manuscript was prepared and submitted for publication in 2021. A Phase II clinical study is planned and an application to the FDA is in preparation to support this new clinical program.
Other Ifetroban Programs
We have also completed Phase II clinical programs with ifetroban in patients with Hepatorenal Syndrome (“HRS”) and patients with Portal Hypertension (“PH”). Additional preclinical and pilot clinical studies of ifetroban are underway, including several investigator-initiated trials. 
Our plan going forward is to complete each of our Company-sponsored studies, analyze their final data, announce top-line results and decide on the best development path for the registration of ifetroban, which we continue to believe has the potential to benefit many patients with orphan diseases that represent unmet medical needs.
New Hospital Product Candidate
Cumberland was responsible for the formulation, development and FDA approval of both Acetadote and Caldolor. Our Medical Advisory Board has helped us identify additional opportunities that address unmet or poorly met medical needs. As a result, Cumberland has successfully designed, formulated and completed the preclinical studies for a cholesterol-reducing agent for use in the hospital setting. 
We have completed a Phase I study which defined the pharmacokinetic properties and provided a favorable safety profile for this new product candidate. The study results and a proposed clinical development plan were discussed with the FDA. A Phase II study has been initiated and patient enrollment is complete. We have also completed the clinical study report, filed it with the FDA and continue to consider any next steps for this program. 
GROWTH STRATEGY
Cumberland’s growth strategy involves maximizing the potential of our existing brands while continuing to build a portfolio of differentiated products. We currently feature eight products approved by the FDA in the United States. We are also continuing to explore international partnerships to bring our medicines to patients in other countries. Additionally, we look for opportunities to expand our products into additional patient populations through clinical trials, new presentations and our support of select, investigator-initiated studies. We actively pursue opportunities to acquire additional marketed products as well as late-stage development product candidates in our target medical specialties. Our clinical team is developing a pipeline of new product candidates largely to address poorly met medical needs.
We are supplementing these activities with the earlier-stage drug development at Cumberland Emerging Technologies (“CET”), our majority-owned subsidiary. CET partners with academic research institutions to identify and support the progress of promising new product candidates, which Cumberland has the opportunity to further develop and commercialize. Specifically, we are seeking long-term, sustainable growth by:
•Supporting and expanding the use of our marketed products. We continue to evaluate our products following their FDA approval to determine if additional clinical data could expand their market and use. For example, we have secured pediatric approval of Acetadote and Caldolor and are expanding the labeling for both brands accordingly. We also recently further expanded the labeling for Caldolor to allow its use prior to surgery. We will continue to explore such opportunities to bring our products to new patient populations.
•Selectively adding complementary brands. In addition to our product development activities, we are also seeking to acquire products or late-stage development product candidates to continue to build a portfolio of complementary brands. We focus on under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs as well as late-stage development products that address poorly met medical needs. We will continue to target product acquisition candidates that are competitively differentiated, have valuable intellectual property or other protective features, and allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure. Our acquisition of Sancuso is an example of this strategy.
•Progressing our clinical pipeline and incubating future product opportunities at CET. We believe it is important to build a pipeline of innovative new product opportunities, as we are doing through our ifetroban Phase II development programs. We are also supplementing our acquisitions and late-stage development activities with early-stage drug development activities with CET.
•Leveraging our infrastructure through co-promotion partnerships. We believe that our commercial infrastructure can help drive prescription volume and product sales. We look for strategic partners that can complement our capabilities and enhance opportunities for our brands. For example, our co-promotion partnerships have allowed us to expand the support for Kristalose across the U.S. 
•Building an international contribution to our business. We have established our own commercial capabilities, including three sales divisions, to cover the U.S. market for our products. We are also building a network of select international partners to register our products and make them available to patients in their countries. We will continue to develop our network of international partners while supporting our partners’ registration and commercialization efforts in their respective territories. The acquisition of Vibativ resulted in several new international partners and market opportunities. For example, we have new partnerships Tabuk Pharmaceutical for Vibativ in Saudi Arabia and PiSA Pharmaceutical for Caldolor in Mexico.
•Managing our operations with financial discipline. We continually work to manage our expenses in line with our revenues in order to deliver positive cash flow from operations. We remain in a strong financial position, with favorable gross margins and positive cash flow from operations. 
SALES AND MARKETING
Cumberland's sales and marketing team has broad industry experience in selling branded pharmaceuticals. Our sales and marketing executives direct our national marketing campaigns and maintain key national account relationships. They also manage our dedicated hospital, field and oncology sales forces, which are comprised of approximately 60 sales professionals. 
Hospital market: We promote Caldolor, Vaprisol, Acetadote and Vibativ through our dedicated hospital sales division. This organization targets key hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of sales professionals with substantial experience in the hospital market. Independent market data continues to indicate that the majority of pharmaceutical promotional spending is directed toward large, outpatient markets on drugs intended for chronic use rather than short-term, hospital use. 
We believe the hospital market is under-served and highly concentrated, and that it can be penetrated effectively by a small, dedicated sales force without large-scale promotional activity. Our established position in the hospital market provided the rationale for adding Vibativ as our first infectious disease product that complements our hospital product line. Our strategy has been to focus our hospital sales team on select, high-priority accounts. 
Gastroenterology market: We promote Kristalose and Omeclamox-Pak through a dedicated field sales team addressing a targeted group of physicians who are large prescribers of the products. Because the market for gastrointestinal diseases is broad in-patient scope, yet relatively narrow in physician base, we believe it provides opportunities that can be penetrated with a modest-sized sales force. We also believe that we can increase market share for these products through our sales and marketing activities.
Oncology market: In early 2022, we formed a new oncology sales force to promote our Sancuso brand. This organization targets key oncologists and clinics across the U.S. and is comprised of both inside and field-based sales professionals. The division is initially comprised of seven individuals who formerly supported Sancuso for Kyowa Kirin. This initial group can be expanded through additional personnel or augmented through co-promotion arrangements.
Our commercial executives conduct ongoing analyses to evaluate marketing campaigns and promotional programs in support of our brands. The evaluations include development of product profiles, testing of the profiles against the needs of the market, determining what additional product information or development work is needed to effectively market the products and preparing financial forecasts. 
We utilize professional branding and packaging as well as promotional items to support our products, including direct mail, sales brochures, journal advertising, educational and reminder leave-behinds, patient educational pieces, coupons and product sampling. We also regularly attend select medical meetings and trade shows to expand the awareness of our products. 
Our national accounts team is responsible for key large buyers and related marketing programs. This team maintains relationships with our wholesaler customers as well as with third-party payors such as group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital buying groups, outpatient centers, state and federal government purchasers, and health insurance companies.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Since inception, we have had an active business development initiative focused on acquiring rights to marketed products and product candidates that fit our strategy and target markets. We source business development opportunities through our international network of advisory firms and individual pharmaceutical industry and medical advisors. A multi-disciplinary internal management team reviews these opportunities on a regular basis using a group of selection criteria. We have historically focused on product opportunities that are a strategic fit with our commercial organization, development expertise and medical focus, employing a variety of transaction structures.
We have continued to build our product portfolio of complementary, niche brands largely through product acquisitions and late-stage development of product candidates.
Our primary targets are under-promoted, FDA - approved drugs with existing brand recognition and late-stage development product candidates that address unmet or poorly met medical needs in the hospital acute care, gastroenterology and oncology markets. We believe that by focusing mainly on approved or late-stage products, we can minimize the significant risk, cost and time associated with drug development.
We continue to strategically review our brands, pipeline and capabilities, as well as our international partners. We believe that it is prudent to continually evaluate our product portfolio, partners, and organization in order to ensure a proper focus and the needed supporting capabilities.

("Foxland") to package, distribute and promote an authorized generic form of our Kristalose product to physician targets that we do not cover. We renewed our agreement with Foxland in 2022.
Nordic License Agreement
In July 2022, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Nordic Pharma (“Nordic”) that addresses the responsibilities and financial arrangements regarding our license to Nordic’s methotrexate line of products for the U.S. Our line of prefilled methotrexate syringes, marketed under the brand name RediTrex in the U.S., is covered by the license.
Based on the amendment, Nordic may assume responsibility for commercializing the methotrexate products in the U.S. after June 30, 2023. We will continue to distribute and support the RediTrex product line during a transition period until then. Following the return of the license, Nordic will provide us with a royalty on their future sales of the products through April 2035. The companies will continue to collaborate on any transition and the ongoing commercialization of the product line.
Cumberland transferred the marketing authorization associated with the RediTrex product line to Nordic. Nordic returned the 180,000 shares we issued to them that were associated with the license and refunded the $1 million we paid them following the brand’s approval in the U.S. Nordic has also issued a credit note in favor of Cumberland in the amount of $1 million for the unpaid milestone payment due from us which was associated with our launch of the product line.
Clinigen Strategic Dissolution Agreement
We previously entered into an agreement with the Clinigen Group plc ("Clinigen"), an international specialty pharmaceutical and services company, to commercialize select Clinigen products in the U.S. In May 2016, we announced an agreement with Clinigen to acquire an exclusive license and commercialize Ethyol® in the U.S. We then announced in January 2017, our second agreement with Clinigen to acquire an exclusive license and launch Totect® in the U.S.
During May 2019, following a strategic review of our partners, products and organization, we entered into a dissolution agreement with Clinigen in which Cumberland returned the exclusive rights to commercialize Ethyol and Totect in the United States to Clinigen. Under the final terms of the amended dissolution agreement we transitioned from our current arrangement with Clinigen effective December 31, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Cumberland was no longer involved directly or indirectly with the distribution, marketing and promotion of either Ethyol or Totect or any competing products. In exchange for the return of these product license rights and not competing with either product, we received $5 million in financial consideration paid over the two-years ending December 31, 2021.
CET University Collaboration Agreements
Through CET, we collaborate with a select group of academic research institutions located in the Mid-South region of the U.S. to identify, co-develop and seek grant funding for promising biomedical technologies emerging from those research institutions. CET is collaborating with Vanderbilt University and other regional academic research institutions and has entered into a series of agreements to access and collaborate on the development of innovative product candidates. These arrangements enable CET to team with university-based researchers to advance their scientific discoveries and breakthroughs by designing new product candidates to improve patient care and address unmet medical needs. CET has been able to help secure federal small business grant funding to support these various projects.

In addition to coordinating the call center, our clinical/regulatory group generates medical information letters, provides informational memos to our sales forces and assists with ongoing training for the sales forces.
CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND STUDY RESULTS 
Vibativ Clinical Manuscripts
Vibativ is a patented, FDA-approved injectable anti-infective for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections. It addresses a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including those that are considered difficult-to-treat and multidrug-resistant. 
In late 2019, we announced a publication in Infectious Diseases and Therapy, with study results showing numerically superior cure rates of telavancin compared to vancomycin within a subset of patients who were enrolled in Phase 3 ATTAIN trials and had hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by bacteria with low susceptibility to vancomycin. Additionally, an online publication in Drugs - Real World Outcomes, detailed the positive clinical outcomes that resulted from treating multiple infection types with Vibativ, including complicated skin infections, bone and joint infections, bacteremia and endocarditis, and lower respiratory tract infections.
In May 2020, Cumberland announced a new study published in Drugs - Real World Outcomes, detailing the positive clinical outcomes that resulted from treating patients with bacteremia or endocarditis with Vibativ. This publication is a sub analysis of The Telavancin Observational Use Registry (TOUR™), a study conducted to record population characteristics, prescription information, and real-world clinical outcomes of patients with Gram-positive infections treated with Vibativ. The analysis suggests Vibativ is a promising and viable option for patients with bacteremia or endocarditis, including those with MRSA or another S. aureus pathogen.
Additionally, in May 2020, we announced the publication of two studies confirming the continued in vitro potency of telavancin. Both publications were part of continued surveillance of telavancin activity since 2011.  The first publication tested a global collection of 24,408 Gram-positive clinical isolates, and the second publication tested a U.S. collection of 15,882 S. aureus isolates. Both studies documented the sustained in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of telavancin—many years after its clinical approval—against Gram-positive clinical isolates collected worldwide over seven years, from 2011 through 2017.
Caldolor Clinical Manuscripts
In July 2020, we announced a study published in the Journal of Orthopedic Trauma, evaluating the efficacy of Caldolor administration in the management of acute pain in orthopedic trauma patients. The study also measured Caldolor’s ability in minimizing opioid use. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that Caldolor (ibuprofen) Injection reduced the quantity of opioids required to manage pain after a traumatic injury with fracture. In addition, the time to first narcotic medication was longer in the Caldolor group than with hospital standard of care. Pain was also managed better in the Caldolor group compared to standard of care narcotics. 
Additionally, in August 2020, we announced the results of a review of nine clinical studies evaluating Caldolor. The comprehensive review was published in the journal Clinical Therapeutics and involved 1,062 adult patients, with 757 receiving Caldolor and 305 receiving placebo or a comparator medication. The data noted that the use of Caldolor improved post-surgery recovery, decreased surgical stress, and reduced the use of opioids and over-the-counter medication. The study determined that patients given Caldolor experienced less postoperative pain and decreased opioid use. Study authors also concluded that the rapid administration and preemptive use of Caldolor should be considered in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for the management of postoperative pain including that of traumatic origin. 
Caldolor Newborn Study
We previously received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients six months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable NSAID approved for use in children. We then initiated a study to collect data on the use of Caldolor in children ranging in age from birth up to six months of age. Enrollment in that multi-center study was completed in 2019, and topline results were announced in 2020, indicating that Caldolor was well tolerated in this patient population, with no safety concerns noted. 
Renal Colic Study
During 2021, we report results from a clinical trial studying the comparison of intravenous ibuprofen with injectable ketorolac in renal colic pain management demonstrated that ibuprofen is the more rapid-acting drug in controlling pain caused by kidney stones. The study also indicated that the complete relief from pain with ibuprofen was twice as much as that of ketorolac. The findings build upon a body of medical evidence supporting the use of our Caldolor product for the treatment of patient pain.
Hyponatremia Publication
During 2021 we also reported on The Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation (“HOPE”) COVID-19 Registry Analysis. It was an international study of over 4,000 patients published in November 2020, found that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a high risk of developing hyponatremia. These COVID-19 patients also had a higher incidence of mortality due to their hyponatremia. The study results support the use of an intravenous vaptan to treat hyponatremia in critically ill patients afflicted with COVID-19.
Hyponatremia, an imbalance of serum sodium to body water, is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Our Vaprisol product is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment. Vaprisol has a proven day-1 response rate to normalize serum sodium levels in hyponatremic patients and move them out of the Intensive Care Unit as efficiently as possible.
Ifetroban Phase II Studies
We have been evaluating our ifetroban product candidate in a series of clinical studies. We have three Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating our ifetroban product candidate in 1) Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, a severe form of asthma, 2) Systemic Sclerosis or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and 3) patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare, fatal, genetic neuromuscular disease results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart and lung muscles. Investigational new study applications have been cleared by the FDA enabling us to launch clinical studies in each of these areas.
We have also completed two pilot Phase II studies involving 1) patients suffering from Hepatorenal Syndrome, a life-threatening condition involving liver and kidney failure and 2) patients with Portal Hypertension associated with chronic liver disease. There were no significant safety issues identified with the use of ifetroban in these patients.
Additional pilot studies of ifetroban are underway, including several investigator-initiated trials. 
Enrollment in our clinical studies was interrupted during 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, many of our clinical study sites have reopened and resumed screening of patients for potential enrollment into our studies. We are awaiting results from the studies underway before deciding on the best development path for the registration of ifetroban, our first new chemical entity.
New Hospital Product Candidate Study
Cumberland was responsible for the formulation, development and FDA approval of both Acetadote and Caldolor. Our Medical Advisory Board has helped us identify additional opportunities that address unmet or poorly met medical needs. As a result, Cumberland has successfully designed, formulated and completed preclinical studies for a cholesterol reducing agent for use in the hospital setting. 
We previously completed a Phase I study which defined the pharmacokinetic properties and provided a favorable safety profile for this new product candidate. The study results and a proposed clinical development plan were discussed with the FDA.
 A Phase II study has been initiated and patient enrollment completed. We have completed the study report, filed it with the FDA and continue to consider next steps for this product development program.
Additional Testing Program
Cumberland entered into a non-clinical evaluation agreement, to test one of our products against bacterial strains utilizing the preclinical services program funded by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (“DMID”), part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), an agency of the U.S. government.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
Cumberland Foundation
We have formed the Cumberland Pharma Foundation (the “Foundation”) to provide the ongoing philanthropic endeavors of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The Foundation was formed as an independent, nonprofit corporation designed to qualify as a tax-exempt organization pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation’s Board of Directors is comprised of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals executives who are responsible for overseeing the Foundation’s ongoing activities including charitable contributions.
We initially provided a grant of 50,000 shares of our common stock to the Foundation. The shares will address the ongoing financial needs of the Foundation, with most of the shares expected to be held for the opportunity to realize long term appreciation to support the Foundation’s future.
The Foundation maintains independent financial statements and its contributions will not impact the financial statements of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. Initial annual grants by the Foundation have been and remain consistent with the historic level of contributions made by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals.
Cumberland Health and Wellness Political Action Committee
We have also formed the Cumberland Health and Wellness Political Action Committee (the “PAC”). The objective of the PAC is to support candidates and policies that are consistent with Cumberland’s mission of advancing patient care. The PAC’s activities will be at the local, state and federal level and conducted in a bi-partisan manner. 
The initial committee membership is comprised of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals employees. The PAC received initial funding from us, and future funding will include voluntary individual contributions from Cumberland Pharmaceuticals directors and employees.
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
Manufacturing
 We partner with third parties for certain non-core, capital-intensive capabilities, including the manufacturing and distribution of our products. We manage these third-party relationships and are responsible for the quality review and release of each lot of our products.
Acetadote®
We have an agreement with one manufacturer, who provided commercial supplies of Acetadote in 2022. 
Caldolor®
We have agreements with multiple manufacturers for the supply of Caldolor and during 2022 we obtained commercial supplies from three of these manufacturers for our international and domestic Caldolor requirements. 
Kristalose®
We have an agreement for the purchase of Kristalose API with an international supplier. We also had manufacturing arrangements with a packager who provided finished supplies of the product for commercial and sampling purposes during 2022. 
Omeclamox-Pak®
The packager for Omeclamox-Pak encountered financial difficulties in 2020 due to the economic impact of COVID-19, and their operations are currently suspended. As a result, we depleted our inventory of the product and notified the FDA that the product is currently unavailable. We are awaiting resumption of those operations, while also exploring other alternatives to restart the product’s packaging.
RediTrex®
In 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to an injectable methotrexate product line of pre-filled syringes. In 2019, we received FDA approval for the product line. Our licensor is responsible for providing us the packaged and labeled commercial supply of the product.
During 2022, we entered into two amendments to our agreement with Nordic Pharma. Pursuant to the amendments, in exchange for financial consideration, Nordic may assume responsibility for distributing the methotrexate products in the U.S. after June 30, 2023.
Sancuso®
As part of the acquisition of Sancuso, we obtained an initial supply of finished goods inventory. The agreement with the manufacturer of Sancuso was assigned to us and there were additional goods supplied to us during 2022. The production is in the process of being moved to one of the manufacturer’s other facilities. In late 2022, that new facility was approved by the FDA to manufacture and supply Sancuso. 
Vaprisol®
As part of the acquisition of Vaprisol, we obtained a significant existing supply of raw material inventory. We reached an agreement during 2020 with a new manufacturer to provide us with long-term supplies of the product. We subsequently completed the transfer of the product’s manufacturing to the new facility in 2021. We informed the FDA that supplies of the product are not currently available and are awaiting approval for that new facility. Our new manufacturing partner is working with the FDA to address several Form 483 and warning letter issues in a timely manner. Meanwhile, we are working with them to support a special, interim supply of compounded product for critically ill patients, while awaiting the needed facility approval to relaunch Vaprisol.
Vibativ®
Through our acquisition of Vibativ, we obtained a multi-year supply of raw material, work in process and finished goods inventory. As a result of the agreement, we are now responsible for the future manufacturing of the product. We completed the transfer of the product’s manufacturing activities to a new supplier and received FDA approval for that facility.
Distribution
Like many pharmaceutical companies, we engage a third-party with appropriate facilities and logistical expertise to support the U.S. distribution of our products. In 2022, Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions exclusively handled our U.S. product logistics activities, including warehousing, shipping, and various other customer activities. Our primary customers are the wholesalers of pharmaceuticals who provide our products to hospitals, clinics and retail pharmacies in the U.S.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
We own the trademarks for each of our branded pharmaceutical products as well as for our corporate name and logo. We have applied for trademark registration for other various names and logos. Over time, we intend to maintain registrations on trademarks that remain valuable to our business.
We seek to protect our products from competition through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Proprietary rights, including patents, are an important element of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute agreements providing for protection of our confidential information upon commencement of their employment or engagement. We also require confidentiality agreements from entities to which we provide our confidential information or materials.
Acetadote®
We developed a new formulation of Acetadote (acetylcysteine) Injection as part of a Phase IV commitment in response to a request by the FDA to evaluate the reduction of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ("EDTA") from the 
product's formulation. In April 2012, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,148,356 (the “356 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 356 Acetadote Patent encompass the new Acetadote formulation and include composition of matter claims. Following its issuance, the 356 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 356 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in May 2026, which time period includes a 270-day patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO.
Following the issuance of the 356 Acetadote Patent, we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from InnoPharma, Inc. ("InnoPharma"), Paddock Laboratories, LLC (“Paddock”), Mylan Institutional LLC (“Mylan”), Sagent Agila LLC ("Sagent") and Perrigo Company ("Perrigo") challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement and/or invalidity. We responded by filing five separate infringement lawsuits, in the appropriate United States District Courts, to contest each of the challenges. 
On November 12, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Paddock and Perrigo to resolve the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 
On November 1, 2013, the United States District Courts filed opinions granting Sagent’s and InnoPharma’s motions to dismiss our suits and we agreed not to file an appeal or motion to reconsider, thereby resolving the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 
Under the Settlement Agreement, Paddock and Perrigo admit that the 356 Acetadote Patent is valid and enforceable and that any Paddock or Perrigo generic version of Acetadote (with or without EDTA) would infringe upon the 356 Acetadote Patent. In addition, Paddock and Perrigo will not challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership or patentability of the 356 Acetadote Patent through its expiration currently scheduled for May 2026. On November 12, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo (the “License and Supply Agreement”). 
Under the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, if a third party receives final approval from the FDA for an ANDA to sell a generic Acetadote product and such third party made such generic version available for purchase in commercial quantities in the United States, we are to supply Perrigo with an Authorized Generic version of our Acetadote product. 
On May 18, 2012, we also submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection that contain EDTA, based in part on the FDA's request that we evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA from our original Acetadote formulation.
On November 7, 2012, the FDA responded to the Citizen Petition denying our request and on November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. We brought suit against the FDA contesting the FDA's decision to approve the InnoPharma generic on November 13, 2012. 
On September 30, 2013, the United States District Court filed an opinion granting a summary judgment in favor of the FDA regarding this suit.
As noted above, during 2012 the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. Upon this condition, in accordance with the License and Supply agreement with Perrigo, we began to supply Perrigo with our Authorized Generic. On January 7, 2013, Perrigo announced initial distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection product.
On March 19, 2013, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,399,445 (the “445 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 445 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. On April 8, 2013, the 445 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 445 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.

On February 10, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,952,065 (the “065 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 065 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acute liver failure. The 065 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.
On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("District Court") ruled in our favor in our lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The opinion upheld our 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge. The District Court ruled that Mylan is liable to us for infringement of the 445 Acetadote patent in light of Mylan's Abbreviated New Drug Application in which Mylan sought to market a generic version of Acetadote. 
On November 17, 2015, the District Court entered an order enjoining Mylan and its affiliates from selling or using its generic version of Acetadote until August 2025, the date of expiration of the 445 Acetadote Patent. On October 30, 2015, Mylan filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Appeals Court").
On May 3, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 9,327,028 (the “028 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 028 Acetadote Patent encompass administration methods of acetylcysteine injection, without specification of the presence or lack of EDTA in the injection. Following its issuance, the 028 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and it is scheduled to expire in July 2031.
On January 26, 2017, the Appeals Court affirmed the District Court ruling in our favor in our lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The Appeals Court opinion affirmed the District Court’s ruling upholding our 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge.
On November 3, 2017, we became aware of a Paragraph IV certification notice from Exela Pharma Sciences, LLC challenging the 356, 445, 061, 738, and 028 Acetadote Patents on the basis of non-infringement.

COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our continued success in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products will depend, in part, upon our ability to compete against existing and future products in our target markets. Competitive factors directly affecting our markets include but are not limited to: 
•product attributes such as efficacy, safety, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness; 
•brand awareness and recognition driven by sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 
•intellectual property and other exclusivity rights; 
•availability of resources to build and maintain developmental and commercial capabilities; 
•successful business development activities; 
•extent of third-party reimbursements, insurance coverage; and 
•establishment of advantageous collaborations to conduct development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts.
A number of our competitors possess research and development and sales and marketing capabilities as well as financial resources greater than ours. These competitors, in addition to emerging companies and academic research institutions, may be developing, or in the future could develop, new technologies that could compete with our current and future products or render our products obsolete.
Our products face competition from other branded products, generics, and alternate medical treatments. Our task is to position each brand to feature its competitive advantages, implement a well thought out marketing plan and provide focused sales and other tactical support. 
Acetadote®
Acetadote is our injectable formulation of N-acetylcysteine ("NAC") for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. NAC is accepted worldwide as the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose. Our competitors in the acetaminophen overdose market are those companies selling orally administered NAC including, but not limited to, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bedford Laboratories division of Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Roxane Laboratories, Inc., InnoPharma Inc. and Hospira Inc.
In November 2012, InnoPharma Inc. was granted approval by the FDA to distribute their generic form of the old formulation of Acetadote containing EDTA. In late 2012, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo that included the right to distribute our Authorized Generic Acetadote injection product. Our branded Acetadote now competes with both the EDTA free Authorized Generic Acetadote distributed by Paddock and Perrigo along with generic Acetadote products that contain EDTA. 
Manufacturers of the old Acetadote formulation include: Akorn, AuroMedics Pharma, Fresenius Kabi and Sagent Pharmaceuticals. 
Caldolor®
Caldolor is marketed for the treatment of pain and fever, primarily in a hospital or surgery center setting. A variety of other products address the acute pain market:
•Morphine, the most commonly used product for the treatment of acute, post-operative pain, is manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies;
•Other generic injectable opioids, including fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, address this market;
•Ketorolac tromethamine (brand name Toradol®), an injectable NSAID, is also manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies;
•IV acetaminophen (brand name Ofirmev®), an injectable analgesic product is sold by Mallinckrodt plc, and there are also generic versions from different manufacturers available; and
•Bupivacaine injectable suspension (brand name Exparel®), product sold by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., two additional bupivacaine products, Xaracoll and Posimir, were more recently approved.
We are aware of other product candidates in development to treat acute pain including injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of existing therapies and extended release anesthetics. We believe non-narcotic analgesics for the treatment of post-surgical pain are the primary potential competitors to Caldolor.
In addition to the injectable analgesic products above, many companies are developing analgesics for specific indications such as migraine and neuropathic pain, oral extended-release forms of existing narcotic and non-narcotic products, as well as those with new methods of delivery such as transdermal. We are not aware of any approved injectable products indicated for the treatment of fever in the U.S. other than Caldolor and Ofirmev. 
There are, however, numerous drugs available to physicians to reduce fevers in hospital settings via oral administration to the patient, including ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin. These drugs are manufactured by numerous pharmaceutical companies.
Kristalose®
Kristalose is a dry powder crystalline prescription formulation of lactulose indicated for the treatment of constipation. The U.S. constipation therapy market includes various prescription and over the counter, or OTC, products. The branded prescription products which we believe are our primary competitors are:
•Lubiproston (brand name Amitiza®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adults, is manufactured and sold by Mallinckrodt  Pharmaceuticals.
•Naloxegol (brand name Movantik®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic non-cancer pain and recently acquired by RedHill Biopharma in the first quarter of 2020. 
•Linaclotide (brand name Linzess®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is sold by Allergan, Inc. and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
•Plecanatide (brand name Trulance®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is sold by Synergy Pharmaceuticals.
•Generic and branded liquid lactulose products are marketed by a number of pharmaceutical companies.
•Lactitol for oral solution (brand name Pizensy), an oral, osmotic laxative indicated  for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and distributed by Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  was recently approved by the FDA.
There are several hundred OTC products used to treat constipation marketed by numerous pharmaceutical and consumer health companies. MiraLax (polyethylene glycol 3350), previously a prescription product, was indicated for the treatment of constipation and manufactured and marketed by Bayer. MiraLax was converted to an OTC product in February 2007 and recently, the FDA rescinded the approval of the generic prescription polyethylene glycol 3350 products.
Omeclamox-Pak®
Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and duodenal ulcer disease. It combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications packaged in a daily dose pack for patient convenience: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. The three individual components of Omeclamox-Pak are also available from other suppliers through three separate prescriptions. 
While there are several competitor products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the two actively marketed products for this condition. In addition, compared to the competing products, Omeclamox-Pak has the lowest pill burden, fewest days of therapy and convenient twice daily dosing. The prescription combination products, indicated for treatment of H. pylori, which we believe are our primary competitors are:
•PrevPac®, an oral product sold by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. There are also approved generic versions of PrevPac;
•Pylera®, an oral product manufactured and sold by Allergan plc; and
•Talicia®, an oral product manufactured by RedHill Biopharma which was recently approved by the FDA.
RediTrex®
RediTrex is methotrexate for subcutaneous administration in a unique syringe designed for ease of use, improved accuracy, and enhanced safety. It is indicated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and severe, recalcitrant, or disabling psoriasis unresponsive to alternative treatments.
This market is highly competitive with drugs from several different therapeutic classes available for treatment. Methotrexate is considered a standard of care especially when patients fail to respond adequately to low dose steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methotrexate is available in multiple dose forms including oral, subcutaneous, and intra-venous. Methotrexate may be used alone or in combination with drugs from other therapeutic classes to adequately control patient symptoms.
RediTrex competes with other dose forms and delivery systems for methotrexate including, oral tablets, conventional vial and syringe administration, and auto-injector pens. Oral tablets and conventional vials are generic and available from many suppliers. There are two auto-injector pen products available, Rasuvo and Otrexup. 
RediTrex also competes with or may be used in combination with drugs from other therapeutic classes including, injectable biologics like Humira and Enbrel and oral JAK inhibitors like Xaljanz. These newer agents are more expensive than the methotrexate products but benefit from significant promotion to patients and doctors. 
Sancuso®
Sancuso is the only transdermal patch FDA approved for the management of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Each patch delivers up to 5 days of treatment with granisetron, a standard of care for CINV, through the skin. Recommended treatment suggests the patch be applied 24 to 48 hours prior to chemotherapy treatment and remain in place for five days.
While there are no other transdermal products available to treat CINV, there are a large number of generic and branded oral products as well as a limited number of injectables. Cumberland considers the oral branded products to be the most important competition including Akynzeo, Emend Oral, Varubi, Zuplenz, and Kytril.
Vaprisol®
Vaprisol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the first and only intravenously administered branded treatment. The other competing product is Samsca, an oral product sold by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company.
Vibativ®
Vibativ is a potent, once-daily, injectable antibiotic for the treatment of certain gram-positive infections. Vibativ is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus when alternative treatments are not suitable. There are several generic and branded antibiotics that compete for these indications. 
The major generic competitors are vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin. Vancomycin is by far the most widely used agent. Newer branded agents are also available including:
•Ceftaroline fosamil (brand name Teflaro® ) an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Allergan
•Dalbavancin (brand name Dalvance® ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Allergan
•Oritavancin (brand name Orbactiv® ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Melinta
We are aware of a number of other novel antibiotics which are currently in development. 
Antibiotic drug selection is based both on an empiric and susceptibility proven basis. In the hospital setting, cost is an important factor which favors the use of generic agents as long as they are effective. Newer agents are often reserved for two reasons: they are valuable in the treatment of patients that fail to respond to generics and it is considered good practice to conserve the use of these agents to reduce the risk of resistance. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The development of new pharmaceutical products can be a long, expensive and risky process. There is no assurance we will obtain successful study results or secure the needed market approvals for our pipeline product candidates. Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. For more information, see "Risks Relating to Government Regulation" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10K. 
In the U.S., the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), the Public Health Service Act, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Application ("NDAs") or biologics license applications, ("BLAs"), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
We, our manufacturers and contract research organizations may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, (OSHA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries.
FDA Approval Process
The FDA is a regulatory agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. A key responsibility is to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs sold in the United States. The FDA manages this responsibility into two phases: pre-approval (premarket) and post approval (post market). The FDA reviews manufacturers' applications to market drugs in the United States; a drug may not be sold unless it has FDA approval. The FDA continues its oversight of drug safety and effectiveness as long as the drug is on the market.
To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval. To get that approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations, ensure that its manufacturing plant passes FDA inspection, and obtain FDA approval for the drug's labeling, a term that includes all written material about the drug, including, for example, packaging, prescribing information for physicians and patient brochures.
The progression to drug approval begins before FDA involvement. First, scientists work in the laboratory to discover and develop a new compound. Next, basic questions on safety are answered by nonclinical testing with animals and then, a drug or biotechnology company develops a prototype drug. That company must seek clearance from the FDA by way of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application to test the product with human subjects. 
Those tests, called clinical trials, are carried out sequentially in Phase I, II, and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analyses in an NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity.
The FDA and associated regulations detail the requirements at each step. The FDA uses a few special mechanisms to expedite drug development and the review process when a drug might address an unmet need or a serious disease or condition. Those mechanisms include accelerated approval, fast track and priority reviews and the newer designation, breakthrough therapy.
The sponsor of the drug typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials are generally conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, primarily to collect and assess pharmacokinetics and safety data at one or more dosages prior to proceeding into patients. 
In Phase II clinical trials, the sponsor evaluates the early efficacy of the product in short term trials on the targeted indication and identifies possible adverse effects and safety risks in a patient population. 
Phase III clinical trials typically involve testing for patients in long term trials examining safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically-dispersed test sites.
The FDA requires that clinical trials be conducted in accordance with the FDA's Good Clinical Practice GCP requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee (outside of the U.S.), of each clinical site generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent and may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements or may impose other conditions.
The results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for marketing approval. The NDA undergoes a 60-day validation review period before it is accepted for filing. 
If the NDA is found to be incomplete, it will not be accepted. Once the NDA is validated and accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. 
Under policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA (currently PDUFA VI - effective October 1, 2017), the FDA has a target timeline of 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by two months to address deficiencies, or by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review clock period. If the FDA's evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable and meet all regulations, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Priority review is reserved for drugs that represent a “significant improvement in safety or efficacy” over existing treatments and FDA endeavors to complete these reviews in six months.
If the NDA meets with FDA approval, a letter will be sent out indicating approval and final labeling recommendations. If not, a complete response letter will be sent to applicants indicating that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. 
The complete response letter will describe the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application and what changes must be made before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding 
whether the application will ultimately be approved. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the proposed indication(s) under study. While the FDA's PDUFA 2021 Performance Report showed a continued increase in the percentage of first-cycle approval letters for new molecular entities rising from 56% for FY 2009 to preliminary reports of 100% for FY 2021, we cannot be certain that timely first-cycle approvals will be maintained by the FDA.
While the time and cost of completing these steps and obtaining FDA approval can vary dramatically depending on the drug, it can take many years and cost millions of dollars for a novel drug.
Section 505(b) New Drug Applications
An NDA may be submitted under different methods, a 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2) or 505(j). Section 505(b) provides for the submission of an NDA to support the approval of a drug. Upon approval, a drug may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indication(s) in the approved dosage form. Further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for any additional indications or dosage forms. 
The FDA also requires post market safety surveillance reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug, which may result in withdrawal of approval after marketing begins if significant adverse safety findings are found.
Section 505(b)(1) or the 'full' NDA is used for new chemical entities ("NCEs") and requires full clinical and nonclinical development of a compound. Marketing exclusivity assigned to a 505(b)(1) approval is five years. A 505(b)(2) NDA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant using previously reported safety and efficacy data, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Generally new studies are required to provide data on the proposed change. 
Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication or combination drugs. Marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) submission is three years. 
Both 505 (b)(1) and (b)(2) are eligible for seven years of exclusivity for orphan drugs and/or six months for pediatric exclusivity. Any marketing exclusivity is independent of patent exclusivity. We successfully secured FDA approvals for Acetadote in January 2004, for Caldolor in June 2009 and for RediTrex in 2019 pursuant to the 505(b)(2) pathway. 
Orphan drug designation
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (the "Orphan Drug Act") encourages manufacturers to seek approval of products intended to treat “rare diseases and conditions” with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the development costs for the product. For products that receive orphan drug designation by the FDA, the Orphan Drug Act provides tax credits for clinical research, FDA assistance with protocol design, eligibility for FDA grants to fund clinical studies, waiver of the FDA application fee, and a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the product following FDA marketing approval. 
Acetadote received Orphan Drug designation in October 2001 and in 2004 the FDA approved the product to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Acetadote was entitled to marketing exclusivity until January 2011 for the treatment of this approved indication.
Section 505(j) abbreviated new drug applications
An abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") is a type of NDA where approval of a generic drug is based on demonstrating comparability to an innovator drug product (the RLD or Reference Listed Drug). Applications are "abbreviated" because they generally don't include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Generics must demonstrate that the product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner and is comparable to the 'innovator' product in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use). 
Abbreviated applications may be submitted for drug products that are the same as a listed drug and must be identical in active ingredient(s), form, strength, route of administration, and identical in conditions of use (non-exclusive uses). Products are declared suitable based on a suitability petition to the FDA. If the petition is approved, the sponsor may then submit the ANDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act", is a 1984 United States federal law which established the modern system of generic drugs. 
Hatch-Waxman amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(j) 21 U.S.C. 355(j) sets forth the process by which would-be marketers of generic drugs can file ANDAs to seek FDA approval of the generic. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV), the so-called Paragraph IV, allows 180-day exclusivity to companies that are the "first-to-file" an ANDA against holders of patents for branded counterparts.
These Hatch-Waxman amendments grant generic manufacturers the ability to mount a validity challenge without incurring the cost of entry or risking enormous damages flowing from any possible infringement. Hatch-Waxman essentially redistributes the relative risk assessments and explains the flow of settlement funds and their magnitude. Hatch-Waxman gives generics considerable leverage in patent litigation.
Health care legislation
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, was enacted into law, which modified the revenue provisions of the PPACA. The PPACA as amended by the HCERA constitutes the healthcare reform legislation. The following highlights certain provisions of the legislation that may affect us.
Pharmaceutical Industry Fee: Beginning in calendar-year 2011, an annual fee was imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs (e.g., Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, Department of Defense programs and TRICARE). 
The annual fee is allocated to companies based on their previous calendar-year market share using sales data that the government agencies that purchase the pharmaceuticals will provide to the Treasury Department. Although we participate in governmental programs that subject us to this fee, our sales volume in such programs is less than $10 million, with the first $5 million of sales being exempt from the fee. This fee has not had a material impact and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations.
In addition, PDUFA imposes annual program fees. An applicant will be assessed annual prescription drug program fees for prescription drug products, incurring a fee for each strength of a drug product. An applicant may not be assessed more than five prescription drug program fees for a fiscal year for prescription drug products identified in a single approved application.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The PPACA also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for aggregation and subsequent public disclosure. Under the Sunshine Act, beginning August 1, 2013, we have collected data regarding reportable transfers of value and have reported such data to CMS. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. In addition to the Federal Sunshine Act, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.
Medicaid Rebate Rate: Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program we currently are required to provide rebates for covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, we also are required to participate in the Public Health Service's 340B drug pricing program, which requires us to agree to charge no more than a designated ceiling price for covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to community health clinics and other 
entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.
Product Serialization: In November of 2013, the FDA passed the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). The DSCSA was created to strengthen the security of the drug distribution supply chain by adding controls such as a national pharmaceutical track and trace system and establishing national standards for licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. DSCSA requires trading partners, including manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers to provide transaction information to subsequent purchasers for certain prescription drugs. We have taken necessary steps to implement this program and are in compliance with all requirements by the November 2018 deadline.
21st Century Cures Act: The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), signed into law on December 13, 2016, is designed to help accelerate medical product development and bring new innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more efficiently. The law builds on the FDA's ongoing work to incorporate the perspectives of patients into the development of drugs, biological products, and devices in the FDA's decision-making process. The Cures Act enhances the FDA's ability to modernize clinical trial designs and clinical outcome assessments, which will speed the development and review of novel medical products, including medical countermeasures.
Specifically, the Cures Act enables us to work with the FDA in the development of new biomarkers, clinical outcome assessments, surrogate endpoints, and patient reported outcomes. It allows for the use of data summaries (rather than full clinical trials for approval) as well as the use of real-world evidence to support approval of new indications of approved medical products, or to help satisfy post-approval study requirements for marketed products.
Build Back Better Act and Other Proposed Legislation: The Build Back Better Act ("BBBA") was introduced in the 117th Congress and included provisions that were intended to lower the price of prescription drugs, including granting the Medicare program the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices and imposing tax penalties on drug manufacturers if the price of drugs increase too rapidly. Ultimately the BBBA was not enacted, however, future legislative initiatives are likely to include provisions targeted at containing costs in the prescription drug market.
Post Approval Activities
Once a drug is on the U.S. market (following FDA approval of the NDA), the FDA continues to address drug production, distribution, and use. FDA activities are based on ensuring drug safety and effectiveness. They address product integrity, labeling, reporting of research and adverse events, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, physician advertising and direct-to-consumer advertising.
If we amend the NDA for an FDA approved product, such as adding safety or efficacy labeling claims, promoting those new claims, making certain manufacturing changes or product enhancements, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. 
Securing FDA approval for new indications, product enhancements, and manufacturing and labeling changes may require us to conduct additional clinical trials under the FDA's IND regulations. Even if such studies are conducted, they are still subject to the same requirements and timelines as an original NDA.
The FDA continuously gathers information about possible adverse reactions to the products it has approved for use. The FDA requires all manufacturers to report adverse events. It also provides a procedure for consumers and physicians to voluntarily report their concerns about drugs. The agency collects those reports through MedWatch and uses its FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to store and analyze them. Because some events may occur after the use of a drug for reasons unrelated to the product, the FDA reviews the events to assess which ones may indicate a problem with that particular drug. 
They then use information gleaned from the surveillance data to determine a course of action. They might recommend a change in drug labeling to alert users to a potential problem, or perhaps, require the manufacturer to study the observed association between the drug and the adverse event.
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. 
The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
In addition to these U.S. laws, we are subject to similar laws that govern our marketing practices and financial arrangements with health care providers and otherwise are intended to prohibit illicit kickbacks and bribery, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Federal False Claims Act
The federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. 
A number of pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
HIPAA and Other Data Protection Laws
In the United States, we and our collaborators are subject to numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. These laws include obligations related to protecting the privacy and security of health-related personal information, including information that we may obtain through the clinical trial process. In addition, similar laws and regulations exist in Europe and other jurisdictions, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.
ICH - International Committee on Harmonization
Outside of the U.S., our ability to market our products will depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) provides a set of standards that most regulatory authorities adhere to (e.g. U.S., Europe, and Japan) allowing greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration, thereby reducing or obviating duplication of testing carried out during the research and development of new human medicines. Regulatory harmonization offers many direct benefits to both regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry with beneficial impact for the protection of public health.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with such regulations. We anticipate that the effects of compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
SEASONALITY
There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business.
BACKLOG
Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for our products, backlog of orders is not considered material to our business.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2022, we had 85 employees. We believe that our future will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel, including hospital oncology and field sales personnel in particular. To that end, we work with qualified search firms to identify talent, we measure and adjust compensation levels to remain competitive and we work closely with team members to support their success.
SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We make statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
