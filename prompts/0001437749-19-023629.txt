The Company’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. Soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to twenty-four ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by the Company’s twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, we make soft pretzels which are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily quick-frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
 
The Company’s principal marketing program in the Food Service segment includes supplying ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven. The Company retains ownership of the equipment placed in customer locations, and as a result, customers are not required to make an investment in equipment.

These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts and make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance.

As the soft pretzel, frozen juice treat and dessert, bakery products and related markets evolve, additional competitors and new competing products may enter the markets. Competitive factors in these markets include product quality, customer service, taste, price, identity and brand name awareness, method of distribution and sales promotions.

Risks Associated with Foreign Operations
 
Foreign operations generally involve greater risk than doing business in the United States. Foreign economies differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States’ economy in such respects as the level of inflation and debt, which may result in fluctuations in the value of the country’s currency and real property. Sales of our foreign operations were $33,906,000, $32,459,000 and $31,001,000 in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At September 28, 2019, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $26 million or 2.6% of total assets which was significantly less than the prior year as we moved cash to the United States. At September 29, 2018, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $45 million or 4.8% of total assets.
Employees
 
The Company has about 4,600 full and part time employees and approximately 1,500 workers employed by staffing agencies as of September 28, 2019.  About 1,200 production and distribution employees throughout the Company are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
