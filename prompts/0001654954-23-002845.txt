Item 1.   Business.

 Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “ZIVO,” “the Registrant” or “the Company” refer to Zivo Bioscience, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries.

Overview

We are a research and development company operating in both the biotech and agtech sectors, with an intellectual property portfolio comprised of proprietary algal and bacterial strains, biologically active molecules and complexes, production techniques, cultivation techniques and patented or patent-pending inventions for applications in human and animal health. 

We believe that our proprietary algal culture and materials derived therefrom show promise in benefiting both animal and human health, primarily through inflammation-modulating and immune-boosting properties. Overall, our efforts have been centered around two potential value-creating initiatives; the first being the identification of bioactive extracts or novel bioactive molecules from our proprietary algal culture to treat various diseases, and second, the utilization of our proprietary algal culture in its whole form as a food product to leverage its nutritional value. In the first quarter of 2022, we reformulated our biotech and agtech businesses around these two concepts. We reviewed the market potential (scale and profit) and the technical and business risks associated with each of the opportunities we had been working on and developed a focused strategy for each business.

Biotech Business Strategy

We are seeking to partner with established animal health companies and create value through licensing or other commercial arrangements, while accelerating final product development and mitigating market introduction risk.

Review of isolated active materials derived from our proprietary algal culture and their potential treatment applications led us to identify a product candidate for treating coccidiosis in broiler chickens as the best option for most rapidly generating significant revenue because coccidiosis is a global poultry industry issue costing chicken farmers between $8-13 billion annually, and because the clinical testing cycle for chickens is shorter than for other species. Most of the global animal health companies have products for the coccidiosis market; however, they are mostly antibiotic- or ionophore-based with essentially no new technology having been introduced in the last 60 years.

Coccidiosis Product Candidate

In numerous prior studies, ZIVO has demonstrated multiple benefits, including:


· | Minimized or eliminated the negative effects of coccidiosis on the digestive health in broiler chickens by numerous measures of gut health and overall well-being; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Reduced the incidence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli, and Clostridium perfringens, all significant sources of food-borne illness, in the digestive tract of broiler chickens in the absence of antibiotics or other antimicrobial compounds; and
· | Reduced mortality. 


The predominant treatment for coccidiosis in the poultry industry, in-feed anticoccidial drugs, target the Eimeria parasite directly and require constant use over the lifespan of the animal for efficacy and can over time result in the development of resistant Eimeria strains. Other treatment strategies, such as vaccines, require several weeks for immunity to manifest, which can significantly impact growth potential. Often, several treatment products are used in combination, increasing costs in an industry already facing heavy inflationary pressures. As a result, the poultry industry is actively searching for a novel solution.

Our treatment alternative represents an innovative new product class that aims to strengthen the immune system of chickens through multiple complementary immune pathways to afford a rapid, robust, and effective response to disease-causing pathogens without the adverse effects associated with traditional antimicrobial drugs and chemicals.

Agtech Business Strategy

For the agtech side of our business, we have developed our proprietary algal culture to be commercially viable as a nutritional product. The powdered form contains approximately 45% protein, is an excellent source of other essential nutrients, and is nearly completely odorless and tasteless unlike other algal products. As we reviewed our agtech business early this year, we were very satisfied with the nature of the product; however, we identified gaps in customer acquisition and in scale-up technology preventing us from growing our proprietary algae in quantities to sufficiently meet the potential demand. We have, therefore, focused our agtech strategy on developing a cost effective, commercial-scale growing technology.

In 2021, we began funding a development agreement with Grupo Alimenta, a well-established Peruvian agriculture company. Our focus is now on scaling up for commercial production. The Alimenta-ZIVO team has been working toward building commercial-scale algae ponds using a ZIVO proprietary design, and we are in the middle of a project to grow our algae in a penultimate scale pond. 

Given the Self Affirmed GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status for our dried whole algal biomass product, we intend to work with partners and wholesale buyers with the goal to generate revenue in 2023.

Today’s algae industry is artisanal and fragmented. There is no major source that can deliver to national brands and co-packers consistent quality and quantity of dried algae, and we aim to fill that market need with our proprietary algae.

Additional Indications

Pending additional funding, ZIVO may also pursue the following indications:

Biotech: 


o | Bovine Mastitis: ZIVO is developing a treatment, for bovine mastitis based on previous successful proof of concept studies and derived from its proprietary algal culture and the bioactive agents contained within. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Canine Joint Health: Studies have indicated the potential of a chondroprotective property when a compound fraction from ZIVO’s algal culture was introduced into ex vivo canine joint tissues. 
o | Human Immune Modulation: Early human immune cell in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that one of the isolated and characterized biologically active molecules in the Company’s portfolio may serve as an immune modulator with potential application in multiple disease situations.

Agtech: 


o | Human Food Ingredient: The self-affirmed GRAS process was completed for ZIVO algal biomass in late 2018 to validate its suitability for human consumption as an ingredient in foods and beverages. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Skin Health: ZIVO is developing its algal biomass as a skin health ingredient, with topical skin product testing started in the third quarter of 2020, and clinical efficacy claim studies planned for ingestible and topical products.

Our Market Opportunity 

Biotech

Livestock and Companion Animal Health

The annual market sizes for vaccines, phytogenics and eubiotics in the animal health market as a whole were approximately $9.2 billion in 2020, $753.0 million in 2020, and $3.9 billion in 2019, respectively. During the same time period, the annual market sizes for drugs, vaccines & feed additives and supplements in the companion animal market were approximately $11.8 billion in 2020 and $637.6 million in 2019, respectively. 
Poultry Gut Health

Coccidiosis, or the inflammation of the intestinal tract, is one of the largest health and animal welfare problems facing poultry flocks. Consumer and regulatory pressure have created what we believe to be an opportunity to develop and market an alternative to various additives routinely mixed into chicken feed. The Company is developing a product candidate designed to boost immune response, thereby combatting a broad range of infective pathogens, with the goal of simultaneously improving feed conversion and productivity. 
Bovine Mastitis

Bovine mastitis, or inflammation of the udder, can halt milk production and may result in unsaleable milk. The U.S. cow herd averaged 9.4 million cows in 2018 and U.S. milk production hit 217.6 billion pounds in 2018. Bovine mastitis affects approximately 1.5 million out of the 9 million dairy cows in the U.S. on an annual basis, and the average loss per cow per year in milk output is 846 pounds. Current treatments are primarily antibiotic, which requires a holding period and disposal of milk during that holding period. 
Canine Joint Health

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common ailments among pet dogs, with prevalence believed to be greater than 20%. The U.S. is expected to hold the largest share of the global market for veterinary pain management due to the vast pet population in the region, increasing animal healthcare expenditure, large number of hospitals and clinics, growing pool of veterinarians, and high prevalence of diseases causing pain. According to IBISWorld, the U.S. veterinary services market showed a solid, steady increase in consumer spending over the past few years.
Human Immune Modification

Immune-related and infectious diseases represent a vast range of health issues affecting millions of humans. New applications in pharma, food and nutraceuticals are continually introduced into this growing market. The annual market sizes for the antibiotics, eubiotics, autoimmune, and the antidiabetic markets were approximately $40.0 billion in 2020, $37.9 billion in 2019, $110.0 billion in 2017 and $48.8 billion in 2018, respectively. Beyond arthritis, there are more than 80 types of clinically different autoimmune diseases. Many major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies have extensive licensing and development programs focused on autoimmune/anti-inflammatory R&D. The rise in strategic alliances by discovery stage R&D companies like ZIVO is one of the latest trends that may gain traction in the autoimmune and anti-inflammatory therapeutics market in the coming years.

Agtech 

Human Functional Food Ingredients

The market for healthy foods, health foods, vegan and vegetarian food products continues to gain traction in the US and worldwide, especially as consumers look for healthful and nutritional ingredients to improve overall health and immune response. The drive toward plant-based proteins and microbiome-enhancing natural foods and food/beverage ingredients and dietary supplements continues to expand.
Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway

Clinical Experience, Future Development and Clinical Trial Plans

Our product candidates are at different stages of development for different applications. Accordingly, the various regulatory processes required for the various applications are at different stages of completion. With respect to human food and beverage applications, we have completed the FDA’s self-affirmed GRAS process for our dried algal biomass which allows for product commercialization with a consumption limit of up to nine grams per day. 

Beyond use of the dried algal biomass in human food and beverage in the U.S. with nutritional claims, ZIVO has not yet received the required approvals for commercialization for any product form or application. To date, however, we have performed a number of studies required by regulatory bodies including bench top and pre-clinical tests (which include animal testing, performance, and other tests) for various product forms and applications pertinent to qualified health claims and structure/function claims. As described below, the Company intends to perform additional testing of its products in connection with obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals.

Poultry Gut Health

We are actively developing a product candidate targeting poultry gut health. We have conducted 21 clinical trials to date, most recently in the first half of 2022. The early studies focused on determining the general effects of various product candidates, while the more recent studies have been focused on optimizing a single lead product candidate including study of dosage levels, interactions with vaccines and various product formulations. 

In late 2022, a third party performed a four-month study on behalf of a potential partner company, which included a 42-day coccidiosis trial in broiler chickens. That study evaluating the Company's novel immune-modulating biologic for treating coccidiosis in broiler chickens produced questionable results due to a high disease burden among tested chickens. The Company has already begun the process to conduct a new study that it expects to be completed by mid-2023. 

ZIVO’s approach for developing our coccidiosis product candidate as feed additives enables us to generate products that boost the immune response and reduce the effects of disease, while maintaining a single regulatory relationship, which is with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

We recently announced receipt of a letter from the USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) affirming that the agency has claimed jurisdiction for reviewing our immune-modulating biologic for treating coccidiosis in broiler chickens. This important jurisdictional announcement de-risks our regulatory path and opens the door to further discussions with the CVB on the final product development plan, regulatory strategy, and data requirements for licensure. This was a significant milestone as USDA approval is likely to provide a favorable timeline to approval relative to the alternative involving the FDA.

Potential Additional Indications

Following development of our initial product candidate for poultry gut health, the Company intends to continue to pursue the below indications:

Material Agreements

Zoetis Collaboration/Option Agreement 

On December 20, 2013, the Company entered into a collaboration, confidentiality and option agreement with Zoetis (as amended from time to time, the “Zoetis Agreement”), formerly Pfizer Animal Health, and the world’s largest animal health company, pursuant to which the Company is conducting bovine mastitis research. 

Under the Zoetis Agreement, the Company granted Zoetis an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with the Company for Company proprietary technology for bovine mastitis, including its identified and characterized natural molecule and its synthetic fatty acid/polysaccharide complex, and derivatives/homologs/isomers thereof, and production of the same (the “Technology”). The Company is required to execute a study under the supervision of Zoetis, the results of which will be used by Zoetis to evaluate whether or not to exercise its option. Within 90 days of its receipt of results, Zoetis must notify the Company whether or not it wishes to secure an exclusive license, and the negotiation of such license and payment terms will be made at that time.

The Zoetis Agreement has been extended through seven amendments, with the current term set to expire on January 30, 2023. 

NutriQuest Collaborative Marketing Agreement 

In April 2017, the Company entered into a limited license agreement with animal nutrition innovator NutriQuest (the “NutriQuest Agreement”), which holds feed formulation contracts with Tyson, Purdue, Smithfield and other large poultry and pork processors around the world. Poultry feed testing has shown that the Company’s proprietary algal strain may be a natural immune modulator that may enter the market as a natural products of phytogenic feed ingredient, providing the No Antibiotics Ever (“NAE”) producers with a non-medicated feed alternative.

Under the NutriQuest Agreement, ZIVO granted to NutriQuest a limited, exclusive license to market, distribute sell and collect the sales proceeds in all ZIVO’s nutrition, feed additive and supplementation applications naturally-derived algal biomass and extraction products (collectively the “Products”) for oral administration in poultry and swine. The Products were to be sold under the NutriQuest brand, with logos and packaging chosen by NutriQuest, with NutriQuest marketing, distributing and collecting revenues from sales of the Products. The parties were to equally share the gross profit.

Additionally, if ZIVO had licensed its intellectual property to another party in the animal nutrition market (a “Competitive Product”), NutriQuest had the right to exercise either of the following two options: Market Adjustment Option: ZIVO would pay NutriQuest a market adjustment that is equal to 15% of the gross profit earned by ZIVO on the Competitive Product; and Put Option: NutriQuest had an option to terminate the NutriQuest Agreement and require ZIVO to pay NutriQuest a termination fee equal to three times NutriQuest’s 50% portion of the highest annualized gross profit achieved by NutriQuest in any 12 consecutive month period from inception of sales pursuant to the NutriQuest Agreement.

On May 1, 2022, the Company acknowledged that the NutriQuest Agreement was terminated pursuant to its terms.

NutriChipz Supply Agreement

In June 2018, ZIVO entered into an exclusive U.S.-only supply agreement with NutriChipz (the “NutriChipz Agreement”), which provided an exclusive license to NutriChipz to supply our algae as an ingredient in chips and crisps. Under the NutriChipz Agreement, Nutrichipz was to pay ZIVO an amount equal to 130% of the direct cost of ZIVO algal biomass at a US port of entry; provided, however, that such cost were not to exceed $15,000 per metric ton. The NutriChipz Agreement had a term of five years, subject to up to two additional two-year terms at the election of NutriChipz. However, if at any point after the date that was 12 months following the first delivery by ZIVO of two tons of its product to Nutrichipz at an average price per ton of no more than $8,000, Nutrichipz failed to purchase at monthly cumulative average of at least 10 tons of product, then ZIVO would be released from the exclusivity obligations. Additionally, either party was able to terminate the NutriChipz Agreement if the other party breached the Nutrichipz Agreement, and did not cure such breach within 90 days, or upon certain insolvency, bankruptcy events of the other party.

On September 28, 2022, the NutriChipz Agreement was terminated by the parties. Upon termination of the NutriChipz Agreement, ZIVO granted NutriChipz a four (4) year right of first refusal (“NutriChipzROFR”) (commencing on September 28, 2022) should ZIVO (or its affiliate or subsidiary) intend to sell its algae biomass to an unrelated party in an arm’s length transaction as an ingredient for human consumption in any of the following:

Patents

The term of individual patents and patent applications will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or parent application, if applicable). For example, if an international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application is filed, any patent issuing from the PCT application in a specific country expires 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application. In the United States, using the Paris Convention route, if a patent was in force on June 8, 1995, or issued on an application that was filed before June 8, 1995, that patent will have a term that is the greater of 20 years from the filing date, or 17 years from the date of issue.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension (“PTE”). PTE permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug (IND) and the submission date of a biological license application (“BLA”) plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our therapeutic candidates and products and their methods of use.

Trade Secrets

We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be. Our agreements with our employees prohibit them from providing us with any intellectual property or proprietary information of third parties. We also generally require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements with third parties that receive or have access to our confidential information, data or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties that have access to our confidential proprietary information will abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property and confidential information, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information.
Government Regulation

Overview

Biotech

As a discovery-stage licensor, we do not intend to fund and oversee the final regulatory approvals and commercialization processes of our product candidates, as we expect these to be borne by the licensee in all cases.
Agtech

As the licensor of food technology, and producer of culture inoculum for cultivation, ZIVO and its licensed growers must furnish to customers algal biomass that is compliant with all food standards and FDA regulations. In all cases, the compliance efforts involve GRAS affirmation and potentially an FDA “No Objection” or “No Questions” letter for each target specie. ZIVO has already obtained self-affirmed GRAS status for human use.
Feed Ingredients & Supplements - Companion Animals

Although state and AAFCO officials regulate companion animal feeds, treats and supplements, the supervision and standards are largely handled by the FDA and the CVM on a national level. We currently do not have approval to sell companion animal feed ingredients since we must first develop the specie-specific safety and health data required to do so. Companion animal products are aimed primarily at dogs and horses. We believe that a single safety/tox study and a separate dose/benefit study per animal applications will be sufficient. As with humans, we would seek to obtain a GRAS affirmation.

To clarify, an “application” is a single ingredient in a single formulation and a single claim for a single animal species. Therefore, a dietary supplement derived from the Company’s algal biomass, intended as a joint health supplement for adult dogs, constitutes a single application. That single application requires its own studies before any dog treat manufacturer would consider licensing or purchasing the Company’s material. Any change to the claims (more energy, shinier coat, etc.) or the target specie requires a new study. This is the current state of regulation, and it holds true for all human and animal applications.

Food Ingredient - Human

The food ingredient industry is regulated by several federal agencies. Anything that is introduced into food or beverages, whether to prevent spoilage, optimize processing or to enhance its nutritive value, must meet standards set and enforced rigorously by the FDA and USDA.

GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe)

The FDA requires that ingredients introduced into human foods and beverages are safe and are manufactured in a consistent manner that guarantees consumer safety. The standard that the Company must meet for food ingredient safety is GRAS. The Company opted to self-affirm GRAS status for its algal biomass, and upon completion in November 2018 of the self-affirmation process, the biomass may be used as a food ingredient. The Company may submit the self-affirmed GRAS reportto the FDA in expectation the agency will respond to the Company noting “no questions” concerning our data.

In 2016, ZIVO contracted the Burdock Group to assist the Company in the compliance process, and to help with the process with the FDA. Further, the Company retained the New York law firm of Ullman Shapiro Ullman LLP, now part of Rivkin-Radler LLP, to advise in the compliance process.

Current Good Manufacturing Process

The other set of standards that must be met before any ingredient can be introduced into foods and beverages are the current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”). The Company is required to register as a producer of food and/or dietary supplement ingredients with FDA and will thus be subject to inspection by the agency for compliance with applicable cGMP regulations.

In addition, there are numerous state and local licensing and inspection requirements should the product be produced in the U.S. If produced overseas, the FDA, USDA and U.S. Customs require that each grower is enrolled in the Foreign Supplier Verification Program, a cost to be borne by the grower and ZIVO.

Dietary Supplements

Dietary supplements, which include vitamins, minerals, nutritive substances, and natural products that are standalone products (“nutraceuticals”) fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA and must comply with the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (“DSHEA”) legislation passed in 1994 and updated several times since, along with the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011.

NDI Application

As human dietary supplement applications are being readied for market launch, the Company is required to file a New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) Notification. The standard applied to NDI Notifications is “reasonable expectation of safety” for intended use as a supplement. As part of the notification process, ZIVO must conduct at least one human study, and possibly two. These studies can run concurrently but should not be conducted by the same clinical research organization. To date, ZIVO has not run these studies. One such study may be the same dose tolerance study planned to increase the maximum allowable consumption limit as discussed above.

Skin Care and Topical Uses

The US Congress is contemplating implementation of a statute requiring all skin care and cosmetics production to follow cGMP. If this legislation is passed the Company will need to ensure that it and any contract manufacturers are certified to be cGMP compliant.

Structure/Function Claims

The Company can go to market (once a single study has been completed and GMP protocols are in evidence) with simple structure/function claims regarding the ability to maintain, for example, a healthy immune response or a beneficial anti-inflammatory response. This is the most basic of FDA standards and essentially means that as long as cGMP standards are met, a study has been conducted and that in-process toxicology reports are available, the Company is able to market its product.

The market reality is that nutraceutical and supplement makers won’t take on the product unless its chemical makeup is generally described, the plant or animal is properly classified (in this case, algae) and the manufacturing process is free of health hazards and that cGMP protocols are observed, all of which the Company intends to meet or exceed.


18


USP Certification

The DSHEA regulations also require that a safe dosage is established for any vitamin, mineral or dietary supplement, whether it is natural or synthetic in composition. The United States Pharmacopeia (“USP”) is the official pharmacopeia of the United States. USP establishes written (documentary) and physical (reference) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products and ingredients. 

These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency. The Company will endeavor to adhere to the most basic USP standard in order to maintain speed to market. It or its licensees will then consider the USP Verified products designation.

Employees

As of December 31, 2022 we had 8 full-time employees, consisting of clinical development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, finance, administration and managers. We also regularly use independent contractors across the organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Corporate Information 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 28, 1983, under the name of “L. Peck Enterprises, Inc.” On May 27, 1999, we changed our name to “Western Glory Hole, Inc.” From 1990 until October 2003, we had no business operations; we were in the development stage and were seeking profitable business opportunities. On October 30, 2003, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Health Enhancement Corporation (“HEC”) in exchange for 112,500 of our shares, making HEC our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with this transaction, we changed our name to Health Enhancement Products, Inc. On October 14, 2014, at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, a proposal was passed to change the name of the Company from Health Enhancement Products, Inc. to Zivo Bioscience, Inc. On October 30, 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved the name Zivo Bioscience, Inc. for trading purposes and the symbol change to ZIVO effective November 10, 2014.
