 Item 1 – Business
 Overview; Recent Events
 Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (“Omega”) was formed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and incorporated in the State of Maryland on March 31, 1992.  All of Omega's assets are owned directly or indirectly, and all of Omega's operations are conducted directly or indirectly, through its subsidiary, OHI Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership (“Omega OP”).  Omega OP was formed as a limited partnership and organized in the State of Delaware on October 24, 2014.  Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” means Omega and Omega OP, collectively.
 The Company has one reportable segment consisting of investments in healthcare-related real estate properties located in the United States (“U.S.”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).  Our core business is to provide financing and capital to the long-term healthcare industry with a particular focus on skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), and, to a lesser extent, assisted living facilities (“ALFs”), independent living facilities (“ILFs”) and rehabilitation and acute care facilities.  Our core portfolio consists of long-term leases and mortgage agreements.  All of our leases are “triple-net” leases, which require the operators (we use the term “operator” to refer to our tenants and mortgagors and their affiliates who manage and/or operate our properties) to pay all property-related expenses.  Our mortgage revenue derives from fixed rate mortgage loans, which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.
 Omega OP is governed by the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of OHI Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership, dated as of April 1, 2015 (the “Partnership Agreement”).  Omega has exclusive control over Omega OP’s day-to-day management pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.  As of December 31, 2018, Omega owned approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding units of partnership interest in Omega OP (“Omega OP Units”), and investors owned approximately 4% of the outstanding Omega OP Units.
 In 2018, we completed the following transactions totaling approximately $471 million in new investments:

· | $131.3 million secured term loan with an unrelated third party. The loan is secured by a collateral assignment of mortgages covering seven SNFs, three ILFs, and one ALF located in Pennsylvania and Virginia. The loan bears an interest rate of 9.35%. On or before its maturity in 2019, we expect to obtain fee simple title to the facilities and add the facilities to an existing operator’s master lease. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $44.2 million first mortgage loan with an existing operator of ours. The loan is secured by five SNFs with 522 beds located in Michigan. The loan is cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with our existing loans and master lease with the operator. The loan bears an initial annual interest rate of 9.5%, which rate increases each year by 0.225%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $35.1 million of new investments with an existing operator. The investment included the acquisition of three SNFs and one ILF from an unrelated third party. The four Pennsylvania facilities with 420 beds were added to an existing operator’s master lease with an initial cash yield of 9.5% with 2.5% annual rent escalators. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $9.1 million of new investments with an existing operator in the U.K. The investments included two care homes (similar to ALFs in the U.S.) acquired from an unrelated third party and leased to an existing operator. The two care homes were added to the existing operator’s master lease with an initial annual cash yield of 8.5% with 2.5% annual escalators. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We also acquired nine SNFs and one ALF for approximately $60.7 million throughout the U.S. and invested an additional $10.0 million in an existing $50.0 million mezzanine loan. The annual interest rate was fixed at 12.0% per annum and the maturity date of the mezzanine loan was extended to May 2023.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $180.9 million of investments in our capital expenditure programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of investments included 924 healthcare facilities located in 41 states and the U.K. and operated by 68 third-party operators and was made up of the following:

· | 735 SNFs, 116 ALFs, 14 specialty facilities and one medical office building;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fixed rate mortgages on 51 SNFs and three ALFs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | four facilities closed or held for sale.
--+-----------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2018, our investments in these facilities, net of impairments and reserves for uncollectible loans, totaled approximately $8.6 billion.  In addition, we held other investments of approximately $504.6 million, consisting primarily of secured loans to third-party operators of our facilities and a $31.0 million investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
 On January 2, 2019, Omega and Omega OP entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc. (“MedEquities”) and its subsidiary operating partnership and the general partner of its subsidiary operating partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Omega will acquire MedEquities and MedEquities will be merged with and into Omega (the “Merger”) at the effective time of the Merger with Omega continuing as the surviving company. At the effective time, each outstanding share of MedEquities common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.235 of a share of Omega common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $2.00 in cash, without interest, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement under certain limited circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the total consideration expected to be exchanged in the merger, including the assumption of debt is approximately $600 million.  The Merger Agreement also provides that MedEquities will declare a special dividend of $0.21 per share of MedEquities common stock (the “Pre-Closing Dividend”) payable to the holders of record of MedEquities common stock as of the trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, which dividend will be payable following the effective time of the Merger together with the cash consideration under the Merger Agreement.

      Description of the Business
 Investment Strategy. We maintain a portfolio of long-term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located in the U.S. and the U.K. Our investments are generally geographically diverse and operated by a diverse group of established, middle‑market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management and creditworthiness. Our criteria for evaluating potential investments includes but is not limited to:
 the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility;
 the facility’s historical and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs, capital expenditure requirements and lease or debt service obligations;
 the construction quality, condition and design of the facility;
 the location of the facility;
 the tax, growth, regulatory and reimbursement environment of the applicable jurisdiction;
 the occupancy rate for the facility and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities; and
 the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients at the facility.
 We seek to obtain (i) contractual rent escalations under long-term, non-cancelable, “triple-net” leases and (ii) fixed-rate mortgage loans. We typically obtain substantial liquidity deposits, covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth, liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets, and various provisions for cross-default, cross-collateralization and corporate and or personal guarantees, when appropriate.
 We prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties. Due to regulatory, tax or other considerations, we may pursue alternative investment structures. The following summarizes our primary investment structures. The average annualized yields described below reflect existing contractual arrangements. However, due to the nature of the long-term care industry, we cannot assure that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due. Therefore, the annualized yields as of December 31, 2018, set forth below, are not necessarily indicative of future yields, which may be lower.

 Triple-Net Operating Leases. Triple-net operating leases typically range from 5 to 15 years, plus renewal options. Our leases generally provide for minimum annual rentals that are subject to annual formula increases based on factors such as increases in the Consumer Price Index. At December 31, 2018, our average annualized yield from operating leases was approximately 9.2%.
 Direct Financing Leases. In addition to our typical lease agreements, three of our leases are being accounted for as direct financing leases with annual escalators. At December 31, 2018, our average annualized yield from the direct financing leases was approximately 9.0% (excluding our investments with Orianna Health Systems).
 Fixed-Rate Mortgages. Our mortgages typically have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor. At December 31, 2018, our average annualized yield on these investments was approximately 10.1%.
 The table set forth in Item 2 – Properties contains information regarding our properties and investments as of December 31, 2018.
 Borrowing Policies. We generally attempt to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets and employ long-term, fixed-rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time.
 We may use the proceeds of new indebtedness to finance our investments in additional healthcare facilities. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans, secured by mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.
 Policies With Respect To Certain Activities. With respect to our capital requirements, we typically rely on equity offerings, debt financing and retention of cash flow (subject to provisions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) concerning taxability of undistributed REIT taxable income), or a combination of these methods. Our financing alternatives include bank borrowings, publicly or privately placed debt instruments, purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets or securitizations, any of which may be issued as secured or unsecured indebtedness.
 We have the authority to issue our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our securities.
 Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
 We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. We do not underwrite the securities of other issuers.
 Our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders. In the opinion of our management, our properties are adequately covered by insurance.
 Competition. The healthcare industry is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive in the future. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us. We believe our use of data analytics to assist our operators in enhancing their operations provides us a competitive advantage. Our operators compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services. The basis of competition for our operators includes the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population and surrounding areas.
 Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends.

 Taxation of Omega
 The following is a general summary of the material United States federal income tax considerations applicable to (i) us, (ii) the holders of our securities and (iii) our election to be taxed as a REIT. It is not tax advice. This summary is not intended to represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to a particular holder of our securities in view of any person’s particular circumstances, nor is it intended to represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to holders of our securities subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, securities broker-dealers, non-U.S. persons, persons holding our securities as part of a hedge, straddle, or other risk reduction, constructive sales or conversion transaction, investors in pass-through entities, expatriates and taxpayers subject to alternative minimum taxation. 
 The following discussion, to the extent it constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions (assuming the facts, representations and assumptions upon which the discussion is based are accurate), represents some of the material United States federal income tax considerations relevant to ownership of our securities. The sections of the Code relating to the qualification and operation as a REIT are highly technical and complex. The following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of those sections. The information in this section is based on, and is qualified in its entirety by the Code; the Tax Act (as defined in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below); current, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) promulgated under the Code; the legislative history of the Code; current administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”); and court decisions, in each case, as of the date of this report. In addition, the administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS, except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings.  For purposes of the discussion below, the “Highest Regular Corporate Tax Rate” means 21% for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and 35% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018.
 General. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1992. We believe that we were organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.  Omega OP is a pass through entity for United States federal income tax purposes.

     If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. However, we will be subject to certain federal income taxes as follows.  First, we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed REIT taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains; provided, however, that if we have a net capital gain, we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our undistributed REIT taxable income, computed without regard to net capital gain and the deduction for capital gains dividends, plus a 21% (35% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018) tax on undistributed net capital gain, if our tax as thus computed is less than the tax computed in the regular manner. Second, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, under certain circumstances, we may have been subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our stockholders. Third, if we have (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property,” which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to tax at the Highest Regular Corporate Tax Rate on such income. Fourth, if we have net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, certain sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business by us, (i.e., when we are acting as a dealer), such income will be subject to a 100% tax. Fifth, if we should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (as discussed below), but nonetheless have maintained our qualification as a REIT because certain other remedial requirements have been met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the 75% or 95% test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. Sixth, if we should fail to distribute by the end of each year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed. Seventh, we will be subject to a 100% excise tax on transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. Eighth, if we acquire any asset that is defined as a “built-in gain asset” from a C corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., generally a corporation subject to full corporate-level tax) in a transaction in which the basis of the built-in gain asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset (or any other property) in the hands of the C corporation, and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset (for dispositions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016) during the 5-year period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us (such period, the “recognition period”), then, to the extent of the built-in gain (i.e., the excess of (a) the fair market value of such asset on the date such asset was acquired by us over (b) our adjusted basis in such asset on such date), our recognized gain will be subject to tax at the Highest Regular Corporate Tax Rate. The results described above with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that we will not make an election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-7(c)(5). 
 Requirements for Qualification. The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: (1) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (3) which would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (4) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company as defined in provisions of the Code; (5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; (6) during the last half year of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities); and (7) which meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its annual distributions to stockholders. The Code provides that conditions (1) to (4) inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of twelve months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in the case of condition (6). We may avoid disqualification as a REIT for a failure to satisfy any of these tests if such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure.
 Income Tests. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including generally “rents from real property,” interest on mortgages on real property, and gains on sale of real property and real property mortgages, other than property described in Section 1221(a)(1) of the Code) and income derived from certain types of temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.

     Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” in satisfying the gross income requirements for a REIT described above only if several conditions are met. First, the amount of the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the net income or profits of any person. However, any amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales. Second, the Code provides that rents received from a tenant (other than rent from a tenant that is a TRS that meets the requirements described below) will not qualify as “rents from real property” in satisfying the gross income tests if we, or an owner (actually or constructively) of 10% or more of the value of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of such tenant, which is defined as a related party tenant taking into account certain complex attribution rules. Third, if rent attributable to personal property, leased in connection with a lease of real property, is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.” Finally, for rents received to qualify as “rents from real property,” we generally must not operate or manage the property, or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property, other than through an independent contractor from which we derive no revenue. We may, however, directly perform certain services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant” of the property. In addition, we may directly provide a minimal amount of “non-customary” services to the tenants of a property as long as our income from the services does not exceed 1% of our income from the related property. Furthermore, we may own up to 100% of the stock of a TRS, which may provide customary and non-customary services to our tenants without tainting our rental income from the related properties. 
 The term “interest” generally does not include any amount received or accrued (directly or indirectly) if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the net income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales. In addition, an amount that is based on the net income or profits of a debtor will be qualifying interest income as long as the debtor derives substantially all of its income from the real property securing the debt from leasing substantially all of its interest in the property, but only to the extent that the amounts received by the debtor would be qualifying “rents from real property” if received directly by a REIT.

 If a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the borrower’s gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the property’s value as of a specific date, income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan, which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. 
 Interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property generally is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. However, if the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to originate or acquire the loan, a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. The portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property.  Prior to January 1, 2016, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, an allocation of the interest received between qualified mortgage interest and interest that was not qualified mortgage interest on the loan was required to be made if the fair market value of the real property at the time the loan was made was less than the principal amount of the loan.  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, such allocation is required only if the fair market value of the personal property exceeds 15% of the value of the property.  We do not expect the change in the rules for allocation of mortgage interest to have an impact on our ability to satisfy either of the gross income tests going forward.  
 A modification of a mortgage loan, if it is deemed significant for income tax purposes, could be considered to be the deemed issuance of a new mortgage loan that is subject to re-testing under these rules, with the possible re-characterization of the mortgage interest on such loan as non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (but not the 95% gross income test, which is discussed below), as well as non-qualifying assets under the asset test (discussed below) and the deemed exchange of the modified loan for the new loan could result in imposition of the 100% prohibited transaction tax (also discussed below). IRS guidance provides relief in the case of certain existing mortgage loans held by a REIT that are modified in response to these market conditions such that (i) the modified mortgage loan need not be re-tested for purposes of determining whether the income from the mortgage loan continues to be qualified income for purposes of the 75% gross income test or whether the mortgage loan retains its character as a qualified REIT asset for purposes of the asset test (discussed below), and (ii) the modification of the loan will not be treated as a prohibited transaction. At present, we do not hold any mortgage loans that have been modified, which would require us to take advantage of these rules for special relief.  We monitor our mortgage loans and direct financing leases for compliance with the above rules.
 Prohibited Transactions. We will incur a 100% tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property, other than foreclosure property, that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. We believe that none of our assets is primarily held for sale to customers and that a sale of any of our assets would not be in the ordinary course of our business. Whether a REIT holds an asset primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends, however, on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time, including those related to a particular asset.  The Code provides a set of “safe-harbor provisions,” which, if met, generally will exempt a sale or disposition of property by us from being subject to the 100% tax on sales to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business.  In connection with the sale of any of our assets, we generally attempt to comply with the terms of safe-harbor provisions in the Code so as to minimize the risk that a sale of property by us would be characterized as a prohibited transaction and subject to the 100% tax on any gain from such sale. The Code also provides a number of alternative exceptions from the 100% tax on “prohibited transactions” if certain requirements have been satisfied with respect to property disposed of by a REIT. These requirements relate primarily to the number and/or amount of properties disposed of by a REIT, the period of time the property has been held by the REIT, and/or aggregate expenditures made by the REIT with respect to the property being disposed of. The conditions needed to meet these requirements have been lowered several times through amendments to the Code. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with the safe-harbor provisions or that we would be able to avoid the 100% tax on prohibited transactions if we were to dispose of an owned property that otherwise may be characterized as property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

 Foreclosure Property. We will be subject to tax at the Highest Regular Corporate Tax Rate on any income from foreclosure property, other than income that otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, less expenses directly connected with the production of that income. However, gross income from foreclosure property is treated as qualifying for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Foreclosure property is any real property, including interests in real property, and any personal property incident to such real property: 

· | that is acquired by a REIT as the result of (i) the REIT having bid on such property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after there was a default, or (ii) default was imminent on a lease of such property or on indebtedness that such property secured;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the REIT at a time when the default was not imminent or anticipated; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | for which the REIT makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Such property generally ceases to be foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the REIT acquired the property, or longer (for a total of up to six years) if an extension is granted by the Secretary of the Treasury. In the case of a “qualified health care property” acquired solely as a result of termination of a lease, but not in connection with default or an imminent default on the lease, the initial grace period terminates on the second (rather than the third) taxable year following the year in which the REIT acquired the property (unless the REIT establishes the need for and the Secretary of the Treasury grants one or more extensions, not exceeding six years in total, including the original two-year period, to provide for the orderly leasing or liquidation of the REIT’s interest in the qualified health care property). This grace period terminates and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day: 

· | on which a lease is entered into for the property that, by its terms, will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test, or any amount is received or accrued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | on which any construction takes place on the property, other than completion of a building or any other improvement, where more than 10% of the construction was completed before default became imminent; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | which is more than 90 days after the day on which the REIT acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business that is conducted by the REIT, other than through an independent contractor from whom the REIT itself does not derive or receive any income or, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, through a TRS.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The definition of foreclosure property includes any “qualified health care property,” as defined in Code Section 856(e)(6) acquired by us as the result of the termination or expiration of a lease of such property. We have from time to time operated qualified healthcare facilities acquired in this manner for up to two years (or longer if an extension was granted). However, we do not currently own any property with respect to which we have made foreclosure property elections.  Properties that we had taken back in a foreclosure or bankruptcy and operated for our own account were treated as foreclosure properties for income tax purposes, pursuant to Code Section 856(e). Gross income from foreclosure properties was classified as “good income” for purposes of the annual REIT income tests upon making the election on the tax return. Once made, the income was classified as “good” for a period of three years, or until the properties were no longer operated for our own account. In all cases of foreclosure property, we utilized an independent contractor to conduct day-to-day operations to comply with certain REIT requirements. In certain cases, we operated these facilities through a taxable REIT subsidiary. For those properties operated through the taxable REIT subsidiary, we utilized an eligible independent contractor to conduct day-to-day operations to comply with certain REIT requirements. As a result of the foregoing, we do not believe that our participation in the operation of nursing homes increased the risk that we would fail to qualify as a REIT. Through our 2017 taxable year, we had not paid any tax on our foreclosure property because those properties had been producing losses.  We cannot predict whether, in the future, our income from foreclosure property will be significant and whether we could be required to pay a significant amount of tax on that income.

     Hedging Transactions. Our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps and floors, options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts. To the extent that we enter into an interest rate swap or cap contract, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement, or any similar financial instrument for the purpose of hedging our indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry “real estate assets,” any periodic income or gain from the disposition of that contract should be qualifying income and excluded from the computations determining compliance with the 95% and 75% gross income tests.  As described in Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge our risk against fluctuations in interest rates and the swaps have been structured to satisfy the requirements of the tax treatment outlined above.  Accordingly, our income and gain from our interest rate swap agreements generally is qualifying income and may be excluded from our computations in determining compliance with the 95% and 75% gross income tests.  To the extent that we hedge with other types of financial instruments, or in other situations, it is not entirely clear how the income from those transactions will be treated for purposes of the gross income tests.  We believe that we have structured and intend to continue to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT.   
 TRS Income. A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. If a TRS owns directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock of another corporation, the other corporation also will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, the limitation on ownership of TRS stock was 25%).  After 2009, a TRS  was permitted to own or lease a health care facility provided that the facility is operated and managed by an “eligible independent contractor.” A TRS will pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. In addition, the new rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT or the REIT’s operators that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis.  As stated above, we do not lease any of our facilities to any of our TRSs.
 Failure to Satisfy Income Tests. If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain relief provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will be generally available if (1) our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, (2) we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our tax return, and (3) any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. Even if these relief provisions apply, we would incur a 100% tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which we fail the 75% and 95% gross income tests, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability and we would file a schedule with descriptions of each item of gross income that caused the failure. 
 Asset Tests. At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (including (i) our allocable share of real estate assets held by partnerships in which we own an interest and (ii) stock or debt instruments held for less than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long-term (at least five years) debt offering of our company), cash, cash items and government securities. Second, of our investments not included in the 75% asset class, the value of our interest in any one issuer’s securities may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. Third, we may not own more than 10% of the voting power or value of any one issuer’s outstanding securities. Fourth, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments.  Fifth, no more than 20% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more TRSs (25% in the case of  a taxable year beginning before  January 1, 2018). Sixth, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other non-TRS taxable subsidiaries, or  other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. 
 For purposes of the second and third asset tests described above the term “securities” does not include our equity or debt securities of a qualified REIT subsidiary, a TRS, or an equity interest in any partnership, since we are deemed to own our proportionate share of each asset of any partnership of which we are a partner. Furthermore, for purposes of determining whether we own more than 10% of the value of only one issuer’s outstanding securities, the term “securities” does not include: (i) any loan to an individual or an estate; (ii) any Code Section 467 rental agreement; (iii) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (iv) certain government issued securities; (v) any security issued by another REIT; and (vi) our debt securities in any partnership, not otherwise excepted under (i) through (v) above, (A) to the extent of our interest as a partner in the partnership or (B) if 75% of the partnership’s gross income is derived from sources described in the 75% income test set forth above.

 We may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. However, overall, no more than 20% (or 25% with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018) of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other non-TRS taxable subsidiaries (including stock in non-REIT C corporations) and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test.  We believe that the value of our TRSs is substantially less than 20% of the value of our assets and we do not expect the value of our TRSs to increase materially in the future. 
 If the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan, a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the 75% test. The nonqualifying portion of that mortgage loan will be equal to the portion of the loan amount that exceeds the value of the associated real property.  Prior to January 1, 2016, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, a portion of the mortgage loan was required to be treated as a nonqualifying assets for purposes of the 75% tests if the fair market value of the real property at the time the loan was made was less than the principal amount of the loan.  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, such allocation is required only if the fair market value of the personal property exceeds 15% of the value of the property.  We do not expect the change in the rules for allocation of mortgage interest to have an impact on our ability to satisfy either of the asset tests going forward.  As discussed under the 75% gross income test (see above), the IRS provided relief from re-testing certain mortgage loans held by a REIT that have been modified as a result of the current distressed market conditions with respect to real property. At present, we do not hold any mortgage loans that have been modified, which would require us to take advantage of these rules for special relief.
 After initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a REIT for failure to satisfy any of the asset tests at the end of a subsequent quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values. If the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter, the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within 30 days after the close of that quarter. 
 Subject to certain de minimis exceptions, we may avoid REIT disqualification in the event of certain failures under the asset tests, provided that (i) we file a schedule with a description of each asset that caused the failure, (ii) the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) we dispose of the assets within 6 months after the last day of the quarter in which the identification of the failure occurred (or the requirements of the rules are otherwise met within such period) and (iv) we pay a tax on the failure equal to the greater of (A) $50,000 per failure and (B) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure for the period beginning on the date of the failure and ending on the date we dispose of the asset (or otherwise satisfy the requirements) multiplied by the Highest Corporate Tax Rate. 
 Annual Distribution Requirements. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of noncash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions are required to be made pro rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class, and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain, or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates. 
 Furthermore, if we fail to distribute during a calendar year, or by the end of January following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year, at least the sum of: 

· | 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | 95% of our REIT capital gain income for such year; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | any undistributed taxable income from prior periods,
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 

 
  12

 

 we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distribute. We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital gain we receive in a taxable year. If we so elect, we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the 4% excise tax described above. We have made, and we intend to continue to make, timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements. We may also be entitled to pay and deduct deficiency dividends in later years as a relief measure to correct errors in determining our taxable income. Although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, we will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends. 
 The availability to us of, among other things, depreciation deductions with respect to our owned facilities (which reduce our taxable income and the amount of our required dividend distributions) depends upon the determination that, for federal income tax purposes, we are the true owner of such facilities for federal income tax purposes, which is dependent on the classification of the leases to operators or our facilities as “true leases” rather than financing arrangements for federal income tax purposes. The determinations of whether (1) we are the owner of such facilities, and (2) the leases are true leases, for federal tax purposes are essentially factual matters.  With the exception of certain financing arrangements for federal income tax purposes, we believe that we will be treated as the owner of each of the facilities that we lease, and such leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes. However, no assurances can be given that the IRS will not successfully challenge our status as the owner of our facilities subject to leases, and the status of such leases as true leases, asserting that the purchase of the facilities by us and the leasing of such facilities merely constitute steps in secured financing transactions in which the lessees are owners of the facilities and we are merely a secured creditor. In such event, we would not be entitled to claim depreciation deductions with respect to any of the affected facilities.  Other changes included in the Tax Act that could impact the amount of our taxable income for our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, include the limitation of the deduction for interest expense, the limitation on the deduction for certain compensation paid to certain of our executive officers, and the changes to the Code expanding the definitions of “lobbying and political expenditures” and “fines, penalties, and other amounts” for purposes of determining whether expenditures of these types continue to qualify as ordinary and necessary trade or business expenses that may be deducted in computing taxable income.  Since we are engaged in a qualified real property trade or business, we may elect out of the limitations on the deduction for interest expenses.  If we determine the need to make such an election, we will be required to use a longer depreciable life for certain of our real property, which will reduce the amount we may claim currently as depreciation expense for purposes of computing our taxable income.  The result of any of the above could cause us to fail to meet the 90% distribution requirement or, if such requirement is met, we might be subject to corporate income tax or the 4% excise tax. 
 Reasonable Cause Savings Clause. We may avoid disqualification in the event of a failure to meet certain requirements for REIT qualification if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and if the REIT pays a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. This reasonable cause safe harbor is not available for failures to meet the 95% and 75% gross income tests or the assets tests.
 Failure to Qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and the reasonable cause relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible, and our failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividend income, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  However, in such a case, subject to certain limitations of the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends that we make, and in the case of an individual, trust, or an estate, dividends are treated the same as capital gain income, which currently is subject to a maximum income tax rate that is lower than regular income tax rates.  In addition, in the case of an individual, trust or an estate, to the extent such taxpayer’s unearned income (including dividends) exceeds certain threshold amounts, the Medicare Tax on unearned income also will apply to dividend income.  Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to such statutory relief. Failure to qualify could result in our incurring indebtedness or liquidating investments to pay the resulting taxes. 
 Our Subsidiaries. We own and operate a number of properties through subsidiaries and the classification of such subsidiaries varies for federal income tax purposes as described in this section. Some of the subsidiaries elected to be taxed as REITs beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2015. The stock of the REIT subsidiaries, and dividends received from the 

 
  13

 
REIT subsidiaries, will qualify under the asset tests and income tests, respectively, as described above, provided that such subsidiaries maintain their REIT qualification. 
 Some of the subsidiaries are classified as qualified REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to as QRSs.  Code Section 856(i) provides that a corporation that is a QRS shall not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary shall be treated as assets, liabilities and such items (as the case may be) of the REIT.  Thus, in applying the tests for REIT qualification described above, the QRSs will be ignored, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction, and credit of such QRSs will be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction, and credit.
 Some of the subsidiaries are classified as TRSs. As described above, a TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT; however, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs (25% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018). One or more of our TRSs hold a number of assets that cannot be owned directly by a REIT.  We believe that  the value of the securities of our TRSs is far less than the permitted percentage thresholds described in this section.
 Some of the subsidiaries are classified as partnerships. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership, such REIT is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable REIT qualification tests.  Thus, our proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, and items of income of any partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which we own an interest, directly or indirectly, will be treated as our assets and gross income for purposes of applying the various REIT qualification requirements.  See Tax Aspects of Our Investments in our Operating Partnership and Subsidiary Partnerships below.
 Tax Aspects of Investments in our Operating Partnership and Subsidiary Partnerships
 The following discussion summarizes certain federal income tax considerations applicable to our direct or indirect investments in our operating partnership and any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies that we form or acquire including such subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies that are treated as disregarded for income tax purposes (collectively, “Omega OP”). This discussion does not cover state or local tax laws or any federal tax laws other than income tax laws.
 Classification as Partnerships.  We will be entitled to include in our income our distributive share of each item of Omega OP’s income and to deduct our distributive share of each item of Omega OP’s expense or loss only if Omega OP is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership (or an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes if the entity is treated as having only one owner for federal income tax purposes) rather than as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. An unincorporated entity with at least two owners or members will be classified as a partnership, rather than as a corporation, for federal income tax purposes if it:

· | is treated as a partnership under the Treasury Regulations relating to entity classification (the “check-the-box regulations”); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | is not a “publicly-traded partnership.”
--+----------------------------------------

  Under the check-the-box regulations, an unincorporated entity with at least two owners or members may elect to be classified either as an association taxable as a corporation or as a partnership. If such an entity fails to make an election, it generally will be treated as a partnership (or an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes if the entity is treated as having only one owner for federal income tax purposes) for federal income tax purposes. Omega OP intends to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and will not elect to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation under the check-the-box regulations.

 A publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof.  A partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and thus, characterized as a publicly traded partnership that is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may nevertheless avoid characterization as a corporation for any taxable year if, for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1987, in which it was classified as a publicly traded partnership, 90% or more of the partnership’s gross income for such year consists of certain passive-type income, including real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, interest, and dividends (the “Qualifying Income Exception”). The Treasury Regulations provide limited safe harbors under which certain transfers of interests in the partnership may be ignored or not taken into account in the determination of whether a partnership’s interests are considered to be readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof (the “PTP Transfer Exceptions”). Omega OP’s partnership agreement contains provisions enabling its general partner to take such steps as are necessary or appropriate to prevent the issuance and transfers of interests in Omega OP that do not satisfy one of the PTP Transfer Exceptions, and thus, cause Omega OP to be treated as a publicly traded partnership.  To date, we believe that all transfers of Omega OP Units have satisfied one of the PTP Transfer Exceptions.  However, even if the transfers of Omega OP Units failed to qualify for any of the PTP Transfer Exceptions, and Omega OP was considered to be a publicly traded partnership, we believe that Omega OP would have sufficient qualifying income to satisfy the Qualifying Income Exception, and therefore, would not be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS that Omega OP will be classified as a partnership and not as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If for any reason the Omega OP were taxable as a corporation, rather than as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we likely would not be able to qualify as a REIT unless we qualified for certain relief provisions. See the discussions entitled “Failure to Satisfy Income Tests,” “Asset Tests” and “Failure to Qualify” set forth above. In addition, any change in a partnership’s status for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur tax liability without any related cash distribution. See Annual Distribution Requirements above. Further, items of income and deduction of such partnership would not pass through to its partners, and its partners would be treated as stockholders for tax purposes. Consequently, such partnership would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on its net income, and distributions to its partners would constitute dividends that would not be deductible in computing such partnership’s taxable income.
 Partners, Not the Partnerships, Subject to Tax. A partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes. Rather, we are required to take into account our allocable share of each item of Omega OP’s income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit for any taxable year of Omega OP ending within or with our taxable year, without regard to whether we have received or will receive any distribution from Omega OP.
 Partnership Allocations. Although a partnership agreement generally will determine the allocation of income and losses among partners, such allocations will be disregarded for tax purposes if they do not comply with the provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations governing partnership allocations. If an allocation is not recognized for federal income tax purposes, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners’ interests in the partnership, which will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item.
 Tax Allocations With Respect to Partnership Properties. Income, gain, loss, and deduction attributable to property that has appreciated or depreciated that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner such that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, respectively, the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution (the “704(c) Allocations”). The amount of such unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “built-in gain” or “built-in loss”, generally is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed property at the time of contribution and the adjusted tax basis of such property at the time of contribution (a “book-tax difference”). Allocations with respect to book-tax differences are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners. A book-tax difference attributable to depreciable property generally is decreased on an annual basis as a result of the allocation of depreciation deductions to the contributing partner for book purposes but not for tax purposes. The Treasury Regulations require entities taxed as partnerships to use a “reasonable method” for allocating items with respect to which there is a book-tax difference and outline several reasonable allocation methods.


 
  15

 

 Any gain or loss recognized by Omega OP on the disposition of contributed properties will be allocated first to the partners of Omega OP who contributed such properties to the extent of their built-in gain or loss on those properties for federal income tax purposes. The partners’ built-in gain or loss on such contributed properties will equal the difference between the partners’ proportionate share of the book value of those properties and the partners’ tax basis allocable to those properties at the time of the contribution as reduced for any decrease in the book-tax difference. Any remaining gain or loss recognized by Omega OP on the disposition of the contributed properties, and any gain or loss recognized by Omega OP on the disposition of the other properties, generally will be allocated among the partners in accordance with the partnership agreement, unless such allocations and agreement do not satisfy the requirements of applicable Treasury Regulations, in which case the allocation will be made in accordance with the partners’ interests in the partnership.
 Omega OP has, in the past, received contributions of properties having a “carryover” tax basis that is different from the basis of such properties as determined for book or financial accounting purposes. As a result, such properties had significant built-in gain or loss subject to Section 704(c) of the Code. As the general partner of Omega OP, we are required to account for the book-tax difference with respect to the properties contributed to Omega OP under a method approved by Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations, which could result in an allocation of an amount of taxable income from the ownership, or gain or loss from the disposition, of such properties by Omega OP to holders of OP units that contributed such properties that varies from allocations of financial accounting income or gain realized as a result of the ownership and/or disposition of such properties.
 Sale of a Partnership’s Property. Generally, any gain realized by a partnership on the sale of property held by the partnership for more than one year will be long-term capital gain, except for any portion of such gain that is treated as depreciation or cost recovery recapture. Our share of any gain realized by Omega OP on the sale of any property held by Omega OP as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of Omega OP’s trade or business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. Such prohibited transaction income also may have an adverse effect upon our ability to satisfy the income tests for REIT status. See Income Tests above. We do not presently intend to acquire or hold or to allow Omega OP to acquire or hold any property that represents inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of Omega OP’s trade or business.
 Government Regulation and Reimbursement    The healthcare industry is heavily regulated. Our operators are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from the adoption of new legislation, rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. The ultimate timing or effect of these changes, which may be applied retroactively, cannot be predicted. Changes in laws and regulations impacting our operators, in addition to regulatory non-compliance by our operators, can have a significant effect on the operations and financial condition of our operators, which in turn may adversely impact us. There is the potential that we may be subject directly to healthcare laws and regulations because of the broad nature of some of these regulations, such as the Anti-kickback Statute and False Claims Act among others. The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.
 Healthcare Reform.  A substantial amount of rules and regulations have been issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the “Healthcare Reform Law”). The Trump administration has brought several Congressional efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.  We expect additional rules, regulations and judicial interpretations in response to legal and other constitutional challenges to be issued that may materially affect our operators’ financial condition and operations.  Even if the Healthcare Reform Law is not ultimately amended or repealed, the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the Healthcare Reform Law. The ultimate composition and timing of any legislation enacted under the new administration that would impact the current implementation of the Healthcare Reform Law remains uncertain. Given the complexity of the Healthcare Reform Law and the substantial requirements for regulation thereunder, the impact of the Healthcare Reform Law on our operators or their ability to meet their obligations to us cannot be predicted, whether in its current form or as amended or repealed.

 Reform Requirements for Long-Term Care Facilities.  On October 4, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a final rule modifying the conditions of participation in Medicare and Medicaid for SNFs. CMS stated that the regulations, last updated in 1991, were “necessary to reflect the substantial advances that had been made over the past several years in the theory and practice of service delivery and safety” within long-term care. The extensive modifications require SNFs to implement new processes; make changes to current practices; and create new policies and procedures within a short timeframe to remain in compliance with their conditions for participation. Changes include provisions related to staff training, discharge planning, infection prevention and control programs, and pharmacy services, among others. While many of the regulations became effective on November 28, 2016, some of the regulations became effective in Phase 2 on November 28, 2017, with others becoming effective in Phase 3, beginning on November 28, 2019. CMS delayed for eighteen months the imposition of any fines for failure to implement Phase 2 of the new “Requirements of Participation” implemented in November 2017.  CMS also announced a freeze on the inspection star ratings for any surveys occurring between November 28, 2017 and November 27, 2018. CMS estimates the average cost for a SNF to implement the new regulations is estimated to be $62,900 the first year and $55,000 each year thereafter.  
 Reimbursement Generally. A significant portion of our operators’ revenue is derived from government-funded reimbursement programs, consisting primarily of Medicare and Medicaid. As federal and state governments continue to focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by government payors will likely continue, which may result in reductions in reimbursement at both the federal and state levels. Additionally, new and evolving payor and provider programs, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage, dual eligible, accountable care organizations, and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.  Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and/or reductions of reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.
 Medicaid.  State budgetary concerns, coupled with the implementation of rules under the Healthcare Reform Law, or prospective changes to the Healthcare Reform Law under the Trump administration, may result in significant changes in healthcare spending at the state level. Many states are currently focusing on the reduction of expenditures under their state Medicaid programs, which may result in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our operators. The need to control Medicaid expenditures by the states may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in Medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Since our operators’ profit margins on Medicaid patients are generally relatively low, more than modest reductions in Medicaid reimbursement or an increase in the number of Medicaid patients could adversely affect our operators’ results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could negatively impact us.
 The Healthcare Reform Law provided for Medicaid coverage to be expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, beginning January 1, 2014. While the federal government committed to paying the entire cost for Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016, the federal share declines to 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% in 2020 and subsequent years. Although the Supreme Court ruled on June 28, 2012 that states could not be required to expand Medicaid or risk losing federal funding of their existing Medicaid programs, as of January 4, 2019, thirty-seven (37) states including the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility with additional states continuing to consider expansion.
 Medicare.  On July 31, 2018, CMS issued a final rule regarding the fiscal year (“FY”) 2019 Medicare payment rates and quality payment programs for SNFs, which continues the trend of shifting Medicare payments from volume to value.  Proposed aggregate payments to SNFs, which became effective October 1, 2018 for FY 2019, are expected to increase by $820 million over FY 2017 payments. This reimbursement increase is attributable to a 2.4% market basket increase as required under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. As mandated by the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (“IMPACT Act”), the annual update is reduced by two percentage points for SNFs that fail to submit required quality data to CMS under the SNF Quality Reporting Program (“QRP”).  
 Payments to providers are being increasingly tied to quality and efficiency.  CMS finalized the previously proposed rule to replace the SNF PPS RUG-IV case-mix classification methodology with a new value-based Patient Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”).  The PDPM is designed to improve the incentives to treat the needs of the whole patient, rather on the volume of services the patient receives.  The PDPM will be effective October 1, 2019 (FY 2020) to allow time for education and training of SNFs in preparation for the new payment model.

 These prospective reimbursement changes as well as the value-based purchasing programs applicable to SNFs under the 2014 Protecting Access to Medicare Act, which became effective on October 1, 2018, could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ financial condition and operations, adversely impacting their ability to meet their obligations to us.
 In addition to Medicare payment rates, SNFs continue to be impacted by the “Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018,” which extended Medicare sequestration and Medicare reimbursement cuts to providers and plans by 2% across the board, for an additional two years through 2027. 
 Furthermore, while the exceptions review process for therapy caps stipulated by MACRA expired December 31, 2017, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 permanently repealed the therapy caps and the exceptions review process that applied to Medicare Part B therapy coverage as of January 1, 2018.  The industry estimates that these changes may potentially (i) result in the restoration of Medicare Part B SNF revenues that would have declined had the therapy caps remained in place and (ii) permit continued medically necessary services to maintain beneficiary quality of care levels. However, these changes reduced the reimbursement rate for Medicare Part B therapy services performed by therapy assistants to 85% of the physician fee schedule beginning January 1, 2022 which may offset some of the additional expenses.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also restored the limited post-pay claims review process and eliminated a threat to future SNF Medicare payment rates by ending the “Independent Payment Advisory Board” established under the Healthcare Reform Law.
 Relatedly, CMS released a final rule on December 1, 2017 to significantly scale back mandatory participation in the bundled payment program for Lower Extremity Joint Replacement (“CJR”) procedures that went into effect on April 1, 2016, and was mandatory for all hospitals paid under the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System that are located in the 67 selected metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”). Effective January 1, 2018, CJR program participation under the final rule became voluntary for the eligible hospitals in 33 of the MSAs covered by the program as of February 2018.  The CJR program will remain mandatory in the 34 MSAs for the duration of the program, with an exception for certain low volume and rural hospitals.  CMS anticipates the number of mandatory participating hospitals to decrease from approximately 700 under this rule. SNFs receiving Medicare revenues related to hospital discharges subject to CJR bundled payment programs in the identified geographic areas could be either positively or negatively affected by the CJR bundled payment program.  
 Quality of Care Initiatives. In addition to quality or value based reimbursement reforms, CMS has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the quality of care provided by long term care facilities that could affect our operators. In December 2008, CMS released quality ratings for all of the nursing homes that participate in Medicare or Medicaid under its “Five Star Quality Rating System.” Facility rankings, ranging from five stars (“much above average”) to one star (“much below average”) are updated on a monthly basis. SNFs are required to provide information for the CMS Nursing Home Compare website regarding staffing and quality measures. Based on this data and the results of state health inspections, SNFs are then rated based on the five-star rating system.
 In August 2016, CMS announced a modification to the Five Star Quality Rating System through the introduction of new quality measures based primarily on Medicare claims data submitted by hospitals, including: (1) percentage of short-stay residents who were successfully discharged to the community; (2) percentage of short-stay residents who have had an outpatient emergency department visit; (3) percentage of short-stay residents who were re-hospitalized after a nursing home admission; (4) percentage of short-stay residents who made improvements in function; and (5) percentage of long-stay residents whose ability to move independently worsened. These ratings were incorporated into the nursing home rating system in July 2016 and were phased in through January 2017. It is possible that this or any other ranking system could lead to future reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters.
 Office of the Inspector General Activities.  Beginning June 15, 2017, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) began updating its Work Plan website monthly in order to enhance transparency around the OIG’s continuous work planning efforts.  The OIG reported in its January 2018 update that it would review the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, including elders and disabled persons, who are being treated at inpatient and outpatient medical facilities for conditions that may be the result of abuse or neglect. The OIG referenced prior reviews which indicated problems with the quality of care and the reporting and investigation of potential abuse or neglect at group homes, nursing homes, and skilled nursing facilities.   The OIG additionally included a review of the staffing levels reported by SNFs as part of its August 2018 updates, as well as a review involuntary transfers and discharges from nursing homes in its November 2018 updates  The OIG is continuing to review whether ambulance services paid by Medicare Part B were appropriately subject to Part A SNF consolidated billing requirements.

 These monthly Work Plan updates supplement the OIG’s Work Plan for government fiscal year 2017 that included seven projects related specifically to nursing homes: (1) determining to what extent State agencies investigate serious nursing home complaints within the required timeframes; (2) unreported incidents of potential abuse and neglect in SNFs; (3) review of SNF Medicare reimbursement documentation (determine if it meets requirements for each particular resource utilization group); (4) the SNF Adverse Event Screening Tool, which will disseminate practical information about the SNF Adverse Event Trigger Tool; (5) review of the National Background Check Program for long-term care employees; (6) compliance with the SNF prospective payment system requirement related to a three-day qualifying inpatient hospital stay; and (7) review of potentially avoidable hospitalizations of Medicare and Medicaid-Eligible nursing facility residents and prevention and detection services provided by nursing homes.  Additionally, regional Recovery Audit Contractor program auditors along with the OIG and Department of Justice are expected to continue their efforts to evaluate SNF Medicare claims for any excessive therapy charges.  
 Department of Justice. SNFs are under intense scrutiny for the quality of care being rendered to residents and appropriate billing practices. The Department of Justice launched ten regional Elder Justice Task Forces in 2016 which are coordinating and enhancing efforts to pursue SNFs that provide grossly substandard care to their residents. They are also focusing on therapy billing issues. These Task Forces are composed of representatives from the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, state and local prosecutors’ offices, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), State Adult Protective Services agencies, Long Term Care Ombudsmen programs, and law enforcement.
 Medicare and Medicaid Program Audits.  Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the HHS-OIG and HHS-OCR, CMS and state Medicaid programs, may conduct audits of our operators’ billing practices.  Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program, to managed Medicare plans and in the Medicaid program.  CMS also employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities. Should any of our operators be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
 Fraud and Abuse. There are various federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing a wide array of healthcare provider referrals, relationships and arrangements, including laws and regulations prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers. Many of these complex laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted by the relevant governmental authorities and courts.
 These laws include: (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, such as services provided in a SNF; (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the Stark Law), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities for designated health services (some of which are provided in SNFs) with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship; (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal. 
 Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. Additionally, there are criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under Medicare and Medicaid, as well as failing to refund overpayments or improper payments. Violation of the Anti-kickback statute or Stark Law may form the basis for a federal False Claims Act violation. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions, which have become more frequent in recent years.  
 Several of our operators have responded to subpoenas and other requests for information regarding their operations in connection with inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice or other regulatory agencies.

 Privacy. Our operators are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and the corresponding regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively referred to herein as “HIPAA”). The HITECH Act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information, providing enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations, and granting enforcement authority to states’ Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights.  Additionally, in a final rule issued in January, 2013, HHS modified the standard for determining whether a breach has occurred by creating a presumption that any non-permitted acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information is a breach unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised, based on a risk assessment.  HHS continued its auditing program in 2016 to assess compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. Through a second phase of audits, which commenced for covered entities in July 2016, HHS focused on a review of policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.  Covered entities and business associates selected for a desk audit have the potential to be selected for an on-site audit.  The HHS Office for Civil Rights reported that as of February 2018, the Phase 2 desk audits of covered entities and business associates were completed, and additional comprehensive on-site audits would be conducted as part of a permanent audit program going forward.  
 Various states have similar laws and regulations that govern the maintenance and safeguarding of patient records, charts and other information generated in connection with the provision of professional medical services. These laws and regulations require our operators to expend the requisite resources to secure protected health information, including the funding of costs associated with technology upgrades. Operators found in violation of HIPAA or any other privacy law or regulation may face significant monetary penalties. In addition, compliance with an operator’s notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information could cause reputational harm to an operator’s business.
 Licensing and Certification. Our operators and facilities are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations, including laws and regulations under Medicare and Medicaid requiring operators of SNFs and ALFs to comply with extensive standards governing operations. Governmental agencies administering these laws and regulations regularly inspect our operators’ facilities and investigate complaints. Our operators and their managers receive notices of observed violations and deficiencies from time to time, and sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them. In addition, many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities, which has the potential to impact some of our operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
 Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”).  Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Our commitment to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is ongoing, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.
 Other Laws and Regulations.  Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affect how our operators conduct their operations, including laws and regulations protecting consumers against deceptive practices and otherwise generally affecting our operators’ management of their property and equipment and the conduct of their operations (including laws and regulations involving fire, health and safety; quality of services, including care and food service; residents’ rights, including abuse and neglect laws; and the health standards set by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration).
 General and Professional Liability.  Although arbitration agreements have been effective in limiting general and professional liabilities for SNF and long term care providers, there have been numerous lawsuits challenging the validity of arbitration agreements in long term care settings. As set forth in the recent conditions of participation final rule issued on October 4, 2016, CMS prohibited pre-dispute arbitration agreements between SNFs and residents effective November 28, 2016, thereby increasing potential liabilities for SNFs and long-term care providers.   Subsequently, the authority of CMS to restrict the rights of these parties to arbitrate was challenged by litigation in various jurisdictions, and enforcement by CMS was suspended on November 7, 2016 following the issuance of a preliminary injunction by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi.  In a reversal from its previous

position, CMS issued a proposed rule on June 5, 2017, that lifts CMS’ ban on pre-dispute arbitration agreements in the long-term care setting. The proposed rule continues to face challenges by certain industry groups.
