ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 Sunesis Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“Sunesis” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new targeted inhibitors for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers. Our primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development internally and through corporate collaborators, in-licensing and out-licensing pharmaceutical compounds and technology, conducting clinical trials, and raising capital.
 Our lead program is vecabrutinib, a non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase, or BTK. In clinical trials, vecabrutinib has shown activity against both wild type and C481S-mutated BTK, the most common mutation associated with resistance to ibrutinib. Vecabrutinib is being studied in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to assess safety and activity in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies after two or more prior therapies, including ibrutinib or another covalent BTK inhibitor where approved for the disease. The Phase 1b portion of the study is a dose escalation component that will proceed to define a maximum tolerated dose and/or a recommended Phase 2 dose. Upon identifying the Phase 2 dose, the Phase 2 portion will further explore clinical activity and safety in disease- and mutation-specific cohorts, including patients with and without BTK C481 mutations.
 We are also developing SNS-510, a PDK1 inhibitor licensed from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. We acquired from Takeda global commercial rights to several potential first-in class, preclinical inhibitors of the novel target PDK1, including SNS-510. We are currently characterizing SNS-510 through preclinical pharmacology studies, manufacturing and formulation activities. 
 We are in a collaboration with Takeda for the development of TAK-580 (formerly MLN2480), an oral pan-RAF inhibitor, which is under investigation for pediatric low-grade glioma. 
 We are also evaluating strategic alternatives for vosaroxin, a topoisomerase 2 inhibitor for which we conducted a Phase 3 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

Our Strategy 
 We plan to continue to build Sunesis into a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new targeted oncology therapeutics by: 
  
• | exploring the safety and efficacy of vecabrutinib as a potential treatment for B-cell malignancies, including for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (“CLL”) patients who have relapsed following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | characterizing SNS-510 through preclinical pharmacology studies, manufacturing and formulation activities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing to expand and develop our oncology-focused pipeline through further licensing or collaboration arrangements and research and development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development Pipeline 
 The following chart summarizes our development pipeline: 
 
Vecabrutinib (SNS-062) 
 Vecabrutinib is a selective, reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor. BTK mediates signaling through the B-cell receptor, and is critical for adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival of normal and malignant B-lineage lymphoid cells. BTK has been well validated as a target for treatment of B-cell malignancies, with the covalent BTK inhibitors Imbruvica® (ibrutinib) and Calquence® (acalabrutinib) approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, and Imbruvica also approved for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory CLL, CLL with 17p deletion, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), and marginal zone lymphoma.  Covalent BTK inhibitors, including Imbruvica and Calquence, form an irreversible bond with cysteine residue 481 (C481) in the BTK kinase domain.  This cysteine may mutate to a serine (“C481S”) or another amino acid and this is associated with disease progression and resistance to further treatment with covalent BTK inhibitors. Resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors is a growing problem, with a seminal 2017 paper in the Journal of Clinical Oncology by Woyach et al finding 19% of Imbruvica-treated patients had developed resistance by year 4. Studies, including this one, as well as by the European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC) and the French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) Group identified the BTK C481S mutation in more than half of Imbruvica-relapsed patients. Collectively these studies provide further evidence of resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors as a significant and growing problem. Vecabrutinib has shown potent inhibitory activity in vitro against both wild type and C481S-mutated BTK and may provide a potential solution to resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors.
 In addition to vecabrutinib’s non-covalent inhibition of BTK, vecabrutinib inhibits interleukin-2 inducible kinase (ITK). Inhibition of ITK may improve anti-tumor T-cell activity, and inhibition of both BTK and ITK contributes to Imbruvica’s activity in cGVHD and also the potential improvement in response when combined with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies. Notably, vecabrutinib does not inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a kinase target associated with skin and gastrointestinal toxicities. Vecabrutinib’s distinct kinase selectivity profile and favorable pharmacokinetics indicate the potential for vecabrutinib to become a differentiated treatment for B-cell malignancies. In 2018, we continued to invest in building vecabrutinib’s nonclinical profile resulting in presentations at the 2018 annual meetings of the European Hematology Association (EHA) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH).

In July 2017, we announced the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 1b/2 study, and in connection to this event, we also made a milestone payment of $2.5 million to Biogen Idec MA, Inc., or Biogen, under the licensing agreement.
 We are studying vecabrutinib in a Phase 1b/2 trial in adults with B-cell malignancies, including relapsed/refractory CLL. The study is now open at 8 leading clinical sites: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, UC Irvine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Swedish Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Moffitt Cancer Center, and University California San Diego. Preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics from vecabrutinib’s Phase 1b/2 study, as well as some early evidence of clinical activity, were presented at ASH 2018. Specifically, vecabrutinib exposure is sustained throughout the dosing interval, with evidence of pharmacodynamic activity in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Decreases in pBTK and tumor microenvironment-relevant cytokines were observed in patients with and without BTK C481 mutations. The most common treatment emergent adverse events included anemia, neutropenia, and night sweats. The preliminary safety profile of vecabrutinib is acceptable and dose escalation in the study is continuing. The 100 mg BID cohort opened at the end of 2018.
 SNS-510
 Our first-in-class PDK1 inhibitor SNS-510 is in preclinical studies. 
 In January 2014, we in-licensed a series of selective PDK1 inhibitors from Takeda that were discovered under a research collaboration agreement between Biogen and Sunesis, as described below. PDK1 is a key kinase and mediator of PI3K/AKT signaling and also regulates other pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-KB, by PI3K-independent mechanisms. These pathways are involved in cell growth, differentiation, survival and migration and are frequently dysregulated in cancers. PDK1 inhibitors are expected to be broadly active in both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. We have taken a series of PDK1 inhibitors with confirmed antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo into preclinical development, and in 2017, we selected SNS-510 as a development candidate. 
 There are multiple PI3K pathway inhibitors in late stage development or approval for use in CLL, follicular lymphoma and other malignancies, but no other PDK1 inhibitor approved or in late stage development. We believe SNS-510 is a potential first-in-class compound with demonstrated inhibition of PI3K-dependent and independent pathways and a compelling in vitro and in vivo profile. SNS-510 has the potential for broad-spectrum single agent and combination activity in both solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. 
 TAK-580 (formerly MLN2480) 
 This pan-Raf inhibitor program had its origins in a collaboration agreement between Sunesis and Biogen. In March 2011, Biogen’s rights to this program were exclusively assigned to Takeda. The Raf kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf) are key regulators of cell proliferation and survival within the MAPK pathway. Pan-RAF inhibitors such as TAK-580 are able to regulate MAPK pathway activation that are driven by RAF-monomer signaling, such as BRAF V600 mutations, and are uniquely positioned to also inhibit RAF dimer signaling, which can drive cancers with RAS mutations, non-V600 BRAF mutations, and RAF fusions. 
 In February 2018, an investigator-sponsored trial was initiated evaluating TAK-580 in Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma (PLGG), for which we believe the scientific rationale is compelling.  PLGG accounts for nearly 30% of pediatric brain cancer, and Fusion-RAF proteins are present in a large proportion of these pediatric tumors. There is a significant unmet need for these children. The trial is ongoing.
 Under the license agreement, we may in the future receive up to $57.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Takeda of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the Raf target, and royalty payments depending on related product sales, as further described below. 
 Vosaroxin
 Vosaroxin is an anti-cancer quinolone derivative that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme critical for cell replication, resulting in replication-dependent, site-selective DNA damage, G2 arrest and apoptosis. We licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin from Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo”) in 2003. The Phase 3 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival.
 We filed a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) at the end of 2015 and had several interactions with the EMA in early 2017. As a result of these interactions, feedback from our CHMP rapporteurs and our retained regulatory consultants, and an internal assessment, we announced on May 1, 2017 the withdrawal of our MAA. In 2018 we conducted a thorough process with potential business partners to evaluate various development paths for vosaroxin and we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives.

License, Collaboration and Royalty Agreements 
 Licensing and Collaboration Agreements with Biogen and Takeda 
 Overview 
 In August 2004, we entered into the original collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Biogen OCA”) to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule inhibitors of the human protein Raf kinase, including family members Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf, (collectively “Raf”), and up to five additional targets that play a role in oncology and immunology indications such as BTK and PDK1. 
 In June 2008, the parties agreed to terminate the research term and related funding. In March 2011, as part of a series of agreements among Sunesis, Biogen and Takeda, we entered into: (a) an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen (“the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA”); (b) a license agreement with Millennium (“the Takeda Agreement”); and (c) a termination and transition agreement among Sunesis, Biogen and Takeda (“the Termination and Transition Agreement”). 
 The Termination and Transition Agreement provided for the termination of Biogen’s exclusive rights under the Biogen OCA to all discovery programs under such agreement other than for small molecule inhibitors of the human protein BTK and the permitted assignment to Takeda of all related Biogen collaboration assets and rights to Raf kinase and the human protein PDK1. 
 Biogen  
 In December 2013, we entered into a second amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Biogen 2nd ARCA”), which amended and restated the Biogen 1st ARCA, to provide us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize vecabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor synthesized under the Biogen 1st ARCA, solely for oncology indications. During the third quarter of 2017, we made a milestone payment of $2.5 million to Biogen upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety and activity of vecabrutinib in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies after two or more prior therapies, including ibrutinib or other covalent BTK inhibitors, and including patients with BTK C481 mutations. We may also be required to make royalty payments on product sales of vecabrutinib. 
Takeda 
 Under the Takeda Agreement, we granted exclusive licenses to products against two oncology, Raf and PDK1, under substantially the same terms as under the Biogen OCA. 
 In January 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Takeda (“the Amended Takeda Agreement”), to provide us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize preclinical inhibitors of PDK1. In connection with execution of the Amended Takeda Agreement, we paid an upfront fee and may in the future be required to make up to $9.2 million in pre-commercialization milestone payments depending on our development of PDK1 inhibitors and royalty payments depending on related product sales. 
 With respect to the Raf target, Takeda is developing the oral investigative drug TAK-580, and we may in the future receive up to $57.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Takeda of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the Raf target and royalty payments depending on related product sales. The agreement also provides us with future co-development and co-promotion rights. TAK-580 is currently being studied in a Phase 1b/2 clinical study for children with Low-Grade Gliomas and other RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK Pathway Activated Tumors. 
 In-license Agreement with Sumitomo 
 In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Sumitomo to acquire exclusive worldwide development and marketing rights for vosaroxin. In the future we may be required to make additional milestone payments of up to $6.5 million in aggregate to Sumitomo for (a) filing New Drug Applications (“NDA”), in the U.S. and Japan, and (b) for receiving regulatory approvals in these regions and the EU, for cancer-related indications. If vosaroxin is approved for a non-cancer indication, an additional milestone payment will become payable to Sumitomo. The agreement also provides for royalty payments to Sumitomo at rates based on total annual net sales. 
 If we discontinue seeking regulatory approval and/or the sale of the product in a region, we are required to return our rights to the product in that region to Sumitomo. The agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party’s uncured breach or bankruptcy.

Manufacturing 
 We rely on, and we expect to continue to rely on, a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of all of our active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), including vecabrutinib, SNS-510 and vosaroxin and the finished drug product (“FDP”) incorporating the APIs. Vecabrutinib API and FDP are manufactured under master services agreements. SNS-510 API and FDP are manufactured under research and development agreements. We have supply agreements for vosaroxin API and FDP. 
 We currently rely on two contract manufacturers for vecabrutinib API and two for FDP. Three lots of API have been manufactured at a clinical scale. Scale-up to commercial scale has not been done. The cost to manufacture vecabrutinib at large scale is unknown.
 Competition 
 The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching, developing and marketing products designed to address the treatment of cancer, including B-cell malignancies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in the clinical testing of, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and marketing drugs. 
 With respect to vecabrutinib, we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing different product candidates that could inhibit C481S-mutated BTK, including Aptose Biosciences Inc., ArQule, Inc., and Loxo Oncology, Inc. Moreover, numerous companies are also pursuing inhibitors of wild-type BTK, including AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”), with its drug IMBRUVICA®. Other companies with BTK inhibitors currently in development include AstraZeneca PLC, BeiGene, Ltd., EMD Merck, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”), Principia Biopharm Inc., and others in oncology and non-oncology indications. Other drugs that may compete to treat ibrutinib-refractory patients, including patients with C481S-mutated BTK in monotherapy or in combination, include; AbbVie’s Bcl-2 inhibitor VENCLEXTA™, Gilead’s Zydelig PI3K kinase inhibitor, TG Therapeutics, Inc.’s umbralisib PI3K inhibitor, Verastem’s duvelisib PI3K inhibitor, and CAR-T cell therapies such as Novartis Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) and Gilead’s Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel).
 Intellectual Property 
 We believe that patent protection is very important to our business and that our future success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents protecting vecabrutinib, SNS-510, TAK-580, vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any. Historically, we have patented a wide range of technology, inventions and improvements related to our business.  When appropriate, we seek orphan drug status and/or data exclusivity in the United States and their equivalents in other relevant jurisdictions, to the maximum extent that the respective laws will permit at such time. For example, we secured orphan drug designation for vosaroxin for the treatment of AML from the European Commission and from the FDA. For an approved medicine, such designation may, in the European Union, provide ten years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries, or seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S.

General
 While it is possible that patent term restoration and/or supplemental patent certificates could be available for some of these or other patents we own or control through licenses after possible approval of commercial product, we cannot guarantee that such additional protection will be obtained, and the expiration dates described here do not include such term restoration.
 Our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to conduct our business. The existence of third-party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. If patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be enjoined from pursuing research, development or commercialization of vecabrutinib, SNS-510, TAK-580, vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any, or be required to obtain licenses to such patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. 
 
We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially in situations or jurisdictions in which we believe patent protection may not be appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and do not protect technology against independent developments made by third parties. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. We seek to protect our company name and the names of our products and technologies by obtaining trademark registrations, as well as common law rights in trademarks and service marks, in the United States and in other countries. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our product candidates and any future drug candidates we may develop, if any. The application of these regulatory frameworks to the development, approval and commercialization of our drug candidates will take a number of years to accomplish, if at all, and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. 
 8


In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and implements regulations. The process required by the FDA before any of our drug candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an NDA to the FDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including proposed labeling (package insert information) and promotional materials, prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Preclinical Testing and INDs 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. Laboratories that comply with the FDA Good Laboratory Practice regulations must conduct preclinical safety tests. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Protection of Human Subjects regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. 
 In addition, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each institution where the study will be conducted. Each IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements and regulations for informed consent. 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap, sometimes followed by a fourth phase: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety (adverse effects), dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. In some cases, particularly in cancer trials, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a “Phase 1b” evaluation, which is a safety-focused, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a “Phase 2b” evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory Phase 2 clinical trial that could, if positive and accepted by the FDA, serve as a pivotal clinical trial in the approval of a drug candidate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials. When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a drug candidate has potential activity in a disease or condition and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 (post-marketing) clinical trials may be required by the FDA in some cases. The FDA may conditionally approve an NDA for a drug candidate on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and/or efficacy after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Drug Applications 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months of filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. 
 After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Orphan Drug Designation 
 The United States Orphan Drug Act promotes the development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Upon receipt of orphan drug designation from the FDA, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, waiver of PDUFA application fee, and upon approval, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the Orphan Drug tax credit was reduced from 50% to 25%. In October 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for treatment of AML. 
 In the European Union, orphan status is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 people, and provides for the potential for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. The marketing exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In April 2012, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML.
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us, Biogen, Takeda, or our potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, including cancer therapy. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. 
 Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. 
 11


Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens.
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to a wide range of sanctions and penalties, potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending any such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance and disrupt our business operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products, when and if approved for marketing, depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA.  Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our business are that it: created an annual fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.  Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts 
 12


by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two Executive Orders and other directives to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as well as other legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.  Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 
Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of or our drug candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, permission to conduct clinical research is granted by the Competent Authority of each European Member State (“MS”), and the applicable Ethics Committees (“EC”), through the submission of a Clinical Trial Application. An EC in the European Union serves the same function as an IRB in the United States. The review times vary by MS but may not exceed 60 days. The EC has a maximum of 60 days to give its opinion on the acceptability of the Clinical Trial Application to both the governing MS and the sponsor applicant. If the application is deemed acceptable, the MS informs the applicant (or does not within the 60-day window inform the applicant of non-acceptance) and we may proceed with the clinical trial. 
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we must submit an MAA under the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization from the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the CHMP of the EMA that is valid in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), which includes all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.

In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. A European Union orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once a marketing authorization is obtained for a pediatric indication in all Member States of the European Union and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan-designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the European Union, we will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our product candidates. Our ability to sell drugs will also depend on the availability of reimbursement from government and private insurance companies. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We expect to continue to incur significant development expenses related to the development of vecabrutinib and our other drug candidates. 
 Environment
