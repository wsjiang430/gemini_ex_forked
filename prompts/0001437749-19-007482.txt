ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1997 and is primarily a specialty retailer offering a “make your own stuffed animal” interactive retail-entertainment experience. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 373 corporately-managed locations, including 313 stores in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, 60 stores in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Ireland, Denmark, and China and had 97 franchised stores operating internationally under the Build-A-Bear Workshop brand. In addition to our stores, we sold product on our company-owned e-commerce sites, third-party marketplaces and franchisee sites and through retailer’s wholesale agreements. 
Segments and Geographic Areas
 
Business is conducted through three reportable segments consisting of direct-to-consumer (“DTC”), commercial, and international franchising. Our reportable segments are primarily determined by the types of customers they serve and the types of products and services that they offer. Each reportable segment may operate in many geographic areas. Financial information related to our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See Note 15 — Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales, results of operations and identifiable assets of the Company by business segment and geographic area.
Description of Operations
 
Currently, we primarily operate specialty stores that provide a “make your own stuffed animal” interactive entertainment experience in which guests, with the help of our associates, visit a variety of stations to “assemble” and customize a stuffed animal. Our concept is a unique combination of experience and product and we are focused on enhancing our brand equity while meeting the needs of consumers by offering a relevant selection of premium products that meet high quality standards and are on trend. In addition, products are sold through e-commerce sites and franchise sites as well. Our store experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics, including children, as well as their parents and grandparents, teens, adult collector and affinity consumers. We seek to provide outstanding guest service and experiences across all channels and touch points including our stores, our e-commerce site, our mobile sites and apps as well as traditional and social media. Guests visit our stores for multiple reasons including interactive family experiences, birthdays, parties and other milestone occasions as well as to purchase gifts including the “gift of experience” that comes with a gift card. We believe the hands-on and interactive nature of our store and high touch service model result in guests forming an emotional connection with our brand. 
 
Our net sales are moderately seasonal. However, due to the change in our fiscal year-end from the Saturday closest to December 31, to the Saturday closest to January 31, we expect to realize more sales in our fiscal fourth quarter than in prior years.
 
We believe there are opportunities to leverage the strength of the Build-A-Bear brand and generate incremental revenue and profits given the high consumer recognition and strong positioning as a trusted, high quality brand that is emotionally connected with both kids and their parents.
 
Operating Strategies
 
In fiscal 2018, we continued to evolve and execute our strategic plan with key initiatives in the areas outlined below, which are intended to drive long-term shareholder value:
Channel Evolution through Diversifying Real Estate and Upgrading E-Commerce Capabilities
 We continued to diversify our real estate portfolio to locations that families are increasingly going to shop and for entertainment, such as tourist destinations, cruise ships, holiday pop-up shops and mass merchandising locations in order to reach a broader consumer base. In addition, we are strategically managing the traditional mall portfolio and renegotiating leases to optimize the cash flow to fund investments needed to achieve our desired future state. Therefore, we have used favorable short-term extensions to maintain flexibility and optionality within our corporately-managed portfolio with over 60% of our leases across geographies expiring in the next three years.
 
In fiscal 2018, we added a new franchise agreement covering India and Sri Lanka. We intend to add new franchise agreements covering other markets in the future. Separately, we have seen positive results from investments in our upgraded e-commerce platform along with improved processes and an evolved digital strategy.
 
Product Expansion through Owned Intellectual Property Development, Relevant Licensing and Outbound Brand Licensing into New Categories
 To meet the needs of our core consumer base (boys and girls ages 3 to 12) while systematically building secondary consumer segments (including collectors, gift-givers and teen-plus consumers), we continued to develop and expand offerings of successful intellectual properties balanced with core products and a comprehensive program of key licensed products. We also continued to expand our initiatives to sell pre-stuffed plush products for corporate promotions or to other companies for resell and to further develop outbound licensed programs leveraging the power of the Build-A-Bear brand and other owned intellectual properties.

Brand and Experience Amplification through Marketing and Entertainment Integration 
 We adjusted marketing programs to be more reflective of our guests’ changing media habits across channels while leveraging our content development strategy, which includes mobile apps, music videos and other entertainment opportunities to increase engagement.
Continued Focus on Delivering Long-Term Profitability Improvement
 We remained focused on the execution of our stated strategies summarized above as well as disciplined expense management and on-going investments to upgrade our processes, systems and infrastructure with the goal to achieve longer-term profitability improvement.
Merchandise Sourcing and Inventory Management
 
Our stores offer an extensive and coordinated selection of merchandise, including a wide range of different styles of plush products to be stuffed, sounds and scents that can be added to the stuffed animals and a broad variety of clothing, shoes and accessories, as well as other brand appropriate toy and novelty items. Our stuffed animal products and clothing are produced from high quality, man-made materials or natural fibers, and the stuffing is made of a high-grade polyester fiber.
 
We believe we comply with governmental toy safety requirements specific to each country where we have stores. Specifically, we believe all of the products in our stores and e-commerce sites meet Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) for children’s products. We also believe we comply with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-F963), European Toy Safety Standards (EN71), China National Toy Standards (GB6675/GB5296.5), China Compulsory Certification (CCC), Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 8124), Canadian Consumer Product Safety Act Toys Regulation (CCPSA) and India Safety of Toys (IS:9873). Our products are tested through independent third-party testing labs for compliance with toy safety standards. Packaging and labels for each product indicate the age grading for the product and any special warnings in accordance with guidelines established by the CPSC. We require our supplier factories to be compliant with the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) Ethical Toy Program certification or with other third party social compliance programs. The ICTI Ethical Toy Program process is the social compliance program to promote ethical manufacturing in the form of fair labor treatment, as well as employee health and safety in the toy industry supply chain worldwide. In order to obtain this certification, each factory completes a rigorous evaluation performed by an accredited ICTI agent on an annual basis.
 
The average time from product conception to the arrival in stores is approximately 12 months, including approximately 90 to 120 days from the beginning of production to in-store delivery. Through an ongoing analysis of selling trends, we regularly update our product assortment by increasing quantities of productive styles and eliminating less productive items. Our relationships with our vendors generally are on a purchase order basis and do not provide a contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing on a long-term basis.
 
Distribution and Logistics
 
We own a 350,000 square-foot distribution center near Columbus, Ohio which serves the majority of our stores in the United States and Canada. We also contract with a third-party warehouse in southern California to service our West Coast stores. The contract has a one-year term and is renewable. In Europe, we contract with a third-party distribution center in Selby, England under an agreement that ends in December 2019. This agreement contains clauses that allow for termination if certain performance criteria are not met. In Asia, we contract with a third-party distribution center in Shanghai, China under an agreement that ends in March 2020.
 
Transportation from the warehouses to stores is managed by several third-party logistics providers. In the United States, Canada and Europe, merchandise is shipped by a variety of distribution methods, depending on the store and seasonal inventory demand. Shipments from our distribution centers are scheduled throughout the week in order to smooth workflow and stores are grouped together by shipping route to reduce freight costs. All items in our assortment are eligible for distribution, depending on allocation and fulfillment requirements, and we typically distribute merchandise and supplies to each store once or twice a week on a regular schedule, which allows us to consolidate shipments in order to reduce distribution and shipping costs. Back-up supplies, such as stuffing for the plush animals, are often stored in limited amounts at regional pool points.
 
Employees 
 
As of February 2, 2019, we had approximately 1,000 full-time and 3,300 regular part-time employees in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Denmark and China. The number of part-time employees at all locations fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Competition
 
We view the Build-A-Bear Workshop store experience as a distinctive combination of entertainment and retail with limited direct competition. Since we develop proprietary products, we compete indirectly with a number of brands that sell stuffed animals or premium children’s toys in the United States, including, but not limited to, Ty, Fisher Price, Mattel, Ganz, Hasbro, Commonwealth and Vermont Teddy Bear. In the U.K., we compete with a number of retailers including The Entertainer Toy Shop, Smyths Toys Superstores and Hamleys Toy Store. Since we sell a product that integrates merchandise and experience, we also view our competition as any company that competes for family time and entertainment dollars, such as movie theaters, amusement parks and arcades, other mall-based entertainment venues and online entertainment. With the majority of our stores currently operating in traditional shopping malls, we also compete with other mall-based retailers, including various apparel, footwear and specialty retailers, for prime mall locations.

We are aware of several small companies that operate “make your own” teddy bear and stuffed animal stores or kiosks in retail locations, but we believe none of those companies offer the breadth of assortment nor depth of experience or operate as a national or international retail company.
 
Intellectual Property and Trademarks 
 
We believe our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and similar intellectual property are critical to our success, and we intend, directly or indirectly, to maintain and protect these marks and, where applicable, license the intellectual property. Our patents do not expire until the years 2032 and 2033.
 
We have developed licensing and strategic relationships with leading retail and cultural organizations. We plan to continue to collaborate with companies that have strong, family-oriented brands and provide us with attractive marketing and merchandising opportunities. These relationships for specific products are generally reflected in contractual arrangements for limited terms that are terminable by either party upon specified notice. Specifically, we have key strategic relationships with select companies in which we feature their brands on products sold in our stores, including Disney®, DreamWorks Animation, Hasbro, and major professional and collegiate sports along with other culturally relevant brands.
