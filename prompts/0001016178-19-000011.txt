ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
Carver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is the holding company for Carver Federal Savings Bank (“Carver Federal” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered savings bank. The Company is headquartered in New York, New York. The Company conducts business as a unitary savings and loan holding company, and the principal business of the Company consists of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Carver Federal. Carver Federal was founded in 1948 to serve African-American communities whose residents, businesses and institutions had limited access to mainstream financial services. The Bank remains headquartered in Harlem, and predominantly all of its eight branches and three stand-alone 24/7 ATM centers are located in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. Many of these historically underserved communities have experienced unprecedented growth and diversification of incomes, ethnicity and economic opportunity, after decades of public and private investment.
Carver Federal is among the largest African-American operated banks in the United States. The Bank remains dedicated to expanding wealth enhancing opportunities in the communities it serves by increasing access to capital and other financial services for consumers, businesses and non-profit organizations, including faith-based institutions. A measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's fifth consecutive "Outstanding" rating, issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") following its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination in January 2019. The OCC found that approximately 75% of originated and purchased loans were within Carver Federal assessment area, and the Bank has demonstrated excellent responsiveness to its assessment area's needs through its community development lending, investing and service activities. The Bank had approximately $563.7 million in assets and 114 employees as of March 31, 2019.
Carver Federal engages in a wide range of consumer and commercial banking services.  The Bank provides deposit products, including demand, savings and time deposits for consumers, businesses, and governmental and quasi-governmental agencies in its local market area within New York City.  In addition to deposit products, Carver Federal offers a number of other consumer and commercial banking products and services, including debit cards, online banking, online bill pay and telephone banking. Carver Federal also offers a suite of products and services for unbanked and underbanked consumers, branded as Carver Community Cash. This includes check cashing, wire transfers, bill payment, reloadable prepaid cards and money orders.
Carver Federal offers loan products covering a variety of asset classes, including commercial and multifamily mortgages, and business loans.  The Bank finances mortgage and loan products through deposits or borrowings.  Funds not used to originate commercial mortgages and loans are invested primarily in U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities.
The Bank's primary market area for deposits consists of the areas served by its eight branches in the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens boroughs of New York City.  The neighborhoods in which the Bank's branches are located have historically been low- to moderate-income areas. The Bank's primary lending market includes Kings, New York, Bronx and Queens Counties in New York City, and lower Westchester County, New York. Although the Bank's branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas. Management believes that this competition has become more intense as a result of increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions' fulfillment of their responsibilities under the CRA and more recently due to the decline in demand for loans. Carver Federal's market area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence, and all of which are competitors to varying degrees. The Bank's competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions and mortgage banking companies. The Bank's most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions. Competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds, corporate and government securities funds, and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Many of the Bank's competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products.  This, combined with competitors' larger presence in the New York market, add to the challenges the Bank faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near-term profitability.
Carver Federal's 70-year history in its market area, its community involvement and relationships, targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking, help the Bank compete with competitors that have entered its market.
The Bank formalized its many community focused investments on August 18, 2005, by forming Carver Community Development Corporation ("CCDC"). CCDC oversees the Bank's participation in local economic development and other 
 2

community-based initiatives, including financial literacy activities. CCDC coordinates the Bank's development of an innovative approach to reach the unbanked customer market in Carver Federal's communities. Importantly, CCDC spearheads the Bank's applications for grants and other resources to help fund these important community activities. In this connection, Carver Federal has successfully competed with large regional and global financial institutions in a number of competitions for government grants and other awards.  In June 2006, CCDC was selected by the U.S. Department of Treasury, in a highly competitive process, to receive an award of $59 million in New Markets Tax Credits ("NMTC"). CCDC won a second NMTC award of $65 million in May 2009, and a third award of $25 million in August 2011. The NMTC award is used to stimulate economic development in low- to moderate-income communities.  The NMTC awards enable the Bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including, in some cases, below market interest rates, which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating revitalization of the community, pursuant to the goals of the NMTC program. NMTC awards provide a credit to Carver Federal against Federal income taxes when the Bank makes qualified investments. The credits are allocated over seven years from the time of the qualified investment. Alternatively, the Bank can utilize the award in projects where another investor entity provides funding and receives the tax benefits of the award in exchange for the Bank receiving fee income. As of March 31, 2019, all three award allocations have been fully utilized in qualifying projects. See "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and footnotes to the financial statements for additional details on the NMTC activities.

Carver Bancorp, Inc.
The Company is the holding company for Carver Federal and its other active direct subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), a Delaware trust.
The principal business of the Company consists of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Company's administrative offices are located at 1825 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10034. The home office of the Bank is located at 75 West 125th Street, New York, New York 10027.

Carver Federal Savings Bank
Carver Federal was chartered in 1948 and began operations in 1949 as Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association, at which time it obtained federal deposit insurance and became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLB-NY”). Carver Federal was founded as an African- and Caribbean-American operated institution to provide residents of underserved communities the ability to invest their savings and obtain credit. Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association converted to a federal savings bank in 1986 and changed its name at that time to Carver Federal Savings Bank. 
On March 8, 1995, Carver Federal formed CFSB Realty Corp. as a wholly-owned subsidiary to hold real estate acquired through foreclosure pending eventual disposition.  At March 31, 2019, this subsidiary had $2.3 million in total assets. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, Carver Federal formed Carver Asset Corporation (“CAC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary which qualifies as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  This subsidiary may, among other things, be utilized by Carver Federal to raise capital in the future.  As of March 31, 2019, CAC owned mortgage loans carried at approximately $12.5 million and total assets of $129.3 million.  On August 18, 2005, Carver Federal formed CCDC, a wholly-owned community development entity, to facilitate and develop innovative approaches to financial literacy, address the needs of the unbanked and participate in local economic development and other community-based activities.  As part of its operations, CCDC monitors the portfolio of investments related to NMTC awards and makes application for additional awards.
Carver Statutory Trust I
Carver Statutory Trust (the "Trust") was formed in 2003 for the purpose of issuing $13.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate Capital Securities due September 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities, which are wholly owned by Carver Bancorp, Inc. and the sole voting securities of the Trust. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Capital Securities along with all obligations of the Trust under the trust agreement relating to the Capital Securities. The Trust is not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities (formerly FIN 46(R)). Debenture interest payments on the Carver Statutory Trust I capital securities have been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, which is permissible under the terms of the Indenture for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods, as the Company is prohibited from making payments without prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank. During the 
 3

second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments were made in September 2016. The total amount of deferred interest was $1.7 million at March 31, 2019. 

The Company relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by Carver Federal to the Company, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the "FRB") regulates dividends paid by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Agreement, Carver Federal is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There are no assurances that dividend payments to the Company will resume. 
Personnel
At fiscal year end 2019, the Company had 114 employees. None of the Company's employees are a member of a collective bargaining agreement.

Lending Activities
General.  Carver Federal's loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage loans originated by the Bank's lending teams and secured by commercial real estate including multifamily property and construction loans. Substantially all of the Bank's mortgage loans are secured by properties located within the Bank's market area. From time to time, the Bank may purchase loans that comply with the Bank's underwriting standards from other financial institutions or in contiguous market geographies to achieve loan growth objectives and improve geographic diversity. 
In recent years, Carver Federal had focused on the origination of commercial real estate loans, primarily multifamily and mixed-use commercial loans. These loans generally have higher yields and shorter maturities than one-to-four family residential properties, and include prepayment penalties that the Bank collects if the loans pay in full prior to the contractual maturity. The Bank's increased emphasis on portfolio management and monitoring of the commercial real estate and multifamily residential mortgage loans was required given the increase of the overall level of credit risk inherent in this market segment. Due to the overall improvement in the loan portfolio, the Bank was able to recover provisions for loan losses in years 2013 to 2015. However, the greater risk associated with commercial real estate, particularly multifamily residential loans, as well as the growth in this type of loan, had required the Bank to increase its provisions for loan losses in fiscal years 2016 to 2018. In fiscal year 2019, the Bank's recoveries on previously charged off loans exceeded its chargeoffs to such an extent that additional provisions were not necessary. The Bank could be required to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained. Carver Federal continually reviews the composition of its mortgage loan portfolio and underwriting standards to manage the risk in the portfolio. Per the requirements of the Formal Agreement, the Bank has reduced its commercial real estate loan concentration as a percentage of risk-based capital to a level well below that mandated by its regulators.

Loan Portfolio Composition. Total loans receivable decreased $48.4 million, or 10.2%, to $425.8 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $474.2 million at March 31, 2018. Although total loans decreased, Carver Federal's total loans receivable as a percentage of total assets increased to 75.5% at March 31, 2019, compared to 68.3% at March 31, 2018. 
The following is a summary of loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, as of:

One-to-four Family Residential Lending. Carver Federal purchases first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner. The Bank did not purchase any one-to-four family loans during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. In fiscal 2017, the Bank purchased $13.9 million of one-to-four family loans. Approximately 18.7% of the one-to-four family residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at March 31, 2019 were adjustable rate and approximately 81.3% were fixed-rate. One-to-four family residential real estate loans decreased $12.9 million, or 10.6%, to $108.4 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $121.2 million at March 31, 2018. 
Carver Federal's fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale. From time to time, the Bank has sold such loans to Fannie Mae, the State of New York Mortgage Agency (“SONYMA”) and other third parties. Loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to SONYMA where the sale is made with servicing released. Carver Federal uses a servicing firm to sub-service mortgage loans, whether held in portfolio or sold with servicing retained. At March 31, 2019, the Bank, through its sub-servicer, serviced $18.8 million in loans for FNMA and $561 thousand for other third parties. The Bank has recorded $180 thousand in related mortgage servicing rights.
The retention of adjustable-rate loans in Carver Federal's portfolio helps reduce Carver Federal's exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of adjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Although adjustable-rate loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on the Bank's adjustable-rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the Bank's cost of funds. Adjustable-rate loans increase the Bank's exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates, although decreases in the Bank's cost of funds would tend to offset this effect to an extent.
The Bank previously originated or purchased a limited amount of subprime loans (which are defined by the Bank as those loans where the borrowers have FICO scores of 660 or less at origination). At March 31, 2019, the Bank had $5.4 million in subprime loans, or 1.3% of its total loan portfolio, of which $1.6 million are non-performing loans. 
Multifamily Real Estate Lending. Traditionally, Carver Federal originates and purchases multifamily loans. Multifamily property lending entails additional risks compared to one-to-four family residential lending. For example, such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market 
 5

for multifamily residential units. Carver Federal's multifamily real estate loan portfolio decreased $17.7 million, or 17.0%, to $86.2 million in fiscal 2019, or 20.2% of Carver Federal's total loan portfolio at March 31, 2019. 
In making multifamily real estate loans, the Bank primarily considers the property's ability to generate net operating income sufficient to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower. Carver Federal's multifamily real estate product guidelines generally require that the maximum loan-to-value ("LTV") at origination not exceed 75% based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property on all such loans. The Bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at least 1.20 on multifamily real estate loans, which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment. Carver Federal originates and purchases multifamily real estate loans, which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a 15-, 20-, 25-, or 30-year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years, or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for additional periods. The Bank occasionally originates fixed rate loans with greater than five year terms. Personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers. 
To help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multifamily real estate loans, Carver Federal employs a risk rating system for its loans. All commercial loans, including multifamily real estate loans, are risk rated internally at the time of origination.  Management continually monitors all commercial loans in order to update risk ratings when necessary (see "Asset Classification and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" for additional information on asset classification and risk ratings). In addition, to assist the Bank in evaluating changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral, an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of our commercial loan relationships.  On a quarterly basis: i) all new/renewed loans greater than $500,000, ii) a sampling of loans $100,000 to $999,999, and iii) all criticized and classified loans, are reviewed.  In addition, on an annual basis, all loans greater than $500,000 and a sampling of loans $100,000 to $499,999 are reviewed.  Summary reports documenting the loan reviews are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole.
Commercial Real Estate Lending. Commercial real estate lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office, mixed-use (properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial), retail and church buildings in the Bank's market area. Mixed-use loans are secured by properties that are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as commercial real estate ("CRE"). Although Carver has experienced favorable loss history associated with commercial real estate loans, these loans may entail additional risks compared with one-to-four family residential and multifamily lending. For example, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property.
In originating CRE loans, the Bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower. Carver Federal's maximum LTV ratio on commercial real estate mortgage loans at origination is generally 75% based on the latest appraised value of the mortgaged property. The Bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at least 1.20 on commercial real estate loans. The Bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants' leases in the mortgaged property and personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers. 
At March 31, 2019, commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled $130.8 million, or 30.7% of the total loan portfolio. This balance reflects a year-over-year decrease of $11.0 million, or 7.8%, as the targeted reduction of the Bank's concentration in commercial real estate mortgage loans, which occurred in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, affected the Bank's ability to originate new loans in fiscal year 2019. 
The Bank offers 5-year terms for our commercial mortgages. At times, we can offer greater than 5 years for terms of up to 15 years and amortization schedules up to 25 years; however, the interest rate always resets every 5 years. Interest rates currently offered by the Bank are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period and generally are based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding regular advance rate. 
Historically, Carver Federal has been a New York City metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches. At March 31, 2019, loans to churches totaled $10.2 million, or 2.4% of the Bank's gross loan portfolio. These loans generally have five-, seven-, or ten-year terms with 15-, 20- or 25-year amortization periods, a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a 70% LTV ratio at origination. The Bank has also provided construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction. There are currently seven church loans in the Bank's loan portfolio. 
 6

Loans secured by real estate owned by faith-based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church's congregation, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including reviewing the organization's financial condition, limiting the size of such loans and establishing the quality of the collateral securing such loans. The Bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization, the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis to determine the church's ability to service the proposed loan. Carver Federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and/or key person life insurance on the pastor. The Bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church's leadership. While asset quality in the church loan category historically has been one of the strongest asset classes, recent economic conditions have produced higher delinquencies in this portfolio. While management believes that Carver Federal will remain a leading lender to churches in its market area, Carver Federal will continue to conduct disciplined underwriting and maintain focused portfolio management.
Construction Lending. The Bank has historically originated or participated in construction loans for new construction and renovation of multifamily buildings, residential developments, community service facilities, churches, and affordable housing programs. The Bank's construction loans generally have adjustable interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards as the Bank's mortgage loans on existing properties. The loans provide for disbursement in stages as construction is completed. Participation in construction loans may be at various stages of funding. Construction terms are usually from 12 to 24 months. The construction loan interest is capitalized as part of the overall project cost and is funded monthly from the loan proceeds. Borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that apply to the Bank's permanent mortgage loan financing for the mortgaged property. Carver Federal has additional criteria for construction loans including an engineer's plan and periodic cost reviews on all construction budgets for loans in excess of $250,000.
At March 31, 2019, the Bank had no construction loans outstanding. At this time, the Bank is not actively engaged in the origination or purchase of construction loans. 
Business Loans.  Carver Federal's small business (Commercial and Industrial, or "C&I") lending portfolio decreased $5.6 million to $96.4 million, comprising 22.6% of the Bank's gross loan portfolio in fiscal 2019. In a strategic attempt to diversify the Bank's loan portfolio, Carver Federal demonstrated a renewed emphasis on C&I lending, placing particular focus on organic loan growth through the financing of local entrepreneurs during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Carver Federal provides revolving credit, working capital and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately $1 million to $25 million in educational, health care, personal services, and light industrial and wholesale segments. Business loans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners and may also be secured by additional collateral, including real estate, equipment and inventory.
Consumer and Other Loans. At March 31, 2019, the Bank had $4.0 million in consumer and other loans, or 0.9%, of the Bank's gross loan portfolio, primarily comprised of $4.7 million of guaranteed graduate medical student loans purchased in fiscal 2017. 
Consumer loans are not typically secured by collateral and therefore involve more risk than first mortgage loans. Collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by changes in employment, marital status, health and other personal financial factors. Further, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered. These loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against Carver Federal, including claims and defenses that the borrower has against the seller of the underlying collateral. In underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards, Carver Federal considers the borrower's credit history, an analysis of the borrower's income, expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral. The underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral. See “Asset Quality-Non-performing Assets.”
Loan Processing. Carver Federal's loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including referrals by realtors, builders, depositors, borrowers and mortgage brokers, as well as walk-in and telephone customers. Loans are originated by the Bank's personnel who receive a base salary, commissions and other incentive compensation. Real estate, business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the Bank's Lending Department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in Carver Federal's loan policy. The underwriting and loan processing for residential one-to-four family loans are performed by an outsourced third party loan originator using lending standards established by the Bank.
A commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multifamily and non-residential properties that the Bank finances. Prior to loan approval, the property is inspected by a loan officer. As part of the loan approval process, consideration 
 7

is given to an independent appraisal, location, accessibility, stability of the neighborhood, environmental assessment, personal credit history and the financial capacity of the applicant(s). Business loan applications are completed for all business loans. Most business loans are secured by real estate, personal guarantees, and/or guarantees by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) or Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) filings. The loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant, collateral, cash flow and purpose and stability of the business.
Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant's income and credit standing.  It is the Bank's policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the Bank.
It is Carver Federal's policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and, when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, obtain flood insurance. Most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance. Written confirmation of the guarantee for SBA loans and evidence of the UCC filing is also required.
Loan Approval. Except for real estate and business loans in excess of $6.0 million, mortgage and business loan approval authority has been delegated by the Bank's Board of Directors to the Board's Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Committee. The Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Committee has delegated to the Bank's Management Loan Committee, which consists of certain members of executive management, loan approval authority up to and including $1.0 million for real estate and business loans. Real estate and business loans above $6.0 million must be approved by the full Board. Purchased loans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans. One-to-four family mortgage loans that conform to FNMA, Federal Housing Administration and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") standards and limits may be approved by the outsourced third party loan originator. 
Loans-to-One-Borrower. Under the loans-to-one-borrower limits of the OCC, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of a savings bank. See “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations.” At March 31, 2019, the maximum loans-to-one-borrower under this test was $10.2 million and the Bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit.
Loan Originations and Purchases. Loan originations were $27.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $21.0 million in fiscal 2018. There were no loan purchases during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. 
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to Carver Federal's loan originations and advances, purchases and sales for the fiscal years ended March 31:

Loans purchased by the Bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the Bank originates. The Bank's purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse to the seller, with certain exceptions related to the seller's compliance with representations and warranties, and in accordance with the Bank's underwriting criteria for originations. In addition, purchased loans have a variety of terms, including maturities, interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates, that may differ from those offered at that time by the Bank. The Bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area. However, the Bank may purchase loans secured by property outside its market area to meet its financial objectives. The market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from Carver Federal's market area and may be subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in Carver Federal's market area. There can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out-of-state markets will not deteriorate in the future, resulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas.
In an effort to reduce risks, the Bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the Bank's underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the Bank. A review of each loan is conducted prior to purchase, and the Bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring, in each buy/sell agreement, a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents. These warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan. Any misrepresentation must be cured within 90 days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy/sell agreement.
Loan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth information at March 31, 2019 regarding the amount of loans maturing in Carver Federal's portfolio, including scheduled repayments of principal, based on contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. The table below does not include any estimate of prepayments, which significantly shorten the average life of all mortgage loans and may cause Carver Federal's actual repayment experience to differ significantly from that shown below:

Loan Maturities

One-to-four family | $ | 1 | | | $ | 1,151 | | $ | 107,211 | $ | 108,363

Total | $ | 44,456 | | | $ | 164,482 | | $ | 216,867 | $ | 425,805

The following table sets forth as of March 31, 2019, amounts in each loan category that are contractually due after March 31, 2020 and whether such loans have fixed or adjustable interest rates. Scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of such assets. The average life of long-term loans is substantially less than their contractual terms due to prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give Carver Federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event, among other things, that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans:

Asset Quality
General. One of the Bank's key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality. Through a variety of strategies, including, but not limited to, monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements, the Bank has been proactive in addressing problem loans and non-performing assets. 
The underlying credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower's ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan. For non-owner occupied non-residential real estate and multifamily real estate loans, the borrower's ability to pay typically is dependent on rental income, which can be impacted primarily by vacancies and general market conditions. For one-to-four family loans, a borrowers' ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income. For owner occupied non-residential real estate, a borrower's ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on the success of the borrower's business. For all of the Bank's loans, a borrower's ability to pay is also impacted by general economic and other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, are also impacted by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, demographics, maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays.
Non-performing Assets. Non-performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans held-for-sale, and property acquired in settlement of loans (OREO), including foreclosure. When a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan, the Bank and/or its loan servicers take prompt steps to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status. This includes a series of actions such as phone calls, letters, customer visits and, if necessary, legal action. In the event the loan has a guarantee, the Bank may seek to recover on the guarantee, including, where applicable, from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Loans that remain delinquent are reviewed for reserve provisions and charge-off. The Bank's collection efforts continue after the loan is charged off, except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not productive.
The Bank may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower's loan. In cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until the Bank determines that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for a period of at least six months. At March 31, 2019, loans classified as TDR totaled $5.4 million, of which $2.2 million were classified as performing.
The following table sets forth information with respect to Carver Federal's non-performing assets, which includes nonaccrual loans, loans held-for-sale, and property acquired in settlement of loans as of March 31:

(1) | Nonaccrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds 90 days past due, or in the opinion of management, the collection of contractual interest and/or principal is doubtful. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on assessment of the ability to collect on the loan. 


(2) | Other non-performing assets generally represent loans that the Bank is in the process of selling and has designated held-for-sale or property acquired by the Bank in settlement of loans less costs to sell (i.e. through foreclosure, repossession or as an in-substance foreclosure). These assets are recorded at the lower of their cost or fair value.

(3) | Troubled debt restructured loans performing in accordance with their modified terms for less than six months and those not performing in accordance with their modified terms are considered nonaccrual and are included in the nonaccrual category in the table above. TDR loans included in the nonaccrual category above totaled $3.2 million at 2019, $1.9 million at 2018, $2.5 million at 2017, $2.2 million at 2016, and $3.6 million at 2015. TDR loans that have performed in accordance with their modified terms for a period of at least six months are generally considered performing loans and are not presented in the table above. Performing TDR loans were $2.2 million at 2019, $3.8 million at 2018, $3.9 million at 2017, $5.6 million at 2016, and $4.6 million at 2015. 

At March 31, 2019, total non-performing assets increased by $2.9 million, or 37.0%, to $10.7 million, compared to $7.8 million at March 31, 2018 as a result of a $3.6 million increase in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by a $741 thousand decrease in real estate owned, year over year. Nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2019 consisted of sixteen one-to-four family loans, nine small business and SBA loans, five multifamily loans, four commercial real estate loans, and three consumer loans. The increase in delinquent loans from the prior year is primarily due to an increase in impaired business and multifamily loans. Management believes that there may be losses associated with certain delinquent loans in the future, but also notes that the amount of losses may be reduced by the value of properties securing these delinquent loans and the Bank's loan loss reserves. Other non-performing assets at year-end 2019 includes real estate owned assets consisting of four properties foreclosed upon. At March 31, 2019, Carver had 14 loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate properties in the process of foreclosure with a total outstanding balance of $4.2 million.
Although we believe that substantially all risk elements at March 31, 2019 have been disclosed, it is possible that for a variety of reasons, including economic conditions, certain borrowers may be unable to comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real estate and commercial loans. For additional information about certain factors that may affect the future performance of the Company's loan portfolio, please see "Item 1A - Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Statements."
Asset Classification and Allowances for Losses. Federal regulations and the Bank's policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis. An asset is classified as “substandard” if it is determined to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged, if any. An asset is classified as “doubtful” if full collection is highly questionable or improbable. An asset is classified as “loss” if it is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future.  The regulations also provide for a “special mention” designation, described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention.  Assets classified as substandard or doubtful result in a higher level of allowances for loan losses recorded in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies.” If an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss, a savings institution must charge off any amount exceeding the fair value of collateral pursuant to loan impairment guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35. If a savings institution does not agree with an examiner's classification of an asset, it may appeal this determination to the OCC Regional Director.
The OCC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses ("ALLL"). The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. Management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements. The evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis, but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management's prompt attention, such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non-performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend. Although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary. For additional information regarding Carver Federal's ALLL policy, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
The Board has designated the Credit Review Committee of management to perform a review on a quarterly basis of the Bank's asset quality, determine and properly identify and monitor credit risk in the loan portfolio and determine that the Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses is proper and appropriate and submit their report to the Board for review. Carver Federal's methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur.  Further, management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly. Although 
 11

management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations, or if circumstances pertaining to individual loans change, or new information pertaining to individual loans or the loan portfolio is identified. The Bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers, each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans.  The Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Committees of the Board establish policy relating to internal classification of loans and also provides input to the Credit Review Committee in its review of classified assets.  In originating loans, Carver Federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the security for the loan.
It is management's policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality, character and size, the Bank's and the industry's historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions and certain qualitative factors. In addition, considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate market. See “Lending Activities-Loan Purchases and Originations.” Carver Federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses against the Bank's income. General allowances are established by management on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the Bank's loans, taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency trends, current charge-off and loss experience, the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally. Specific allowances are provided for individual loans, or portions of loans, when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan. A loan is deemed impaired when it is probable the Bank will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Loans the Bank individually classifies as impaired include multifamily mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and business loans which have been classified by the Bank's credit review officer as substandard, doubtful or loss for which it is probable that principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the loan's contractual terms, and certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. A charge off is recognized on collateral dependent loans when the fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan, if any, is less than the recorded investment in the loan. A valuation allowance for cash flow dependent loans is established when based upon a discounted cash flow analysis, impairment is demonstrated.
At the date of foreclosure or other repossession, the Bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans, or other real estate owned ("OREO"), at fair value less estimated selling costs.  Fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash-equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.  Any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses prior to the transfer of the property into OREO.  Carver Federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure.  Subsequent to taking possession of the property, management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property, less estimated costs to sell, declines.  If, upon ultimate disposition of the property, net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property, a gain on sale of real estate is recorded, providing the Bank did not provide financing for the sale.
The following table sets forth an analysis of Carver Federal's allowance for loan losses at and for the years ended March 31:

Investment Activities
General.  The Bank utilizes mortgage-backed and other investment securities in its asset/liability management strategy.  In making investment decisions, the Bank considers, among other things, its yield and interest rate objectives, its interest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow.
Generally, the investment policy of the Bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the Bank's asset/liability management policies, investment quality, loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements, liquidity needs and performance objectives.  Securities are classified into one of three categories: trading, held-to-maturity, and available-for-sale.  Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.  Debt securities for which 
 13

the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost.  All other securities not classified as trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included, on an after-tax basis, in a separate component of stockholders' equity.  At March 31, 2019, the Bank had no securities classified as trading.  At March 31, 2019, $79.8 million, or 87.3% of the Bank's mortgage-backed and other investment securities, were classified as available-for-sale.  The remaining $11.1 million, or 12.2%, were classified as held-to-maturity.
The following table sets forth the amortized cost, fair value and weighted average yields of the Bank's investment portfolio at March 31, 2019, categorized by remaining period to contractual maturity:

Mortgage-Backed Securities. The Bank has invested in mortgage-backed securities to help achieve its asset/liability management goals and collateral needs.  Although mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than whole loans, they present substantially lower credit risk, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the Bank.  Because Carver Federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage-backed securities, these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities, which generally only pay principal at maturity.  Mortgage-backed securities also help the Bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws.  See “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Qualified Thrift Lender Test” and “Federal and State Taxation.”
Mortgage-backed securities constituted 9.3% of total assets at March 31, 2019, compared to 6.2% at March 31, 2018. Carver Federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the form of Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) pass-through certificates, FNMA, FHLMC participation certificates and commercial mortgage-backed securities.  GNMA pass-through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, while FNMA and FHLMC certificates are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest.  Mortgage-backed securities generally entitle Carver Federal to receive a pro-rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages.  The cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity.  Carver Federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the SBA.
 14

The Bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities, which at March 31, 2019, constituted $3.6 million, or 7.0%, of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio.  Mortgage-backed securities, however, expose Carver Federal to certain unique risks.  In a declining rate environment, accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose Carver Federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds.  In the event the mortgage-backed security has been funded with an interest-bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage-backed security, the Bank's interest rate spread could be adversely affected.  Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, the Bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment on the underlying mortgages, effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage-backed security and exposing the Bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest.  For additional information regarding Carver Federal's mortgage-backed securities portfolio and its maturities refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investment Securities.”
Other Investment Securities.  In addition to mortgage-backed securities, the Bank also invests in assets such as government and agency obligations, corporate bonds and mutual funds. Carver Federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments, including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB-NY, certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions, certain bankers' acceptances and federal funds.  The Bank may also invest, subject to certain limitations, in commercial paper having one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency, and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 
Other Earning Assets. Federal regulations require the Bank to maintain an investment in FHLB-NY stock and a sufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities.  For additional information, see “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Liquidity.”
Securities Impairment.  The Bank’s available-for-sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Securities that the Bank has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The fair values of securities in the Bank's portfolio are based on published or securities dealers’ market values and are affected by changes in interest rates. On a quarterly basis, the Bank reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. The Bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with its experience. Following FASB guidance, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment when there are credit and non-credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell, and for which it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non-credit impairment, the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings. The remaining difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive income (loss). This guidance also requires additional disclosures about investments in an unrealized loss position and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank recognized an impairment of less than $500 on a mortgage-backed security. The Bank did not have any securities that were classified as having other-than-temporary impairment in its investment portfolio at March 31, 2019. 
Sources of Funds
General.  Deposits are the primary source of Carver Federal's funds for lending and other investment purposes.  In addition to deposits, Carver Federal derives funds from loan principal repayments, loan and investment interest payments, maturing investments and fee income.  Loan and mortgage-backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates, pricing of deposits, competition and general economic conditions.  Borrowed money may be used to supplement the Bank's available funds, and from time to time the Bank borrows funds from the FHLB-NY and has borrowed funds through trust preferred debt securities.
Deposits.  Carver Federal attracts deposits from consumers, businesses, non-profit organizations and public entities through its eight branches principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including passbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit, which range in term from 91 days to five years.  Deposit terms vary, principally on the basis of the minimum balance required, the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.  Carver Federal also offers Individual Retirement Accounts.  Carver Federal's policies are designed primarily to attract deposits from local residents and businesses through the Bank's branches.  Carver Federal also holds deposits from various governmental agencies or authorities and corporations.
 15

Carver Federal utilizes brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of the Bank's interest rate risk. Carver Federal has obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below the prevailing interest rate for non-brokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them allowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, when we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Carver has obtained brokered deposits from a variety of brokerage firms.  In addition, Carver has obtained brokered deposits through the Depository Trust Company.  This allows us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk. Carver Federal has also utilized brokers to obtain money market account deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts is the same or below the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts. These accounts are similar to brokered certificates of deposit accounts in that we only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker maintaining the detailed records of each depositor. As of March 31, 2019, Carver had a total of $85.0 million in brokered deposits, compared to $126.4 million as of March 31, 2018.  
As of March 31, 2019, the Bank has $48.3 million of reciprocal deposits acquired through its participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). The Bank's CDARS deposits totaled $48.2 million as of March 31, 2018. The CDARS network arranges for placement of Carver Federal's customer funds into certificate of deposit accounts issued by other CDARS member banks. The certificate of deposit accounts are in increments of less than the individual FDIC insurance limit amount, to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full FDIC deposit insurance. This allows the Bank to maintain its customer relationship while still providing its customers with FDIC insurance for the full amount of their deposits, up to $50 million per customer. In exchange, Carver Federal receives from other member banks their customers' deposits in like amounts. Depositors are allowed to withdraw funds early, with a penalty, from these accounts. Carver Federal may elect to participate in the program by making or receiving deposits without making or receiving a reciprocal deposit. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the standard maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000.
Deposit interest rates, maturities, service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposits are established based on the Bank's funds acquisition and liquidity requirements, the rates paid by the Bank's competitors, current market rates, the Bank's growth goals and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements.  For additional information regarding the Bank's deposit accounts and the related weighted average interest rates paid, and amount and maturities of certificates of deposit in specified weighted average interest rate categories, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Deposits.”
Borrowed Funds.  While deposits are the primary source of funds for Carver Federal's lending, investment and general operating activities, Carver Federal is authorized to use advances from the FHLB-NY and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“Repos”) from approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements.  The FHLB-NY functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions.  As a member of the FHLB system, Carver Federal is required to own stock in the FHLB-NY and is authorized to apply for advances.  Advances are made pursuant to several different programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities.  Advances from the FHLB-NY are secured by Carver Federal's stock in the FHLB-NY and a pledge of Carver Federal's mortgage loan and mortgage-backed and agency securities portfolios. The Bank takes into consideration the term of borrowed money with the repricing cycle of the mortgage loans on the balance sheet.  At March 31, 2019, Carver had $8.0 million in FHLB-NY advances outstanding. 
On September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares, liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of floating rate capital securities.  Gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities of $13 million, and proceeds from the sale of the trust's common securities of $0.4 million, were used to purchase approximately $13.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due 2033.  The trust preferred debt securities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the Company and have a mandatory redemption date of September 17, 2033.  Cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum resetting quarterly with a margin of 3.05% over the three-month LIBOR, with a rate of 5.7% at March 31, 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures has been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, per the terms of the agreement, which permit such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is prohibited from making payments without prior regulatory approval. 
Carver relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by Carver Federal to the Company, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure 
 16

to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Agreement, Carver Federal is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There are no assurances that dividend payments to Carver will resume. 
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
Enforcement Actions
On October 23, 2015 the Board of Directors of Carver Bancorp, Inc., in response to the FRB’s Bank Holding Company Report of Inspection issued on April 14, 2015, adopted a Board Resolution (“the Resolution”) as a commitment by the Company’s Board to address certain supervisory concerns noted in the Reserve Bank‘s Report. The supervisory concerns are related to the Company’s leverage, cash flow and accumulated deferred interest. As a result of those concerns, the Company is prohibited from paying any dividends without the prior written approval of the Reserve Bank.
On May 24, 2016, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement (the "Agreement") with the OCC to undertake certain compliance-related and other actions as further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 27, 2016. As a result of the Formal Agreement, the Bank must obtain the approval of the OCC prior to effecting any change in its directors or senior executive officers. The Bank may not declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions, including to the Company, without first filing an application with the OCC and receiving the prior approval of the OCC. Furthermore, the Bank must seek the OCC's written approval and the FDIC's written concurrence before entering into any "golden parachute payments" as that term is defined under 12 U.S.C. § 1828(k) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359. 
General
The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the OCC. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and is a member of the FHLB. The Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. The Company, as a unitary savings and loan holding company, is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the FRB and is required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the FRB and of the SEC under the federal securities laws. The OCC periodically performs safety and soundness examinations of the Bank and tests compliance with various regulatory requirements. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, particularly with respect to its capital requirements. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Director of the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and, if action is not taken by the Director, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances.
The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding companies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company. Any change in such laws and regulations whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and the Company and their operations and stockholders.
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act') made extensive changes in the regulation of federal savings banks. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the OCC became primarily responsible for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks. Likewise, the FRB became responsible for supervision of savings and loan holding companies. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the FRB. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as Carver Federal Savings Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and are subject to the primary enforcement authority of, their prudential regulator rather than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, also required changes in the way that institutions were assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, required that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, directed the FRB to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees, reduced the federal preemption afforded to federal savings associations and contained a number 
 17

of reforms related to mortgage originations. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act contained delayed effective dates and/or required the issuance of regulations. As a result, it will be some time before their impact on operations can be fully assessed by management. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in an increased regulatory burden and higher compliance, operating, and possibly, interest costs for the Bank and the Company.
Capital and Liquidity
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is authorized and, in some cases, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks. For this purpose, a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank's regulatory capital: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized.
The severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank's capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories. All banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if, following such distribution, the bank would be undercapitalized. Generally, a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution, including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion. Under OCC regulations, as amended, a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well-capitalized if its total risk-based capital ratio is 10% or greater, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 8% or greater, its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is 6.5% or greater, and its leverage ratio is 5% or greater, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the OCC to meet a specific capital level. In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions as they deem necessary.  
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, or FDICIA, required that the OCC and other federal banking agencies revise their risk-based capital standards, with appropriate transition rules, to ensure that they take into account IRR concentration of risk and the risks of non-traditional activities.  The OCC regulations do not include a specific IRR component of the risk-based capital requirement.  However, the OCC monitors the IRR of individual institutions through a variety of means, including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value ("NPV").  NPV is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity's assets and liabilities and, therefore, hypothetically represents the value of an institution's net worth.  The OCC has also used this NPV analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions.  In addition, OCC Bulletin 2010-1 provides guidance on the management of IRR and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area.  The OCC, through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations, retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the OCC regarding NPV analysis.  
Carver Federal's Capital Position. Carver Federal, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed minimum requirements and are consistent with Carver Federal's risk profile. At March 31, 2019, Carver Federal exceeded the capital regulatory requirements and its Individual Minimum Capital Requirements with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.39%, Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.77%, total risk-based capital ratio of 16.58% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.39%. 
The OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule effective January 1, 2015 that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule generally applies to all depository institutions, and top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $3 billion or more. Among other things, the rule established a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also required unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Carver Federal has chosen to opt-out. Additional constraints are also imposed on the inclusion in regulatory capital of certain mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and minority interests. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As noted, the final rule became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in annually beginning January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2019, the full capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% became effective. The final rule 
 18

adjusted the prompt corrective action categories described above to incorporate the increased capital standards and established the "well-capitalized" threshold described above. 
Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10%. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement and electing the alternative framework will be considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements and the prompt corrective action categories would be adjusted accordingly. The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators and the regulators proposed a rule in December 2018 that would set the community bank leverage ratio at 9%.
Limitation on Capital Distributions.  There are various restrictions on a bank's ability to make capital distributions, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital. A savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before making a capital distribution. The Bank must also file an application or notice for prior approval with the OCC if the total amount of its capital distributions (including each proposed distribution), for the applicable calendar year would exceed the Bank's net income for that year plus the Bank's retained net income for the previous two years, if the Bank is not an "eligible savings association" as defined in OCC regulations or the capital distributions would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
The Bank may be prohibited from making capital distributions and its application or notice disapproved if:

(1) | the Bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;


(2) | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or


(3) | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.

Liquidity.  The Bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs.  In the normal course of business, the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating, investing and financing activities.  Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less are the Bank's most liquid assets.  The Bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations. Management believes Carver Federal’s short-term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand, potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements, including interest payments on our subordinated debt securities. 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The OCC has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards.  The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.  In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.  OCC regulations authorize the OCC to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan.  If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the OCC must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of federal law.  If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the OCC may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
Enforcement.  The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over the Bank.  This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.  In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008 and authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) to purchase certain troubled assets from financial institutions, including banks and thrifts.  Under the TARP, the Treasury could purchase residential and commercial mortgages, and securities, obligations or other instruments based on such mortgages, originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008 that the Secretary of the Treasury determines promotes market stability, as well as any other financial 
 19

instrument that the Treasury, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or FRB, determined the purchase of which is necessary to promote market stability.  In the case of a publicly-traded financial institution that sold troubled assets into the TARP, the Treasury must have received a warrant giving the Treasury the right to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution, or voting stock with respect to which the Treasury agreed not to exercise voting power, subject to certain de minimis exceptions.  In addition, all financial institutions that sold troubled assets to the TARP and met certain conditions were also subject to certain executive compensation restrictions, which differed depending on how the troubled assets were acquired under the TARP.
On October 14, 2008, the Treasury announced that it would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts. Under this program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the "TARP CPP"), the Treasury made $250 billion of capital available (from the $700 billion authorized by the EESA) to U.S. financial institutions in the form of preferred stock. In conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock, the Treasury received warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15% of the preferred investment.  Participating financial institutions were required to adopt the Treasury's standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the Treasury held equity issued under the TARP CPP.  On January 20, 2009, the Company announced that it completed the sale of $18.98 million in preferred stock to the Treasury in connection with Carver's participation in the TARP CPP. Importantly, Carver is exempt from the requirement to issue a warrant to the Treasury to purchase shares of common stock, as the Bank is a certified Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) conducting most of its depository and lending activities in disadvantaged communities. Therefore, the investment did not dilute common stockholders. As a participant in TARP CPP, the Company was subject to certain obligations currently in effect, such as compensation restrictions, a luxury expenditure policy, the requirement the Company include a “say on pay” proposal in the proxy statement and certain certifications. The Company was also subject to additional restrictions or obligations as may be imposed under TARP CPP for as long as the Company participates in TARP CPP.
The Treasury announced in February 2010 the implementation of the Community Development Capital Initiative (“CDCI”). This new capital program invested lower cost capital in CDFIs that lend to small businesses in the country's most economically depressed communities. CDFI banks and thrifts are eligible to receive investments of capital with an initial dividend rate of 2%, compared to the 5% rate offered under the CPP. CDFIs could apply to receive capital up to 5% of risk-weighted assets. To encourage repayment while recognizing the unique circumstances facing CDFIs, the dividend rate increased to 9% after eight years, compared to five years under TARP preferred stock. On August 27, 2010, Carver completed with the Treasury the exchange of the $18.98 million of TARP preferred stock for an equivalent amount of CDCI Series B preferred stock. As stated above, on October 28, 2011, the U.S. Treasury exchanged the CDCI Series B preferred stock for 2,321,286 shares of Company common stock.
Other Supervision and Regulation
Activity Powers.  The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners' Loan Act (“HOLA”), as amended, and federal regulations.  Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets.  The Bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage.  The Bank's authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law. These investment powers are subject to various limitations, including (1) a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories, (2) a limit of 400% of an association's capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non-residential real estate property, (3) a limit of 20% of an association's assets on commercial loans, with the amount of commercial loans in excess of 10% of assets being limited to small business loans, (4) a limit of 35% of an association's assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities, (5) a limit of 5% of assets on non-conforming loans (loans in excess of the specific limitations of HOLA), and (6) a limit of the greater of 5% of assets or an association's capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property.
Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations.  The Bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans-to-one borrower as a national bank.  With specified exceptions, the Bank's total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed 15% of the Bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income.  The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one borrower limitations.  At March 31, 2019, the Bank's limit on loans-to-one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was $10.2 million.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test.  Under HOLA, the Bank must comply with a Qualified Thrift Lender (“QTL”) test.  Under this test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in certain “qualified thrift investments” on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve-month period.  “Portfolio assets” means, in general, an association's total 
 20

assets less the sum of (a) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (b) goodwill and other intangible assets and (c) the value of property used to conduct the Bank's business.  “Qualified thrift investments” include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to such purposes, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities and consumer loans.  If the Bank fails the QTL test, it must operate under certain restrictions on its activities. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance potentially subject to agency enforcement action for violation of law.  At March 31, 2019, the Bank maintained approximately 98.8% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments.  The Bank had also met the QTL test in each of the prior 12 months and was, therefore, a qualified thrift lender.
Branching.  Subject to certain limitations, federal law permits the Bank to establish branches in any state of the United States.  The authority for the Bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the Bank's activities.  This authority under federal law and regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations.
Community Reinvestment.  Under CRA, as amended, as implemented by OCC regulations, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the Bank nor does it limit the Bank's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community.  CRA does, however, require the OCC, in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess the Bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank.
In particular, the system focuses on three tests:

(1) | a lending test, to evaluate the institution's record of making loans in its assessment areas;


(2) | an investment test, to evaluate the institution's record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and


(3) | a service test, to evaluate the institution's delivery of banking services through its branches, ATM centers and other offices.

CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings.  The Bank received an “Outstanding” CRA rating in its most recent examination conducted in January 2019. 
Regulations require that Carver Federal publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of CRA.  The Company has no such agreements in place at this time.
Transactions with Related Parties.  The Bank's authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by federal regulations and by Sections 23A, 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”).  In general, these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the Bank as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.  Additionally, certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the Bank's capital.  Collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates to receive loans from the Bank.  In addition, OCC regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
The Bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and 10% shareholders ("insiders"), as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board.  Among other things, these provisions require that all loans or extensions of credit to insiders (a) be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (b) not exceed certain limitations, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank's capital.  In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank's Board.  The aggregate amount of related party deposits were $5.0 million and there was 1 related party loan totaling $80 thousand at March 31, 2019.
Assessment. The OCC charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates.  These assessments are based on three components: the size of the association, on which the basic assessment is based; the association's supervisory condition, which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 in its most recent safety and soundness examination; and the complexity of the association's operations, which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment 
 21

for any savings association that managed over $1 billion in trust assets, serviced for others loans aggregating more than $1 billion, or had certain off-balance sheet assets aggregating more than $1 billion.  For fiscal 2019, Carver paid $314 thousand in regulatory assessments.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
Under the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution's failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed into risk categories. 
The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution's total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion of total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016.
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act requires insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% 5o 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions were subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. The FDIC has indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets will receive credits for their portion of assets that contributed to raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.
The FDIC has authority to further increase insurance assessments and therefore management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. A significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. For fiscal 2019, Carver paid $638 thousand in FDIC insurance.
Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification
  The Bank is subject to federal regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”).  The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.  By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act took measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.  Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended.
Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related federal regulations imposed the following requirements with respect to financial institutions:

• | Establish a Board approved policy and perform a risk assessment of BSA, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC;


• | Designate a qualified BSA officer;


• | Establish an effective training program;


• | Establish anti-money laundering programs;


• | Establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;


• | Establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and

 22


• | Prohibit correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks

In addition, bank regulators were directed to consider a holding company's effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on certain corporate applications.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY, which is one of the eleven regional banks composing the FHLB System.  Each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions.  The Bank, as a FHLB-NY member, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB-NY in specified amounts.  The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2019 of $926 thousand.  Any advances from the FHLB-NY must be secured by specified types of collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance.
FHLB-NY is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs.  These requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the FHLB-NY can pay as dividends to its members and could also result in the FHLB-NY imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members.  If dividends were reduced, or interest on future FHLB-NY advances increased, the Bank's net interest income would be adversely affected.  Dividends from FHLB-NY to the Bank amounted to $42 thousand and $109 thousand for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The dividend rate paid on FHLB-NY stock at March 31, 2019 was 6.4%.
Federal Reserve System
FRB regulations require federally chartered savings associations to maintain non-interest-earning cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing checking and demand deposit accounts). A reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $16.3 million and $124.2 million (subject to adjustment annually by the FRB) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the FRB between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment annually by the FRB) is exempt from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. Since required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce Carver Federal's interest-earning assets. FHLB System members are also authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve “discount window,” but FRB regulations require institutions to exhaust all FHLB sources before borrowing from a Federal Reserve Bank.
Privacy Protection
Carver Federal is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of federal law.  These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “nonpublic personal information” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.  The regulations also require the Bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices.  In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
The Bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information.  These regulations implement certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as amended ("GLB").  The guidelines describe the agencies' expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities.  The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.  The Bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines.
Holding Company Regulation
The Company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the FRB. As such, the Company is registered with and subject to FRB examination and supervision, as well as certain reporting requirements. The FRB has enforcement authority 
 23

over the Company and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution. 
GLB restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies. Unitary savings and loan holding companies that are “grandfathered,” i.e., unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the regulator on or before May 4, 1999, such as the Company, retain their authority under the prior law. All other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for financial holding companies and certain other activities specified by FRB regulations. GLB also prohibits nonfinancial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies.
Restrictions Applicable to All Savings and Loan Holding Companies.  Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, from acquiring:

(1) | control (as defined under the Home Owners' Loan Act ("HOLA") of 1933, as amended), of another savings institution (or a holding company parent) without prior FRB approval;


(2) | through merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets, another savings institution or a holding company thereof, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or a holding company), without prior FRB approval; or


(3) | control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC.

A savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located, except:

(1) | in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the FDIC;


(2) | if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of March 5, 1987; or


(3) | if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association.

In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the FRB must consider issues such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the FRB to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository institutions. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust-preferred securities, which were previously includable within Tier 1 capital by bank holding companies within certain limits, are no longer be includable as Tier 1 capital, subject to certain grandfathering. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. However, pursuant to subsequent legislation, the FRB extended the applicability of the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception of its consolidated capital requirements to savings and loan holding companies and increased the threshold for the exception to $1.0 billion, effective May 15, 2015. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets are not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the FRB. Additional subsequent legislation directed the Federal Reserve Board to expand the applicability of the exception to holding companies up to $3.0 billion in consolidated assets; that change was effective in August 2018. 
The Dodd-Frank Act extends the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The FRB promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy 
 24

provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends’ previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
Federal Securities Laws
 The Company is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, tender offer, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Delaware Corporation Law
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Thus, it is subject to regulation by the State of Delaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
Federal Taxation
General. The Company and the Bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns, report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending March 31st, using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including in particular the Bank's tax reserve for bad debts. The bank has a subsidiary which files a REIT tax return which reports its income for tax purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending December 31st. The REIT does not join in the consolidated return and it pays tax on its undistributed taxable income. The REIT has and intends to continue to distribute its taxable income and therefore not pay tax at the REIT level. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company.
Distributions. To the extent that the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to shareholders, such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the Bank's “base year reserve,” i.e., its reserve as of March 31, 1988, to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans, and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank's taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not constitute non-dividend distributions and, therefore, will not be included in the Bank's taxable income.
The amount of additional taxable income created from a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution.  Thus, approximately 1.2 times the non-dividend distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate.
In December 2017, "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" was signed into law. At March 31, 2018, the Company made a reasonable estimate and recorded a remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the new reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate.  The impact on the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowances was a reduction of $3.1 million, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance of the same amount.  The Company recorded a benefit of $0.3 million for alternative minimum tax credits which, under the new tax law, are refundable.  As of March 31, 2019, the valuation allowance was reduced by $170 thousand, the amount of the AMT credits. 

 25

State and Local Taxation
State of New York.  The Bank and the Company (including the REIT) file tax returns on a combined basis and are subject to New York State franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases, whichever results in the highest tax.  “Entire net income” means federal taxable income with adjustments.  If, however, the application of an alternative tax (based on taxable net assets allocated to New York or a fixed minimum fee) results in a greater tax, the alternative tax will be imposed.  The Company was subject to tax based upon capital for New York State for fiscal 2019. In addition, New York State imposes a tax surcharge of 28% of the New York State Franchise Tax allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. For fiscal 2019, the New York State franchise tax rate computed on capital was 0.075%.  
On March 31, 2014, New York State tax legislation was signed into law in connection with the approval of the New York State 2014-2015 budget. Portions of the new legislation resulted in significant changes in the calculation of income taxes imposed on banks and thrifts operating in New York State, including changes to (1) future period New York State tax rates, (2) rules related to sourcing of revenue for New York State tax purposes and (3) the New York State taxation of entities within one corporate structure, among other provisions. In recent years, the Company has been subject to taxation based upon assets in New York State. The new legislation revised that method to a measurement based on net assets. 
New York City.  The Bank and the Company (including the REIT) file on a combined basis and are also subject to a similarly calculated New York City banking corporation tax on assets allocated to New York City.  For fiscal 2019, the New York City banking corporation tax rate computed on capital is 0.15%. On April 13, 2015, New York State legislation was signed changing the New York City tax law to conform to the New York State law that was adopted in 2014, with some minor differences. 
As a result of the impact of the 2014 legislation effecting both the New York State and New York City tax law, there was a decrease to the Company's gross deferred tax asset of $1.2 million in fiscal 2015 with no impact to current income due to the full valuation allowance.
Delaware Taxation.  As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
