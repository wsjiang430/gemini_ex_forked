ITEM 1: BUSINESS
  General
  Red Metal Resources Ltd. was incorporated in Nevada on January 10, 2005, as Red Lake Exploration, Inc. We changed our name to Red Metal Resources Ltd. on August 27, 2008.  On August 21, 2007, we formed Minera Polymet Limitada (Polymet), a limited liability company, under the laws of the Republic of Chile. On September 28, 2015 we changed Polymets incorporation from Limited Liability Company to a Closed Stock Corporation (SpA). We own 99% of Polymet, which holds our Chilean mineral property interests. To comply with Chilean legal requirements, 1% of Polymet is owned by a Chilean resident, an experienced manager who has organized an office and other resources for us to use. Polymets office is located in Vallenar, III Region of Atacama, Chile. When we refer to Red Metal, the Company, we, us or our in this report, we mean Red Metal Resources Ltd. together with Minera Polymet SpA.  2     Our resident agents office is at 711 S. Carson Street, Suite 4, Carson City, Nevada, 89701. Our business office is at 278 Bay Street, Suite 102, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 1R8. Our telephone number is (807) 345-7384; our email address is admin@redmetalresources.com; and our web address is www.redmetalresources.com. Information on our web site is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are a start-up mineral exploration company with no material revenue generating operations. We are in the business of acquiring and exploring mineral claims. All of our claims are located in the III Region of Atacama, Chile. To date we have not determined whether our claims contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable and have not produced revenues from our principal business.  Our ability to realize a return on our investment in mineral claims depends upon whether we maintain the legal ownership of the claims. Title to mineral claims involves risks inherent in the process of determining the validity of claims and the ambiguous transfer history characteristic of many mineral claims. To the best of our knowledge, and after consultation with an attorney knowledgeable in the practice of mining, we believe that we have taken the steps necessary to ensure that we have good title to our mineral claims. We have had our contracts and deeds notarized, recorded in the registry of mines and published in the mining bulletin; we review the mining bulletin regularly to determine whether other parties have staked claims over our ground. We have discovered no such claims.  Chiles mining and land tenure policies
  Chiles mining and land tenure policies were established to secure the property rights of both domestic and foreign investors to stimulate development of mining in Chile. The government of Chile owns all mineral resources, but exploration and exploitation of these resources are permitted through exploration and mining concessions. A mineral concession must pass through three stages to become a permanent mining concession, namely, pedimento, manifestacion and mensura.  A pedimento is an initial exploration claim. It can be placed on any area, whereas the survey to establish a permanent mensura claim can only be completed on free areas where no other mensuras exist. A pedimento is valid for a maximum of two years. At the end of this period it may either be reduced in size by at least 50% and renewed for an additional two years or entered into the manifestacion process to establish a permanent mensura claim. New pedimentos can overlap existing pedimentos, but the pedimento with the earliest filing date takes precedence providing the claim holder maintains the pedimento in accordance with the mining code and the applicable regulations.  Manifestacion, or mensura in process, is the process by which a pedimento is converted to a permanent mining claim. At any stage during its two-year life, the holder of a pedimento can submit a manifestacion application, which is valid for 220 days. To begin the manifestacion process, the owner must request a survey (mensura) within 220 days. After the survey request is accepted, the owner has approximately 12 months to have the claim surveyed by a government-licensed surveyor, inspected and approved by the national mining service, and affirmed as a mensura (equivalent to a patented claim) by a judge. Thereafter, an abstract describing the claim is published in Chiles official mining bulletin (published weekly) and 30 days later the claim is inscribed in the appropriate mining registry.  A mensura is a permanent property right that does not expire so long as the annual fees (patentes) are paid in a timely manner. Failure to pay the patentes for an extended period can result in the claim being listed for sale at auction, where a third party can acquire a claim for the payment of the back taxes owed and a penalty.  As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, our Chilean mineral properties include mensura and mensura in process claims.  Strategic relationships
  We have a close working relationship with Minera Farellon Limitada (Minera Farellon), a Chilean company owned equally by Kevin Mitchell, Polymets 1% shareholder and our former legal representative in Chile, and Richard Jeffs, who holds more than 5% of our shares of common stock (see Table 20). Minera Farellon investigates potential claims and often ties them up, by staking new claims, optioning or buying others claims, all at its own cost. This gives us an opportunity to review the claims prior to making a decision whether they are of interest to us.  3     If we are interested, then we either proceed to acquire an interest in the property directly from the owner, or, if Minera Farellon has already obtained an interest, we take an option to acquire its interest. Minera Farellon, located in the city of Vallenar, also provides some of our logistical support in Vallenar, which enables us to limit our operating expenses to those needed from time to time.  Unproved mineral properties
  Due to a lack of operating capital, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, we conducted no material exploratory operations on any of our properties. Until we are able to raise operating capital, which we cannot assure that we can do, we will not be able to initiate new exploration efforts or continue the exploration efforts we have begun. In the past we entered into several various agreements, being the joint ventures or the option agreements to acquire an interest in our claims. These agreements give us confidence there are opportunities to raise funds by selling some of our properties or by entering into joint venture agreements to continue developing some of our properties.  As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have three active properties which we have assembled since the beginning of 2007 - the Farellon, Mateo and Perth. In addition to our active properties, as an exploration company, from time to time we may stake, purchase or option claims to allow ourselves the time and access to fully consider the geological potential of the claims. This allows us to generate new properties in areas that have not been explored.  Active properties

 Figure 2: Farellon Property  FARELLON ALTO 1 - 8 CLAIM  The Farellon Alto 1 - 8 (the Farellon Claim) is the first mineral claim that we acquired in Chile. It covers 66 hectares and is centered about 309,150 east and 6,888,800 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 in Province of Huasco, Commune of Huasco, III Region of Atacama, Chile.  We acquired the claim on April 25, 2008, for $550,000 and owe a royalty equal to 1.5% of the net proceeds that we receive from the processor to a maximum of $600,000 with a monthly minimum of $1,000 when we start exploiting the minerals extracted from the claim (the Original Royalty). We can pay any unpaid balance of the royalty at any time.  On May 23, 2013, we entered into a rental agreement with Minera Farellon Limitada (Minera Farellon), to allow Minera Farellon to conduct certain exploration and mining activities on the Farellon Claim in exchange for a 10% royalty on gross smelter returns. This agreement was amended on June 5, 2014, when Polymet gave the permission to conduct certain exploration and mining activities on Farellon Alto 1 - 6 claims directly to Kevin Mitchell, leaving Minera Farellon the right to work on Farellon Alto 7 - 8 claims. And on October 21, 2014, the agreement was further amended to transfer the right to mine Farellon Alto 7 - 8 claims from Minera Farellon to Kevin Mitchell. In addition, the Company decreased the royalty on gross smelter returns payable by Mr. Mitchell from initial 10% to 5%. The 10% royalty was reinstated as of June 2015.  On December 9, 2013, in anticipation of exploration and mining activities carried out by Mr. Mitchell and Minera Farellon, we amended our option agreement with the vendor of Farellon Alto 1 - 8 Claim to allow us to carry out the exploration and mining activities without triggering the requirement to start paying the Original Royalty. The Amended Agreement allows us to work on the Farellon Claim, while paying the Vendor 5% royalty on net smelter returns maintaining a monthly minimum of $1,000 (the Amended Royalty); however, we can stop the exploration of the Farellon Claim at any time, which will cease our requirement to continue paying the Amended Royalty.  6     During the first quarter of our fiscal 2018, Mr. Mitchell stopped all mining operations on Farellon Alto 1-8 Claim. This stopped our recurrent royalty income from this source; however, at the same time it resulted in no royalty obligations to original vendor of the Farellon Alto 1 - 8 Claim.  CECIL 1 - 49 CLAIM  On September 17, 2008, we bought the Cecil 1 - 49, Cecil 1 - 40 and Burghley 1 - 60 claims for $27,676. On December 1, 2009, we initiated the manifestacion process when we applied to convert the Cecil 1 - 40 and Burghley 1 - 60 exploration (pedimento) claims to mining (mensura) claims. In January 2013 we abandoned the manifestacion process for the Cecil 1-40 and Burghley 1-60 claims due to the fact that several mensuras underlying the claims covered the most prospective ground as outlined in our prospecting and mapping program completed in April 2012.  The Cecil 1 - 49 (the Cecil Claim) covers 228 hectares and is centered at 310,250 east and 6,891,500 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 and lies approximately 1.7 kilometers north of the Farellon Claim border. The Cecil Claim covers a 700 metre strike length of a mineralized vein interpreted to be part of the same mineralizing system as the Farellon Alto 1 - 8 vein (the Farellon Vein). An investigation completed during the Farellon Claim acquisition uncovered a broad regional reconnaissance sampling program completed in 1996 showing results from the areas covered by the Cecil Claim. Results from the 1996 sampling show copper and gold grades similar to grades returned from the Farellon Vein, indicating that the Cecil Claim could have similar mineralized bodies.  During the year ended January 31, 2016, we fully impaired the Cecil 1 - 49 claim due to a lack of financial resources that would allow for substantive expenditures on further exploration and evaluation of the mineral resources within the Cecil Claim. We intend to maintain our right to the Cecil Claim and will resume the exploration activities once funding is available.  QUINA 1 - 56 CLAIM  On December 15, 2014, we entered into an option agreement with David Marcus Mitchell to earn 100% interest in the Quina 1-56 clam (the Quina Claim). The Quina Claim covers 251 hectares and is centered at 310,063 east and 6,890,435 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 and is contiguous to the Farellon Property. Acquisition of the Quina Claim added approximately 2 kilometers of strike length of the Farellon Veins.  In order to acquire the 100% interest in the Quina Claim, we were required to pay a total of $150,000, which we were able to pay in a combination of shares of our common stock and cash over four years, as detailed in the following schedule:  
Date | Option Payment
Upon execution of the Option Agreement (Execution date) (paid) | $ | 25,000 
12 months subsequent to the Execution date (paid) | | 25,000 
24 months subsequent to the Execution date (paid) | | 25,000 
36 months subsequent to the Execution date (paid) | | 25,000 
48 months subsequent to the Execution date (paid) | | 50,000 
Total | $ | 150,000


On December 9, 2018, we made our final cash payment of $50,000 to acquire 100% interest in Quina Claim. The vendor retains a 1.5% royalty from net smelter returns (NSR) on the Quina Claim, which we have the right to buy out for a one-time payment of $1,500,000.

EXETER 1-54 CLAIM

On June 3, 2015, we entered into an option agreement, made effective on June 15, 2015, with Minera Stamford S.A., to earn 100% interest in a mining claim Exeter 1-54 (the Exeter claim). The Exeter claim totals 235 hectares and is contiguous to our Farellon Property, which is located in the Carrizal Alto mining district, located approximately 75 kilometers northwest of the city of Vallenar, 150 kilometers south of Copiapo and 20 kilometers west of the Pan American Highway.

In order to acquire 100% interest in the Exeter claim, we were required to pay a total of $150,000 as detailed in the following schedule:


 | Option Payment
Upon execution of the Option Agreement (paid) | $ | 25,000 
On or before May 12, 2016 (paid) | | 25,000 
On or before May 12, 2017 (paid) | | 25,000 
On or before May 12, 2018 (paid) | | 25,000 
On or before May 12, 2019 (paid) | | 50,000 
Total | $ | 150,000


On May 13, 2019, we made our final cash payment of $50,000 to acquire 100% interest in Exeter Claim. The vendor retains a 1.5% royalty from net smelter returns (NSR) on the Exeter claim, which we have the right to buy out for a one-time payment of $750,000. 

OTHER CLAIMS

On August 21, 2012, we acquired four mineral claims - Azucar 6-25, Kahuna 1-40, Stamford 61-101, and Teresita - through the government auction for a total price of $19,784. The Azucar claim is the most prospective of these claims as it covers a 1,200 metre strike length of a mineralized vein interpreted to be part of the same mineralizing system as the Farellon Vein. Three parallel veins have also been identified on the Azucar claim during the 2012 mapping and prospecting program and can be seen on Figure 3.

Location and means of access

The Farellon property is approximately 40 kilometers west of the Pan-American Highway, about 1 hour and 15 minutes by vehicle from the town of Vallenar which has a population of 40,000 and modern facilities. High-tension power lines and a fiber-optic communications line run along the highway and both power and rail are connected to the Cerro Colorado iron ore mine only 20 kilometers from the Farellon property. The area is serviced from Copiapó, a city of 70,000 with daily air and bus services to Santiago and other centers.

The Farellon property can be accessed by driving approximately 20 kilometers north on the Pan-American Highway from Vallenar then turning northwest towards Canto del Agua. From Canto del Agua, the Farellon property is approximately 10 kilometers along a well-maintained gravel road. There are numerous gravel roads in the area, so a guide is necessary to access the property the first time. All of the roads are well maintained and can support large machinery necessary to transport drills, backhoes and bulldozers. Water is readily available in Canto del Agua and could probably be found on the Farellon property where all of the historic drill holes intersected water.

Exploration history

The Farellon property is in the Carrizal Alto mining district and lies 5 kilometers along strike south of the center of the historic Carrizal Alto copper-gold mine. Veins of the Farellon property were exploited as part of the Carrizal Alto mines. We have located no hard data summarizing all of the past mining activity, but tailings, slag dumps and the size of the shafts and some of the shallow surface workings are evidence of extensive historical mining.

Mine workings of various sizes are all along the Farellon property, but only one modern exploration program has been completed. In 1996, the Farellon and two other veins, the Fortuna and the Theresa, were explored by an Australian junior mining company Minera Stamford S.A. Their exploration included a large mapping and surface sampling program followed by a 34-hole RC drilling program. Of these 34 drill holes, 23 were drilled on the Farellon Alto 1 - 8 claim. The RC drilling program on the Farellon claim consistently intersected oxide and sulphide facies mineralization along a 2 kilometer-long zone covering the Farellon claim and strike extents to the south. Mineralization is 2 to 35 meters wide with an average width of 5 meters. The mineralized zone consists of one or more discrete veins and, in places, stockwork veining and mineralization. While drilling covered the length of the property, gaps up to 350 meters are untested and infill drilling is required to confirm an economic ore body.

Geology

The Farellon area has two major lithological units: Paleozoic metamorphic sediments consisting of schists, phyllites and quartzites; and the Franja Central diorites. The metamorphosed sediments outcrop in the western part of the property and have been metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies and then extensively overprinted by hydrothermal alteration. Hydrothermal alteration is directly associated with the shear zone. The diorite underlies the eastern part of the project area and has been extensively intruded by northeasterly trending intermediate mafic dykes. At the Farellon property, a small stock-like felsic body named Pan de Azucar intrudes the diorite. The intrusive relationship between the diorite and metamorphic sediments always appear to be tectonic. Within the property and at the main Carrizal Alto workings to the north, the major mineralization is intimately related to the south-southwest trending mylonitic sheared contact between the metamorphic sediments and the diorite. The shear is considered a splay of the main Atacama Fault Zone and dips 30º to 65º west. This contact parallels the regional geological trend and coincides with a major lineament which extends for hundreds of kilometers. The sheared contact is 50 meters to 200 meters wide over the 1.7-kilometre strike length of the Farellon property. Veins are typically 3 to 15 meters wide, striking south-southwest and dipping approximately 65 degrees to the northwest.
Mineralization

The Farellon property lies within the Candelaria iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) belt of Chile. Ore bodies in the belt occur in veins, breccias, stringer bodies and layer parallel replacement bodies and are typically associated with north-south trending faults related to the Atacama Fault Zone. All IOCG deposits have a strong association with iron oxides in the form of hematite or magnetite. In the Candelaria region, larger ore bodies are located where the fault zones intersect a lithological contact with significant rheological contrast such as a sedimentary and volcanic intrusive contact.

Economic IOCG deposits are generally polymetallic and can include iron, copper, gold, zinc, lead, uranium and cobalt among others. The Farellon property historically has been exploited for copper and to a lesser extent, gold. Cobalt mineralization was observed during the 1996-97 exploration work, but we have found no records of cobalt extraction.

Exploration Activities

Drilling (Summer 2011). During June through September 2011 we conducted a combined RC/diamond drill program on the Farellon property. The program was designed to continue to expand on the results of the 2009 drill program, as well as to continue confirming historical results along the strike. During this program we completed 11 drillholes for a total of 2,233m with the goal not only of better defining structural controls on mineralization but to examine the continuity of mineralization along strike and at depth. The target of the program was to outline a 700m mineralized strike length down to 200m vertical depth with approximate 75m intercept spacing, and to infill gaps 300m further to the north to increase intercepts to 150m spacing.

Many of the existing intercepts in this area were from the 1996/97 drill program, but no geological information can be located for these drill holes. By infilling the area with drilling at 75 meter pierce points the aim was to increase confidence in the continuity and increase knowledge of the nature and structural controls on mineralization to aid further exploration planning. 2011 drill results confirmed that mineralization is still present downdip of past drilling intercepts and still open at depth. Infill drilling continued to confirm the continuity of the mineralization and aided in the development of a 3D model that will be used for any future drill planning.

2011 drilling confirmed the overall regional shear structural controls on mineralization occurring within the oblique fault contact between overlying Paleozoic Metasediments and underlying Jurassic intermediate intrusives. Supergene mineralization seems to occur within local faults not immediately within the lithological fault contact - possibly fault splays emanating off the main regional structure. In the 2011 drillholes, supergene copper-gold mineralization was intersected 50-150m downhole with abundant carbonate and iron oxide precipitation.

Hypogene mineralization occurred below 150m hosted in quartz and carbonate veins which appear closer to the main shear fault zone contact. Approximately within 20m downhole of intersected hypogene mineralized veins the lithological contact was encountered, passing through to the underlying intrusive package. The 2011 drill program was generally positive in better defining structural controls on mineralization and proving continuity of mineralization along strike and at depth. However, more drilling is needed to continue to expand on the mineralized zone along strike and at depth, and prove up infill targets for initial resource estimation.

In spring of 2012 we commissioned Micon to complete a second 43-101 technical report. Micon now recommends that we conduct a much larger phase of exploration consisting of 5,000 meters of diamond drilling and 10,000 meters of RC drilling, and geophysical surveys and geological mapping. A geophysics survey using both magnetics and induced polarization will help to identify further mineralized structures on the property that may not have been noticed in the historic mapping. A phase two drill program would be at defined spacing to outline the continuity of mineralization leading to initial resource estimation. The depth of the drilling would be dependent on the results of the phase one drilling program. The estimated cost of this phase is $1.9 million.

Significant results of assays from the 2011 drill program are presented in Table 5 below.

 Figure 3: Farellon Property Geology  QA/QC, sampling procedures and analytical methods. Samples were taken at intervals between 0.5 and 2 metres. Sampling started at the collar of the hole and proceeded to the toe or bottom of the drill hole. Samples were taken at two metre intervals outside the previously identified main zone of interest. Through the main zone of interest samples were taken at one metre intervals. Generally, the sample recovery was good to excellent for the 2011 drilling program. Table 5 above summarizes significant assay results. They are reported as drill lengths as we have not established the width of the mineralized zone.  Our quality assurance, quality control (QA/QC) protocol consists of the addition of standards, blanks and laboratory duplicates to the sample stream. We inserted these into the sample series using the same number sequence as the samples themselves. One of the QA/QC check samples is inserted every 25 samples and it alternates between standards, blanks and laboratory duplicates.  Spring 2012 mapping program: In April of 2012 we completed a detailed mapping, prospecting and rock sampling program over the Farellon Property. This program was designed to extend the known mineralized zone to the north and the south and to identify the best potential to expand on the known mineralized zone. As a result of the mapping program, new ground was acquired at public auction in August 2012 to cover the strike extent of the mineralized veins.  11     2013 Drilling. In 2013 we drilled two RC drillholes on the Farellon Property. The two new drillholes, FAR-13-001 and 002, totaling 116 metres, were drilled 25 metres along strike and are intended to aid in identifying the most prospective area on the site to initiate small scale production. The results from the FAR-13-002 drillhole returned 2.15% Cu over 7m with .28 g/t Au; the FAR-13-001 drillhole returned 0.70% Cu over six meters with 0.20 g/t Au and including 1.25% Cu and 0.34 g/t Au over 2 meters.  2014 - 2016 Small Scale Mining. In January 2014 Minera Farellon Limitada started small scale mining activities on the Farellon Claim which in summer 2014 was continued by Mr. Mitchell. The main target of the development was an area intersected in 2011 and 2013 drilling campaigns, more specifically intercepts in drill holes FAR-11-001 of 3.95% Cu and 0.53 g/t Au over 8 meters, FAR-13-002 of 2.15% Cu and 0.28 g/t Au over 7 meters and FAR-13-001 of 0.70% Cu and 0.20 g/t Au over 6 meters including 1.25% Cu and 0.34 g/t Au over 2 meters (see news releases dated Sept. 21, 2011 and Jan. 24, 2014).  During our Fiscal 2017 Mr. Mitchells mining activities reached down to seven levels and approximately 60 meters vertical depth to the sulphide zone of the mine. Copper, silver and gold were extracted in the development process and were sold to ENAMI (the Chilean national mining company). Since January 2015 and up to January 2017 approximately 1,813 tonnes of oxide ore were sold grading 1.56% Cu and a further 12,606 tonnes of sulphide or grading 1.82% Cu, 6.8g/t Ag and 0.22g/t Au. Mr. Mitchell terminated his mining activities in January 2018.  We did not have any mining or exploration activities on the Farellon Claim during our Fiscal 2019.   PERTH PROPERTY  On March 10, 2011, we purchased for $35,000 a group of 12 claims (the Perth Property) consisting of one constituted mensura claim, the Perth claim, and 11 claims being converted to mensura claims. During our Fiscal 2017, we were notified that the surveying contractor originally hired to complete the work converting our Perth exploration claims into mining claims failed to complete the work in the time allotted. To correct the oversight, we have engaged services of a new surveying contractor who was able to complete the work on two claims, Lancelot I 1-27 and Rey Arturo 1-29, which are now awaiting confirmation from the Chilean government surveyor, and recommended starting the process over on the remaining claims. New exploration claims have been registered and we will make a decision on when to begin the process of converting these exploration claims into mining claims over the next two years, as permitted by Mining Code of Chile. See Figure 4 for details.  Table 6 describes the current Perth claims and Figure 4 illustrates them.  Table 6: Perth property

 Figure 4. The Perth Property  The Perth property is adjacent to the west side of the historic Carrizal Alto mine and lies approximately 3.5 kilometers north of our Farellon project. It is a 45 minute drive from Vallenar city, with major road access, power and water supply close by. The Perth property lies on a similar geologic contact as the Farellon and Carrizal Alto properties.  Location and means of access
  The Perth property is centered about 308,750 east and 6,895,000 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 approximately 75 km northwest of the city of Vallenar with the highest point at approximately 925 meters above sea level. The property is accessible by road from Vallenar. The Perth property is accessed by taking the Pan American Highway north from Vallenar for 20 kilometres, then turning northwest onto the road to Canto del Agua, a distance of 35 kilometres, then taking the Cardones Canyon road for 15 kilometres, and turning southwest towards Cerro Cachina Grande along a secondary gravel road for 14 kilometres to the property.  Exploration history
  Exploration programs on the Perth property have historically been limited to surface sampling and mapping programs completed in 2007 and 2008. Significant results from historic channel samples across the veins are shown in Table 7. Numerous artisanal mine workings on the property have previously been exploited for both copper and gold; however, no records of grade or tonnage can be located.  13     Table 7: Perth historic significant intersections

Geology

The Perth property overlies the contact between Paleozoic metamorphic sediments and a Cretaceous tonalitic batholith. A swarm of north northeast trending fault-related copper gold bearing quartz veins crosscuts the property. Surface mapping and sampling records show twelve veins identified so far on the south end of the property. The veins average two metres wide but have been measured up to six metres wide.

In spring 2011 we completed a reconnaissance mapping and sampling program on the Perth property. Geological mapping during the program identified four major areas where mineralization in veins appears to be concentrated. Sampling consisted of 129 reconnaissance samples taken of vein material where veins outcropped at surface. Significant results are summarized below:

During 2013 - 2014 Geoactiva SpA (Geoactiva), who we granted an option to purchase 100% of the Perth property, which was cancelled in August 2014, conducted a drilling program on the Perth property and surrounding claims. The drilling program totaled 3,965 meters, of which 4 drillholes were drilled primarily on Perth property. A total of 35 surface reconnaissance samples and 728 surface chip samples were taken from the Perth property.

MATEO PROPERTY

The Mateo property consists of fourteen contiguous claims, as described in Table 10. The Mateo claims overlap the Che, Margarita and Irene claims to secure the areas around the claims. Some of them may overlap others prior claims. We will acquire rights to these overlapped prior claims only if the owners forfeit their rights, and if we want the property. We acquired all of these claims for the same geological reasons and consider them one property, which we call the Mateo property.

During the year ended January 31, 2016, we fully impaired our Mateo Property due to a lack of financial resources that would allow for substantive expenditures on further exploration and evaluation of the mineral resources within the claims that comprise the Mateo Property. We intend to maintain the rights to the impaired claims and will resume the exploration activities once funding is available.

 (a) Some claims overlap others, reducing our net area to 1,184 hectares.

CHE UNO AND CHE DOS CLAIMS

On October 10, 2008, Minera Farellon Limitada granted us the option to purchase the Che Uno and Che Dos claims. The Che claims cover 76 hectares centered about 339,002 east and 6,838,450 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19. They are in the northwest corner of the Mateo property. On April 12, 2011 we completed the acquisition of the Che claims by paying approximately $20,000 to Minera Farellon.

16

We continue to owe a royalty equal to 1% of the net proceeds that we receive from the processor to a maximum of $100,000 with no monthly minimum when we start exploiting the minerals we extract from the claim. We have not yet exploited the claim.

MARGARITA CLAIM

We bought the Margarita mining claim on November 27, 2008, through a public auction for a total of $15,984. The Margarita claim covers 56 hectares centered around 340,353 east and 6,838,347 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 located within the northeast corner of the Mateo claim.
IRENE UNO AND IRENE DOS CLAIMS

On September 7, 2010, we entered into a purchase agreement with Minera Farellon to buy the Irene Uno and Irene Dos mining claims. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, we paid $45,174 (equivalent of 21 million Chilean pesos) on May 10, 2011 to exercise the option and purchase the Irene claims. The Irene claims cover 60 hectares centered about 341,002 east and 6,838,101 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19, are located within the northeast corner of the Mateo property, and share their western border with the Margarita claim.
MATEO CLAIMS

The Mateo claims consist of seven mensura in process - Mateo 1 through 3, 10A, 10B, 12 and 13, and two mensuras - Mateo 4 and 5, covering 1,461 hectares, which we staked between November 2008 and November 2011. The claims are centered about 337,675 east and 6,837,600 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 and cover a five-kilometer strike length of intensely altered volcanics with significant massive sulphide mineralization.

During the year ended January 31, 2015, we wrote off four Mateo claims as the due diligence work conducted on the claims revealed several earlier mensura claims underlying Mateo 9A, 9B, 9C and 10C claims.

Location and means of access

The Mateo property is centered about 337,675 east and 6,837,600 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 approximately 10 kilometers east of Vallenar with the highest point at approximately 1,050 meters above sea level. A well-used road leads from the city of Vallenar and crosses through the middle of the west half of the properties and along the southern border of the east half of the properties. Many unmarked dirt roads in the area provide reliable access to most areas of Mateo.

Description

The Mateo property is a copper-gold-silver project that lies in the Candelaria IOCG belt in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera. The Mateo property has undergone limited modern exploration including surface and underground RC drilling and artisanal mining on three separate mine sites, the Irene, Margarita and Santa Theresa mines. We have reviewed all available records of work completed to date, including some records of the mining activity. Our interpretation of the work completed to date indicates the potential for an economic ore body in mineralized mantos and skarn-style mineralization associated with IOCG deposits.

Exploration history

Historical work includes several drill programs completed by different Chilean private and public companies. Records exist from eight drillholes completed in 1994 on the Irene mine and include two full reports written by ENAMI (the Chilean national mining company) with interpretation of mineralization and recommendations for further exploration and mining work.

17

The Irene mine was investigated by ENAMI in 1994. Work completed during this time included surface RC drilling, including 490 meters in four RC drillholes, and underground diamond drilling, including 220 meters in four drillholes. We obtained ENAMIs reports of mining activities from 1994 through 1997. Approximately 11,875 tonnes of rock were mined in that time averaging 4.3% copper, 61.9 grams per tonne silver, and 1.01 grams per tonne gold. During the period from June 2009 to December 2010 the vendor of the Irene, Minera Farellon, conducted small scale mining activities on a different area of the Irene claims and mined 1,705 tonnes grading 1.39% Cu, 1.39g/t Ag, 0.29g/t Au in sulphides and 1,477 tonnes grading 1.98% Cu in oxides. The difference in grade between the historic work and the recent work is not an indication that further high grade material will not be found on the Mateo property and further modeling and exploration work needs to be completed to determine the best place to drill.

A private Chilean company, Minera Taurus, drilled 16 RC holes on the east end of the Irene claim, but we have no record from this drilling. An unknown company built a portal 250 meters long and approximately three meters wide by three meters high. The portal leads to three mined-out chimneys connected to the surface providing ventilation channels. On a recent property visit with ENAMIs geologists, we found an extension of the mineralized zone at the base of the tunnel below showing the potential for mineral resources.

Geology

Geologically, the Mateo property is located within the brittle-ductile north-south-trending Atacama Fault System that is known to host many of the major deposits in the Candelaria IOCG belt. Known mineralization is hosted in an andesitic volcaniclastic sequence assigned to the Bandurrias Formation. Widespread iron oxide and potassic alteration indicates an IOCG mineralizing system further supported by significant amounts of economic grade mineralization.
Exploration Activities

Exploration (2011). During August through October 2011 we carried out an in-depth geological mapping and sampling program on the Mateo property. The Mateo property has very diverse mineralization styles through the property which includes mantos, veins, breccias and porphyries with significant gold and copper. A total of 138 reconnaissance samples were collected over the property. The highest assay values returned from reconnaissance samples were 21g/t Au and 10.3% Cu but more common values were between 1-3g/t Au and 1-3% Cu. Table 11 summarizes the significant assay results.

The detailed mapping identified nine significant mineralized zones where further work is recommended.

2011 Ground Magnetic Survey. During September 2011 we engaged Quantec International Project Services Ltd. to complete a ground magnetic survey on the Mateo Property. The ground magnetic survey consisted of 70 survey lines with an EW orientation, and two control lines with a NS orientation. The survey lines were separated by 100m, and data was collected at 10m intervals on all lines. A total of 218.49km of magnetic data was collected. The survey outlined areas of high and low magnetic response. Areas of high magnetic response indicated the presence of elevated levels of magnetic minerals such as magnetite, pyrotite and hematite whereas areas of low magnetic response may be caused by alteration processes such as magnetite destruction or may simply indicate rock types that never had magnetic minerals.

This ground magnetic survey demarcated the northern and western extent with a large, high magnetic anomaly with a southwest to northeast orientation. This magnetic high may correlate with the Jilguero Intermediate Intrusive formation which is only partially exposed on the property and underlies the Jurassic Punta Del Cobre volcanics, and mixed sedimentary sequence.

Two possible correlations with geology are drawn when looking at the magnetic geophysical response. Firstly, all artisanal mines, reconnaissance samples and documented surface mineralization are exposed on the Western edge of the magnetic high in an area where magnetic high-low gradients are greatest transitioning from high to low. Secondly, magnetic highs appear to persist away from the main magnetic high body in a NW direction. Although these persisting magnetic highs are only small stringers in appearance they possibly correlate to dominant NW trending faults on the property that are often mineralized. Visual correlations between magnetic high/low contrasts and geology seem strong enough to suggest further exploration including sampling and drilling along the steepest gradient of magnetic high/low drop-off.

 Competition
  The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.  Raw materials
  The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.  Dependence on major customers
  We have no customers. Our first customer likely will be ENAMI, which refines and smelts copper from the ore that it buys from Chiles small- and medium-scale miners. ENAMI is located in Vallenar. We could also sell our ore to the Dos Amigos heap leach facility located approximately fifty kilometers south of Vallenar in Domeyko.  Patents/Trademarks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements/Labor Contracts
  We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, and, other than the royalties that were discussed under the Unproved mineral properties section, no royalty agreements or labor contracts.  Government controls and regulations
  We are not required to obtain permits or submit operational plans in order to conduct exploration on our properties. The mining business, however, is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.  19     The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.  None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit. We must repair any damage done to the land during exploration. Some of our claims are within the boundaries of a national park. According to the Mining Code of Chile, we will have to get written authorization from the government to mine or complete any exploration work within the park boundaries. We submitted an application to the government in December 2011 to explore within the park boundaries. We received a response to our application requesting we complete an environmental study on the area we are applying to work in. As part of this study we will have to hire an environmental consultant to investigate if any significant archeological remains exist in the area we intend to work in. Mapping and prospecting work completed north of the park boundary on the Farellon property has shown potential to expand the mineralized zone to the north where exploitation would not fall within the park boundaries. The Company has decided to focus exploration north of the park boundary to determine the potential of the entire mineralized area to host an economic deposit before pursuing the application to work within the park boundary any further.  If our operations in Chile become profitable, any earnings that we remit abroad will be subject to Chilean withholding tax.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations at each of our mineral claims.  Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
  We have incurred no costs to date for compliance with environmental laws for our exploration programs on any of our claims.  Expenditures on research and development
  We have incurred no research or development costs since our inception on January 10, 2005.  Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
  Red Metal does not have any employees. Caitlin Jeffs, Michael Thompson, Joao (John) da Costa, Jeffrey Cocks, and Cody McFarlane, who are directors and officers, provide their services to the Company as independent consultants. Polymet retains the services of Kevin Mitchell and an administrative assistant, who are Polymets only employees, other services are provided by independent consultants. We contract for the services of geologists, prospectors and other consultants as we require them to conduct our exploration programs.
