Overview
 Aerpio is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular disease. Our lead product candidate, AKB-9778, a small molecule activator of the Tie2 pathway, is being developed for the treatment of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR, a disease characterized by progressive compromise of blood vessels in the back of the eye. The Tie2 receptor is expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells (cells that line the inside of blood vessels) and its activity is essential for regulating vascular stability and preventing blood vessel compromise associated with diabetes. We have completed a Phase 2a trial of AKB-9778 in 144 patients with diabetic eye disease. Based on the results from this trial, we believe AKB-9778 has the potential to slow down or possibly reverse the damage to blood vessels caused by diabetes. In contrast to marketed treatments for NPDR that are administered by a physician via intraocular injection, we intend to deliver AKB-9778 systemically by self-administered subcutaneous injection, similar to insulin. We believe this delivery method provides an opportunity to treat diabetic eye disease at an earlier stage and reduces the likelihood of developing vision-threatening complications. 
 In June 2017, we initiated a 48-week, double-masked, Phase 2b clinical trial, which we refer to as TIME-2b, in patients with NPDR who have not developed more serious complications such as diabetic macular edema, or DME or proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or PDR. The TIME-2b study is a double-masked, placebo-controlled multi-center trial that is currently on-going and has enrolled 167 patients randomized evenly to receive either AKB-9778 15 mg subcutaneously once daily, AKB-9778 15 mg subcutaneously twice daily or placebo for a 48-week treatment period. The primary endpoint of the TIME-2b study is the percentage of patients who improve by at least 2 steps in Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score, or DRSS, in the study eye. We expect to report top line results of this trial in March 2019.
 According to the World Health Organization’s Global Report of Diabetes as of 2014, there are an estimated 422 million individuals living with diabetes worldwide. An estimated 34.6% of these individuals, or 146 million people, have Diabetic Retinopathy, or DR, 6.81%, or 28 million, have DME and 6.96%, or 29.7 million, have PDR. The underlying problem in diabetic complications is damage to the blood vessels, commonly referred to as diabetic vasculopathy, which is caused by chronic hyperglycemia. This damage causes blood vessels to leak fluid and proteins into the surrounding tissue, leading to complications. In the eyes, this damage leads to DR which can progress to DME and/or PDR. In other parts of the body such as the kidney, the damage leads to diabetic nephropathy and in the lower extremities, the damage leads to non-healing foot ulcers, peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. These diabetic complications lead to life- and sight-threatening conditions including kidney dialysis, amputations and blindness that are costly to treat. Diabetic patients with complications are estimated to cost the health care system 3.5 times more than patients without complications. If approved, we believe that systemic treatment with AKB-9778 could have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for diabetics in the future and potentially address a major societal problem by lowering the cost of care associated generally with diabetes.
 Diabetic eye disease is one of the most common and debilitating complications of diabetes. Over time, diabetes damages blood vessels in the back of the eye. When this happens, a patient is said to have DR. Eventually, these damaged blood vessels can leak blood proteins and fluid into the central portion of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for high resolution central vision. The leakage of protein and fluid into the macula causes swelling, a condition called DME. The more progressive stages of DR, referred to as PDR, are characterized by the growth of abnormal new blood vessels. These new blood vessels can bleed into the eye and if left untreated can result in decreased visual acuity and eventual blindness. The likelihood of a person developing these sight-threatening complications increases as DR progresses.
 AKB-9778 is a small molecule activator of the Tie2 pathway that we believe helps to stabilize blood vessel walls and prevent vascular compromise in the eye, and based on pre-clinical models, potentially elsewhere in the body. Such vascular compromise in the eye may eventually lead to DME or PDR and, in many cases, to loss of vision or even blindness. We believe AKB-9778’s mechanism of action reduces vascular damage and restores vascular integrity. In contrast to current therapies for diabetic eye disease, which are all administered by a physician via repeated injections into the eye, AKB-9778 is being developed as a self-administered subcutaneous injection that allows for treatment of both eyes.

Compromise of the Tie2 function is also implicated in other vascular complications of diabetes. We believe systemic treatment with AKB-9778 may address some of the most debilitating of the complications, including diabetic nephropathy. If we are successful in developing and commercializing AKB-9778 for NPDR, we may conduct clinical trials to evaluate AKB-9778’s potential to reduce or delay the need for kidney dialysis. In post-hoc analysis of Aerpio’s TIME-2b clinical trial, there was a 21% reduction (geometric mean) in urine albumin-to-creatinine ration (UACR) from baseline in the AKB-9778 treatment arms, but an overall increase in UACR in the placebo arm.  The study suggests potential beneficial activity from Tie2 activation in diabetic kidney disease.
 In addition to diabetic vascular disease, existing preclinical and clinical evidence suggest the potential of AKB-9778 for reducing intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma, or POAG, and ocular hypertension. We plan to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in the second quarter of 2019 to evaluate AKB-9778, administered via topical eye drops, and, if we observe positive results, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 program for this indication.
 In June 2018, we licensed AKB-4924, a selective stabilizer of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, or HIF-1 alpha to Gossamer Bio, Inc. (“Gossamer”). AKB-4924, (now called GB004), is being developed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). HIF-1 alpha is involved in mucosal wound healing and the reduction of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. We have completed a single ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers for AKB-4924 and Gossamer is currently conducting a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, study and is responsible for all remaining development and commercial activities for GB004. 
 ARP-1536, our humanized monoclonal antibody directed at the same target as AKB-9778, is in preclinical development. We are evaluating development options for ARP-1536, including subcutaneous injection for the treatment of diabetic vascular complications and intravitreal injection for the treatment of advanced diabetic eye disease such as DME or PDR. 
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to become the leader in the development of Tie2-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of vascular disorders. We are taking the following critical steps to achieve this goal:

• | Advance the development of AKB-9778 for treatment of diabetic retinopathy
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In June 2017, we initiated a 48-week, double-masked, Phase 2b clinical trial, TIME-2b, in patients with DR who have not developed more serious complications such as DME or PDR. We expect to report top line data in March 2019.
  
• | If approved for treatment of DR, establish collaborations to commercialize AKB-9778 globally
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If approved, we intend to independently pursue the approval and commercialization of AKB-9778 for treatment of DR in the U.S. We believe that many health care providers, including general ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians have the potential to treat early diabetic eye disease with AKB-9778, and we plan on utilizing a multi-faceted strategy that will engage these various health care providers. Outside of the U.S., we intend to pursue the approval and commercialization of AKB-9778 for treatment of DR through strategic collaborations. We may develop and commercialize AKB-9778 for other indications independently or through collaborations with third parties.
  
• | Advance the development of AKB-9778 for primary open angle glaucoma
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 We plan to evaluate a topical formulation of AKB-9778 for POAG into a proof-of-concept Phase 1b study in the second quarter of 2019.  If we observe positive results from this study, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 program to evaluate AKB-9778 for POAG.
  
• | Investigate the potential of AKB-9778 in other indications
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 The downregulation of Tie2 activity occurs in the vasculature of diabetics systemically, particularly in the kidney. While we are initially focused on the development of AKB-9778 for treatment of DR, our ongoing Phase 2b trial includes exploratory endpoints to study the effects of AKB-9778 on diabetic kidney disease. If we observe positive signals in these exploratory endpoints, we will consider clinical development of AKB-9778 in diabetic nephropathy.

• | Advance the development of ARP-1536
--+------------------------------------

 We are evaluating development options for ARP-1536, including subcutaneous injection for the treatment of diabetic vascular complications and intravitreal injection for the treatment of advanced diabetic eye disease (DME/PDR).
  
• | Explore strategic collaborations with leading organizations for the development and commercialization of promising product candidates in our pipeline
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may explore strategic collaborations with leading biopharmaceutical companies and organizations to develop and commercialize product candidates in our pipeline. In June 2018, we licensed AKB-4924 to Gossamer for the development of this candidate for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. We may consider additional collaborations in the future to apply our technology to areas of unmet medical need.
 AKB-9778 for Diabetic Retinopathy 
 We believe that AKB-9778, if approved, has the potential to be a market leader for the treatment of early stage diabetic eye disease, DR that has not yet developed vision-threatening complications. There are currently approximately 146 million individuals globally with DR, and this number is projected to continue to grow over the next 30 years. AKB-9778 is designed to eliminate intraocular injections, reduce physician visit burden, simultaneously treat both eyes, of which an estimated 65-70% of diabetic eye disease patients have bilateral disease, reduce or slow progression to development of vision-threatening events, such as DME and PDR, and protect other vascular beds affected by diabetes.     
 We have completed a Phase 2a trial of AKB-9778 in 144 patients with DR complicated by DME. We observed the following results in this trial:
  
• | We observed promising signs of reduction in the severity of DR when AKB-9778 was used as monotherapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | These improvements in diabetic retinopathy severity were seen bilaterally, in the study and fellow eye.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AKB-9778 monotherapy had fewer ocular and non-ocular adverse events than either Lucentis (ranibizumab) monotherapy or combination therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema Overview
 DR is a frequent complication of diabetes and is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness among working-age individuals. Patients with DR have a progressive compromise of microvasculature which eventually manifests as leaky blood vessels that allow fluid and blood to leak into surrounding tissues. This leakage presents problems in areas of the body that are highly vascularized such as the retina and the kidney. Fluid leakage in the eye can distort vision directly and the loss of blood flow to other parts of the retina can result in local oxygen deprivation or hypoxia. This hypoxia then triggers the formation of new blood vessels; however, these new vessels are often not well-formed and leaky, leading to further deterioration of vision. In some cases, there is excessive accumulation of fluid or edema near the center of the retina or macula that has severe effects on vision. This accumulation is referred to as DME. This edema leads to thickening of the macula region of the retina and loss of visual acuity. The various features of DR vascular dysfunction are illustrated in the following graphic.
 
Figure 1: Progression of diabetic eye disease is characterized by worsening vascular compromise.

The severity of DR is evaluated using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, severity scale. This scale is divided into 11-discreet steps with less severe disease having lower step scores and more advanced disease having higher step scores. The natural history of DR in most patients is a progressive worsening that can be captured in photographs of the retina, shown below. In its initial stages, DR is characterized by vascular changes in the retina that are detectable by color photography of the back of the eye, or fundus. In these early stages, visual function can remain intact even in the presence of profound vascular compromise. The progression of DR severity is associated with increased risk for vision loss due to the growth of abnormal blood vessels, typical in DME and PDR.
 
Figure 2. Fundus photographs or a normal retina (left) and a retina with advanced DR (right).
 
Figure 3: Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale used to grade fundus images of the retina and measure the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy. 
 The majority of diabetic patients will eventually develop DR. By 20 years after disease diagnosis, nearly 100% of type 1 diabetics and 60% of type 2 diabetics will have developed DR. Among an estimated 19.8 million US adults forty years and older known to have diabetes (Types 1 and 2), prevalence rates for DR and DME were 23.7% (4.7 million) and 3.8% (746,000), respectively. We believe both DR and DME are likely to persist as public health problems due to both the aging of the global population and increasing prevalence of diabetes over time.
 Current Treatments for DR
 Laser photocoagulation is sometimes used to treat DR prior to the development of vision-threatening events. This treatment entails using a high-energy laser to destroy diseased retinal tissue and cauterize leaking blood vessels. While this therapy prevents further vision loss, it does not address the pathology of constant and prolonged vascular damage that happens in the diabetic retina and is therefore not considered a disease-modifying therapy. In addition 
 7


to destroying retinal tissue, laser photocoagulation can be associated with several adverse events including transient decreases in central vision, black spots in the center or around the center of a patient’s vision, delayed or impaired adaption of vision in dark settings, visual field defects or proliferation of abnormal blood vessels leading to macular edema.
 
Figure 4: Normal retina (left). Retina after panretinal laser photocoagulation (right).
 Lucentis is approved for the treatment of DR. This approval is based on the ability of monthly intraocular injections of Lucentis to improve underlying diabetic retinopathy by two or more steps on the ETDRS DRSS scale compared to placebo at the end of one year of treatment. Improved rates of 2-step improvement in DRSS has also recently been demonstrated 
with repeated Eylea intraocular injection compared to sham injection.  Based on these results, Regeneron has submitted a sBLA for the indication treatment of DR. However, Lucentis and Eylea require intraocular injections and frequent visits to the ophthalmologist which could create patient burden and discomfort. Furthermore, if the patient presents with bilateral disease (approximately 70% of DR patients have bilateral disease), the patient must undergo separate intraocular injections in each eye.
 If we are successful in developing and obtaining approval of AKB-9778 for the treatment of DR we believe that we can be market leaders in the space due to the potential advantages of AKB-9778, including the potential to eliminate intraocular injections, reduce physician visit burden, simultaneously treat both eyes, of which approximately 65-70% of diabetic eye disease patients have bilateral disease, reduce or slow progression to development of vision-threatening events, such as DME and PDR, and possibly protect other vascular beds affected by diabetes.

Role of Tie2 in Diabetic Disease
 Tie2 is a receptor that is normally activated in healthy blood vessels. When active, Tie2 is a key regulator of vascular stability and function. In its active state, Tie2 maintains blood vessel stability by several mechanisms, including tightening the junctions between the cells that line blood vessels, maintaining support cell coverage of blood vessels, and resisting growth signaling from proliferative cytokines. In diabetic patients, an upregulation of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase, or VE-PTP, an enzyme that inactivates Tie2, contributes to vascular destabilization. 

Figure 5. VE-PTP is upregulated in diabetic vasculature and leads to deactivation of the Tie2 receptor.
 Our Solution AKB-9778
 AKB-9778 works by inhibiting VE-PTP, an enzyme that is upregulated in diabetic eye disease and that is responsible for inactivating Tie2. AKB-9778 was developed using modern drug discovery techniques such as structure-based drug design to selectively target and inhibit VE-PTP at sub-nanomolar concentrations and has a high degree of selectivity. The potency and selectivity of AKB-9778 minimize the potential for off-target side effects. Inhibition of the inhibitor, VE-PTP, by AKB-9778 leads to activation of Tie2.
 
Figure 6. AKB-9778 binds to and inhibits the active site of VE-PTP, resulting in Tie2 activation.
 We believe that AKB-9778 may hold a competitive advantage versus other product candidates that are currently in development that target other aspects of the Tie2 pathway. We are aware that two other companies, Roche and Regeneron, are developing agents that inhibit Ang-2, a natural antagonist of Tie2. Ang-2 can bind to Tie2 and 
 9


prevent Ang-1 dependent activation. However, simply reducing the levels of Ang-2 has no effect on the activity of VE-PTP, which inactivates Tie2 further downstream of Ang-2 binding. 
 
Figure 7. Inhibiting VE-PTP with AKB-9778 robustly activates Tie2 in human endothelial cells in 
 pre-clinical experiments (Shen et al. JCI 124:4564-76, 2014).
 Clinical Results in DME
 We completed a double-masked Phase 2a trial of AKB-9778 in 144 patients with DR complicated by DME. In this trial 15 mg of AKB-9778 was administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily (BID) for three months either as monotherapy or in combination with intravitreal injections of Lucentis. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous AKB-9778 + sham intravitreal injections, subcutaneous AKB-9778 + Lucentis intravitreal injections, or subcutaneous placebo + Lucentis intravitreal injections. Only one eye, designated as the study eye, received the intravitreal injections. In addition to efficacy measures based on parameters related to DME, the efficacy of these agents on DR severity was also pre-defined. 
 Efficacy in DME was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the macula using a standard criterion called central subfield thickness, or CST. As edema, or fluid leak from blood vessels, increases, the macula layer becomes distended, and rather than having a normal thickness of less than 300 µm, the DME patients in this trial had an average CST (baseline) of approximately 500 µm. The retinal thickness was measured using optical coherence tomography or OCT, an imaging technology providing high resolution images showing changes in retinal thickness.
 In our completed Phase 2a study the cohort of patients treated with the combination of AKB-9778 and Lucentis showed a significantly greater reduction in macular edema (mean reduction = 164.4 µm) compared to that achieved by Lucentis monotherapy (mean reduction = 110.4 µm; with p=0.008, ANCOVA using baseline values as covariate). The mean CST at end of treatment was 340.0 µm with 29.2% of eyes achieving a CST less than 300 µm in the AKB-9778 combination group versus 392.1 µm with 17.0% of eyes achieving a CST less than 300 µm in the Lucentis monotherapy group. The improvement in CST when AKB-9778 was used in combination increased between the second and third months of treatment. Based on this pattern, we believe that longer treatments with the combination of AKB-9778 and Lucentis have the potential to further reduce CST. AKB-9778 monotherapy did not show efficacy in reducing macular edema. The long standing DME in the TIME-2 study, duration of DME roughly 5 years, is characterized by large vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF loads. Anti-VEGF therapy is required to reduce the VEGF load and the resultant permeability. In animal models, therapy with AKB-9778 activates the Tie2 receptor, which has been shown to reduce the endothelial response to VEGF and normalize vasculature, improve blood flow and oxygenation potentially leading to reduced VEGF production. These findings explain, in part, why combination therapy may produce greater clinical activity than anti-VEGF alone and provide a hypothesis as to why Tie2 therapy alone has minimal benefit as it relates to VEGF-driven vascular permeability. In earlier disease, where vascular compromise has not progressed far enough to stimulate a VEGF response, we believe AKB-9778 may be able to positively remodel vasculature and reverse early diabetic eye disease delaying or preventing the onset of DME and PDR.

Figure 8. Aggregate Data for Reduction in CST in Phase 2a trial in patients with DME.
 Clinical Results in DR
 The DR efficacy in the study eyes was assessed in 118 patients with study eyes having DRSS scores of less than seven, which represents mild to severe disease severity, a level of disease that we believe may be reversible. Because AKB-9778 was dosed systemically we were also able to assess the potential efficacy of AKB-9778 in both the study eye and fellow eyes with underlying DR. Of the 144 patients in this trial, 94 of them had DR in fellow eye, with a DRSS score of less than seven and had not received other treatments during the study treatment period. The severity of DR was assessed using the ETDRS grading of standard retinal photographs. Grading is based on an 11-point scale whose progression is measured through a series of discrete steps. These steps are referred to as the DRSS.
 Improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity in study eyes was similar across groups at three months with approximately 10% of patients in each group achieving a two or more-step improvement in DRSS. Importantly, in the study eye, AKB-9778 was associated with approximately the same response rate as Lucentis, which is approved for the treatment of DR. A key difference between these two agents is that Lucentis was administered by an injection into the eye by a clinician while AKB-9778 was administered by subcutaneous injection by the patient, which we believe may result in greater patient compliance due to ease of administration.
 The activity of AKB-9778 in the fellow eye was assessed using the same criteria. None of the fellow eyes received any intravitreal injections of Lucentis or sham. Out of the 94 patients with fellow eyes with previously untreated DR, 24 of them received subcutaneous placebo and 70 of them received subcutaneous AKB-9778. In the placebo group, 4.2% of fellow eyes showed 2 or more-step improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity score after three months of treatment, compared to 11.4% of fellow eyes in the AKB-9778 group. The systemic nature of this treatment approach allows AKB-9778 to reach the vasculature of both eyes, potentially treating both eyes with one treatment.
 11



Figure 9. Percent of patients with a 2 or more-step improvement in diabetic retinopathy from baseline to three months in the Phase 2a, TIME-2 trial.
 Because the likelihood of development of macular edema or proliferative diabetic retinopathy increases as DR severity increases, which is supported by other contemporaneous studies of diabetic eye disease, we believe improvement of underlying DR or prevention of its progression could reduce visual disability associated with diabetes. 
 Safety
 There was a total of fifteen severe adverse events in the three-month treatment period of the Phase 2a trial with four considered to be treatment-related. Three of these treatment-related events occurred in a single patient who was enrolled in the Lucentis monotherapy arm and who experienced two severe headaches and one migraine event. A second patient in the AKB-9778 combination therapy group reported a severe treatment-related hypoglycemia event.

Ongoing Phase 2b Clinical Trial in Diabetic Retinopathy
 In June 2017, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial called TIME-2b. TIME-2b is a double-masked, placebo-controlled multi-center trial that has enrolled 167 patients randomized evenly to receive either AKB-9778 15 mg subcutaneously once daily, AKB-9778 15 mg twice daily or placebo for 48-weeks. The primary endpoint of the TIME-2b study is the percentage of patients who improve by at least 2 steps in DRSS in the study eye. We expect to report topline data from this trial in March 2019.
 
Figure 10. Trial design for Phase 2b trial in DR with AKB-9778.
 Rationale for Selecting Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy as Development Indication 
 We have chosen to focus our development of AKB-9778 in NPDR for several reasons: 
  
• | Preliminary evidence of efficacy in Phase 2a setting that is similar to FDA-approved treatment (i.e. Lucentis)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consistent bilateral improvement in study and fellow eye
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of improvement in placebo-treated eyes without active therapeutic is consistent with results from control arm of contemporaneous diabetic retinopathy studies
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established regulatory path for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy by previous therapeutic approaches (i.e. Lucentis): proportion of patients achieving a two or more-step improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity score compared to placebo at one year
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient compliance and convenience benefit of subcutaneous method of administration compared to intra-vitreal injection: reduction of visit and treatment burden
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential ability to benefit disease in both eyes
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Potential ability to benefit other vascular beds
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunity to treat diabetic eye disease at an earlier stage
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | High unmet medical need and market potential
--+---------------------------------------------

 Treating patients earlier in the disease process, before the onset of vision-threatening pathology, represents a market opportunity with significant unmet need. Currently, no disease modifying therapy exists for earlier stage DR with the same convenience of AKB-9778. We believe systemic treatment with AKB-9778 has the potential to reverse or prevent vascular damage that is the hallmark of early diabetic eye disease potentially resulting in the delay or 
 13


prevention of development of advanced complications such as DME and PDR. Lucentis, the only approved therapy for DR, is administered by repeat injections into the eye, and patients with bilateral disease require separate injections in each eye. Furthermore, treatment with Lucentis requires monthly visits to the ophthalmologist.  Our internal market research indicates intraocular injections for DR are not favored by patients with early stage disease which is typically bilateral and minimally symptomatic.
 We believe AKB-9778 monotherapy provides a promising opportunity for the treatment of early stage DR. As a patient self-administered therapy, AKB-9778 could potentially reduce the burden of treatment and office visits associated with other treatments for diabetic eye disease. This is of importance given emerging evidence that even patients with more advanced disease whose vision is at risk from diabetic eye disease do not visit ophthalmologists and receive treatment on a regular basis. A treatment that does not require an office visit could potentially be a solution to this problem. A majority of patients with early DR will have bilateral disease with fairly well-preserved visual acuity. We believe these patients are more likely to accept a therapy based on subcutaneous injections, a delivery method that is already familiar to most diabetics, than an injection into the eye. The systemic nature of this treatment approach allows AKB-9778 to reach the vasculature of both eyes, treating bilateral disease.
 If approved by the FDA, AKB-9778 will, to our knowledge, be the only patient self-administered drug to treat non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with subcutaneous injections, a delivery method that, according to market research we have conducted, is preferred by patients compared to injections into the eye. In addition, AKB-9778 has the potential to decrease the need for the anti-VEGF drugs if it delays or prevents disease progression to DME and/or PDR, an effect we intend to investigate in post marketing studies.
 Prevalence studies estimate that roughly one in every three diabetics has underlying diabetic retinopathy while one in every fifteen diabetics has underlying DME. This translates into the DR market being roughly five times larger than the DME market.
 The approval of Lucentis for all forms of diabetic retinopathy and aflibercept for the treatment of DR in the setting of DME as well as the agreed upon special protocol assessment between Regeneron and the FDA on the Phase III PANORAMA study has established a regulatory path in DR. Our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial of AKB-9778 is powered to show a statistically significant difference between AKB-9778 and placebo in the proportion of patients improving by 2 or more-steps on the ETDRS diabetic retinopathy severity scale.
 Other Potential Systemic Indications
 Systemic therapy with AKB-9778 could also provide therapeutic benefits in other areas of the body affected by diabetes, including in the kidneys and other organ systems. Treatment that could affect vascular compromise in these tissues could potentially prevent or delay the need for more extreme interventions such as kidney dialysis or amputation. We have included exploratory endpoints in our on-going Phase 2b trial of AKB-9778 in early-stage DR to study the effects of AKB-9778 on parameters of diabetic kidney disease, including but not limited to urine albumin creatinine ratio. If approved for such indications, we believe that systemic treatment with AKB-9778 has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for diabetics and solve a major societal problem by lowering the cost of care associated with diabetic complications. This societal cost is significant as diabetic complications are estimated to cost the health care system 3.5 times more than patients without complications.AKB-9778 in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma 
 Unmet medical need:
 POAG is a leading cause of blindness affecting approximately 64.3 million people worldwide in 2013 with an expected increase to 76.0 million in 2020 and 118.0 million by 2040. POAG is characterized by optic nerve and neuroretina anomalies and progressive visual field defects. Elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, is the primary modifiable risk factor and reducing IOP is the only clinical approach shown to slow or prevent vision loss. Despite the availability of effective IOP lowering drugs, many patients require multiple agents to control IOP that together often fail to achieve target IOP. The conventional outflow pathway, consisting of the trabecular meshwork and a specialized vessel called Schlemm’s canal, controls IOP and has been identified as the site of increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow in POAG. Importantly, most current POAG therapies do not target conventional outflow, and reduce IOP by either decreasing the formation of aqueous humor or facilitating non-conventional outflow pathways. The failure of most current therapies to modify conventional outflow has been hypothesized to contribute to continued deterioration of conventional outflow and progressive increases in IOP over time. We believe that developing agents that target 
 14


conventional outflow pathology directly will likely have improved therapeutic potential alone or in combination with approved glaucoma agents and may prevent progression of POAG that often occurs despite current therapy.  
 Emerging role of the Tie2 Pathway in the maintenance of conventional outflow:
 Recently, two independent groups have shown that Tie2 is expressed and activated in Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells during development and in the mature vessel. Disruption of the Tie2 pathway in mice by conditional knockout early in postnatal development results in failure of the formation of Schlemm’s canal, associated with increased IOP and with retinal and optic nerve pathology resembling human congenital glaucoma. Tie2 pathway disruption later in postnatal development results in degeneration of Schlemm’s canal with development of increased IOP and retinal and optic pathology reminiscent of POAG. Tie2 is most highly expressed in mature Schlemm’s canal inner wall endothelium and disruption of the Tie2 pathway results in increased cell death, or apoptosis, and reduced formation of giant vacuoles consistent with compromised conventional outflow. Supporting these preclinical findings, Tie2 loss of function variants were identified in 10 of 189 unrelated primary congenital glaucoma families, and SNPs in the Ang-1 promoter region were significantly associated with the risk of POAG. We believe that these preclinical findings along with human genetic evidence provides a sound scientific premise that activation of the Tie2 pathway in Schlemm’s canal could provide a novel conventional outflow-targeted POAG therapy.
 Role of VE-PTP in Signaling Pathways and Relevance to Glaucoma
 Aerpio has developed first-in-class, potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of the catalytic domain of VE-PTP. In vascular endothelial cells, AKB-9778, Aerpio’s lead VE-PTP inhibitor, activates Tie2 and triggers signaling pathways downstream of Tie2 that have been implicated in modulation of conventional outflow facility. These include endothelial nitric oxide synthase, or eNOS, activation and Rho pathway inhibition via Rac1.
 
Figure 11. VE-PTP inhibition as a novel conventional outflow targeted approach for glaucoma treatment.
 Activation of Tie2, with AKB-9778, affects pathways commonly associated with reduction of intraocular pressure. Rhopressa and Vyzulta are recently approved glaucoma drugs which block the Rho pathway and stimulate the eNOS pathway, respectively. Inhibition of VE-PTP should provide both benefits, blocking Rho and stimulating eNOS.

Evidence Supporting Tie2 Activation as a Conventional Outflow Glaucoma Target:
 In a completed Phase 2a clinical trial, patients receiving subcutaneous AKB-9778 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline in IOP compared to those receiving subcutaneous placebo injections. These IOP reductions were detected in individuals with normal ocular pressure in a study not designed to measure IOP changes and were of the same magnitude as reductions seen in individuals with normal ocular pressure on oral β-blocker therapy. Moreover, patients with baseline IOP greater than or equal to 16 mmHg had larger reductions in IOP than those with baseline IOP less than 16 mmHg, consistent with effects on pressure dependent conventional outflow. 
 
Figure 12. Subcutaneous administration of AKB-9778 significantly reduces IOP in patients with normal ocular pressure.
 Preclinical Data Supporting Topical Ocular Delivery of AKB-9778:
 Based on preliminary clinical proof-of-concept by subcutaneous administration of AKB-9778, Aerpio is advancing a topical ocular program for AKB-9778 as a conventional outflow-targeted approach to the treatment of patients with POAG or ocular hypertension. AKB-9778 is soluble in aqueous solution and preliminary topical ocular studies in rabbits have demonstrated good tolerability, superior aqueous humor exposure and IOP lowering compared to subcutaneous administration. The AKB-9778 topical formulation was well tolerated, and exposure was demonstrated in the aqueous humor following two days of three times a day 30 μL topical ocular administration to both eyes of New Zealand White rabbits. These data suggest that a topical ocular formulation of AKB-9778 may be sufficient to deliver AKB-9778 to target ocular tissues with acceptable tolerability.
 16


The AKB-9778 topical ocular formulation was also well tolerated following seven days of once daily, or QD, and twice daily, or BID, 30 μL topical ocular administration to both eyes in New Zealand White Rabbits with normal ocular pressure and demonstrated a dose-dependent and statistically significant reduction in IOP of both QD and BID topical ocular dosing at the highest dose level, as shown in the figure below. Reduction in IOP persisted for at least 24 hours following the last dosing period and the treatment was well-tolerated with no visible irritation or hyperemia seen.
 
Figure 13.  IOP effects of topical ocular compared to subcutaneous AKB-9778 in male rabbits. High dose topical ocular (40 mg/ml) AKB-9778 administered either QD or BID reduced IOP more than low dose topical (15 mg/ml) or subcutaneous (10 mg/kg) administration BID (Day 7). IOP effects persisted 24 hours post dose (Day 8).  
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1b study to evaluate the potential of topical AKB-9778 to lower IOP in the first half of 2019, with top-line results expected to be available by the third quarter of 2019. 
 ARP-1536 
 ARP-1536 is a humanized monoclonal antibody currently in preclinical development that is directed at the same target as AKB-9778. ARP-1536 binds the extracellular domain of VE-PTP inhibiting its ability to interact with Tie2. Our preclinical development program has shown that inhibiting VE-PTP with an antibody results in an activity profile similar to AKB-9778 in a number of different models of retinopathy. We are evaluating development options for ARP-1536, including subcutaneous injection for the treatment of diabetic vascular complications and intravitreal injection for advanced diabetic eye disease, such as DME and PDR.
 AKB-4924 for Inflammatory Bowel Disease
 AKB-4924 (now called GB004), a selective stabilizer of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, or HIF-1 alpha, works by inhibiting HIF prolyl-hydroxylase enzymes. Unlike other compounds currently in development that act broadly against all forms of HIF, GB004 selectively stabilizes a specific form of HIF, HIF-1 alpha. HIF-1 alpha has an effect on innate immunity and epithelial barrier function. However, HIF-1alpha differs from HIF-2, in that it does not stimulate the formation of new red blood cells. We have tested GB004 in multiple preclinical models of IBD and also completed a Phase 1a single-ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers with orally administered GB004. Gossamer is currently conducting a multiple ascending dose, or MAD study. 
 License Agreement
In June 2018, we entered into a license agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gossamer under which we granted Gossamer an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize AKB-4924 and other structurally related products worldwide, with initial development expected in the indications of induction and maintenance in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease (“Gossamer License”). Gossamer is responsible for the further 
 17


development and commercialization of the licensed products, and a joint development committee has been formed to oversee the development and manufacturing activities related to the licensed products. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Gossamer paid an upfront payment to us of $20 million. We are also eligible to receive up to $55 million in development milestone payments, up to $85 million in commercial milestone payments, and up to $260 million in sales milestone payments, with such payments contingent on the achievement of specified milestones with respect to the first licensed product for each of the first two initial indications. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of licensed products at percentages ranging from a high-single-digit to mid-teens, subject to certain customary reductions. In addition, under certain circumstances, in lieu of receiving the foregoing milestone payments and royalties, we may elect to receive a specified percentage of payments received by Gossamer and its stockholders (with some exclusions) in connection with Gossamer’s grant of a sublicense or other rights to the licensed products or if Gossamer undergoes a change of control and the value of the transaction exceeds a certain value (provided that Gossamer can prevent us from exercising this option if the parent company of Gossamer is the entity undergoing the change of control). Conversely, we could be required to accept such a specified percentage of those payments, if Gossamer agrees to pay us a certain minimum upon Gossamer and its stockholders being paid. Such amount may be reduced if the subject transaction includes pharmaceutical candidates or products or other named asset categories in addition to the licensed products.
 The agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the later of fifteen years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. Gossamer may terminate the agreement in the event Gossamer determines there is a potential safety or efficacy issue with the licensed products. We may terminate the agreement if Gossamer institutes certain actions related to the licensed patents. Under certain termination circumstances, we would have worldwide rights to the terminated program.
 Intellectual Property
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned at least 28 U.S. patents, at least 21 pending U.S. provisional or non-provisional patent applications, at least 235 foreign patents and at least 111 pending foreign applications, with claims directed toward various aspects of our product candidates and research programs, not counting patents and patent applications that have been licensed to a third party. Specifically, the claims of these patents and patent applications include compositions of matter, methods of use, drug product formulations, and methods of manufacture. Such patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2027 to 2039, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. Within the foregoing patent portfolio, as of December 31, 2018, we owned at least 5 U.S. patents, at least 8 pending U.S. provisional or non-provisional patent applications, at least 37 foreign patents and at least 25 pending foreign applications that are directed toward ARP-1536 and formulations or uses thereof. As of December 31, 2018, within the foregoing patent portfolio, we owned at least 23 U.S. patents, at least 13 pending U.S. provisional or non-provisional patent applications, at least 199 foreign patents and at least 86 pending foreign applications that are directed toward AKB-9778 and formulations, medicinal chemistry variants or uses thereof. Such patents claiming compositions of matter directed toward ARP-1536 are set to expire in 2027, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. Such patents claiming compositions of matter directed toward AKB-9778 are set to expire in 2027, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. 
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 There are a number of currently marketed products and product candidates in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat the various diseases that we are targeting. If AKB-9778 and our other product candidates are approved for the indications that we are targeting, they will compete with the products and product candidates discussed below.
 18


DR—Lucentis was recently approved to treat patients with DR. In addition, laser photocoagulation is sometimes used to treat DR prior to the onset of DME and temporarily prevent further vision loss. The anti-VEGF agent, Eylea (aflibercept), which is injected into the eye, is in a Phase 3 study for DR without DME, entitled PANORAMA. 24-week and 52-week results demonstrated an improved rate of 2-step improvement in DRSS with repeated Eylea intraocular injections compared to sham injections.  Regeneron has submitted a sBLA supplement for the indication treatment of diabetic retinopathy based on these results (PDUFA date May 13, 2019).  In addition, we are aware that there are a number of other companies that are actively developing product candidates for the treatment of DR without DME. 
 DME—The principal competitors for our program in DME are the anti-Ang-2 antibodies REGN-910 (nesvacumab, from Regeneron) and RG7716 (bi-specific antibody which targets VEGF-A and Ang-2, from Roche/Genentech). Nesvacumab development was recently discontinued by Regeneron, while RG7716 recently initiated Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of DME. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product candidates. Subject to receiving marketing approval, we intend to independently pursue the commercialization of AKB-9778 in the United States for DR by building a focused sales and marketing organization. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of physicians who are key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed.
 We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue the approval and commercialization of AKB-9778 for DR through strategic collaborations. We may develop and commercialize AKB-9778 for other indications either independently or through collaborations with third parties. We may also develop and commercialize ARP-1536, subject to receiving additional funding, which may be from a collaboration with a strategic or commercial partner.
 Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We have relied on and intend to continue to rely on qualified third-party contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates, including clinical supplies to support our clinical trials. We expect that commercial quantities of any compound and materials for our product candidates, if approved, will be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with FDA and other regulations. At the appropriate time in the product development process, we will determine whether to establish manufacturing facilities or continue to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of any products that we may successfully develop.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of pharmaceutical and biological products, such as those we are developing. In addition, some government authorities regulate the pricing of such products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s 
 19


refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests and nonclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, or a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the clinical study sites to assure compliance with GCPs, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a biologic drug candidate that is safe, pure, and potent or an NDA for a drug candidate that is safe and effective prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug or biological product to humans in clinical trials. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan, the protocol(s) for human trials and the safety of study participants. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biological product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB, before the trials may be initiated and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 20


The clinical investigation of a drug or biological product is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug or biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety (or safety, purity, and potency for biological products), to evaluate the overall benefit-risk profile of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA or NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug or biological product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 Submission of a BLA or NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs and NDAs is subject to an application user fee. For fiscal year 2019, the application user fee is $2,588,478, and the sponsor of an approved BLA or NDA is also subject to an annual program fee of $309,915 for each approved prescription drug or biological product on the market. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA and NDA user fees and may be exempted from program fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.
 A BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including trials initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. Once a BLA or NDA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal for novel drug and biological products generally is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification.
 21


Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug or biological product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made.  An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on a BLA or NDA
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA or NDA and conducts relevant inspections, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will identify the deficiencies that prevent the FDA from approving the application and may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial.
 The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of BLAs and NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA during development and testing, the eligibility for priority review, and rolling review, which is submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted.
 Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant the BLA or NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application for a novel product at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA or NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing trials or completion of ongoing trials after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or 
 22


condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production, or distribution, or may require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or NDAs or supplements to approved BLAs or NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity
 A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end of Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. Development 
 23


program candidates designated as orphan drugs are exempt from the above requirements. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA or NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric trials are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the BLA or NDA sponsor’s data.
 Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of the product’s approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDA for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the nonclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is the same as the RLD with respect to the active ingredient(s), the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the labeling (with certain exceptions). At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if “the rate and 
 24


extent of absorption of the [generic] drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider an “A” therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of an “A” rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA (or a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted) may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, discussed below, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is not seeking approval.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge a listed patent, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until the listed patent expires (unless the patent claims only a method-of-using the referenced product and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant indicates that it is not seeking approval of the claimed method of use).
 If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of expiration of the patent, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant, or 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice (which can be extended if the reference product has 5-year exclusivity and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted between 4 and 5 years after approval of the reference product).
 European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional 
 25


product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP, the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA or NDA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.
 Countries that are part of the European Union, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of pharmaceutical and biologic products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Authorization Procedures in the European Union
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 
  
• | Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28-member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 26


 
a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults.
 New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Accelerated Review
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third- party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.

Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. For example, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, including eliminating a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, or any law replacing elements of it, on our business remains unclear. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 Further, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. In response to the Blueprint, on November 30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs.  Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre-authorization (PA) and step therapy (ST) for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs, changes the definition of “negotiated prices” in the regulations and adds a definition of “price concession” to the regulation. It is unclear whether these proposed changes will be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business and our ability to receive adequate reimbursement for our future products.
 In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal anti-inducement law which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 27 full-time or part-time employees, including 11 employees with doctorate level degrees. Of these employees, 17 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 10 employees are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good.
Our Corporate Information
 We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2007 under the name “Zeta Acquisition Corp. II.” Prior to our merger in March 2017, Zeta Acquisition Corp. II was a “shell” company registered under the Exchange Act with no specific business plan or purpose until it began operating the business of Aerpio through the merger on March 15, 2017, or the Merger. Aerpio was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2011 to focus primarily on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular disease. Effective upon the Merger, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zeta Acquisition Corp. II merged with and into Aerpio, and Aerpio continued as the operating subsidiary of Zeta Acquisition Corp. II. Immediately following the Merger, Aerpio converted into a Delaware limited liability company with the name Aerpio Therapeutics LLC.
 Our corporate headquarters are located at 9987 Carver Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45242, and our telephone number is (513) 985-1920. We maintain a website at www.aerpio.com, to which we regularly post copies of our press releases as well as additional information about us.
