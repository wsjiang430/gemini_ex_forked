Overview
We are a pioneer and leading provider of a cloud-based platform delivering security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology (IT) infrastructures, help protect their IT systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Our cloud solutions address the growing security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing, containers and serverless IT models, and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Our integrated suite of security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys cloud platform (Qualys Cloud Platform) enables our customers to identify and manage their IT assets, collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data, discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, recommend remediation actions and verify the implementation of such actions. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their IT asset inventory as well as security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures as our solution offers a single platform for information technology, information security, application security, endpoint, developer security and cloud teams.
IT infrastructures are more complex and globally-distributed today than ever before, as organizations of all sizes increasingly rely upon a myriad of interconnected information systems and related IT assets, such as servers, databases, web applications, routers, switches, desktops, laptops, other physical and virtual infrastructure, and numerous external networks and cloud services. In this environment, new and evolving digital technologies intended to improve organizations’ operations can also increase vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which can expose sensitive data, damage IT and physical infrastructures, and result in serious financial or reputational consequences. In addition, the rapidly increasing amount of data and devices in IT environments makes it more difficult to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The predominant approach to IT security has been to implement multiple disparate security products that can be costly and difficult to deploy, integrate and manage and may not adequately protect organizations. As a result, we believe there is a large and growing opportunity for comprehensive cloud-based IT security and compliance solutions delivered in a single platform.
We designed our Qualys Cloud Platform to transform the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructures and applications. Our cloud platform offers an integrated suite of solutions that automates the lifecycle of asset discovery and management, security assessments, and compliance management for an organization’s IT infrastructure and assets, whether such infrastructure and assets reside inside the organization, on their network perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. Since inception, our solutions have been designed to be delivered through the cloud and to be easily and rapidly deployed on a global scale, enabling faster implementation and lower total cost of ownership than traditional on-premises enterprise software products. Our customers, ranging from some of the largest global organizations to small businesses, are served from our globally-distributed cloud platform, enabling us to rapidly deliver new solutions, enhancements and security updates.
We believe that our cloud platform provides our customers with unique advantages, including:

• | No hardware to buy or manage. There is no infrastructure or software to buy and maintain thus reducing our customers’ operating costs; all services are accessible in the cloud via web interface. Qualys operates and maintains the platform.


• | Real-time visibility in one place, anytime and anywhere. Our customers can conveniently see their security and compliance posture across their global IT asset inventory in one browser window, without plugins or a virtual private network (VPN), whenever and wherever Internet access is available.


• | Easy global scanning. Our customers can easily perform scans on geographically distributed and segmented networks at the perimeter, behind the firewall, on dynamic cloud environments and on endpoints.


• | Seamless scaling. Our cloud platform is a scalable, comprehensive, and end-to-end solution for the IT security needs of our customers. Our customers can seamlessly add new coverage, users and services after they have deployed our platform.

• | Up to date resources. Qualys has one of the largest knowledge bases of vulnerability signatures in the industry. All security updates are made in real-time.


• | Data stored securely. Data is securely stored and processed in a multi-tiered architecture of load-balanced servers. Our encrypted databases are physically and logically secured.

We were founded and incorporated in December 1999 with a vision of transforming the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructure and applications and initially launched our first cloud solution, Vulnerability Management (VM), in 2000. As VM gained acceptance, we introduced additional solutions to help customers manage increasing IT security and compliance requirements. Today, the suite of solutions that we offer on our cloud platform and refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps helps our customers protect a range of on-premise assets, endpoints and cloud environments. These solutions and their Cloud Apps address and include: 

• | IT Security: Vulnerability Management (VM), Threat Protection (TP), Continuous Monitoring

(CM), indication of Compromise (IOC), Certificate Assessment (CRA); 

• | Compliance Monitoring: Policy Compliance (PC), PCI Compliance (PCI), File Integrity

Monitoring (FIM), Security Configuration Assessment (SCA), Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ); 

• | Web Application Security: Web Application Scanning (WAS), Web Application Firewall (WAF);


• | Global IT Asset Management: Asset Inventory (AI), CMDB Sync (SYN), Certificate Inventory (CRI); and


• | Cloud/Container Security: Cloud Inventory (CI), Cloud Security Assessment (CSA), Container Security

(CS). 
We provide our solutions through a software-as-a-service model, primarily with renewable annual subscriptions. These subscriptions require customers to pay a fee in order to access each of our cloud solutions. We generally invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term, and the invoiced amounts are treated as deferred revenues and are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription. We continue to experience significant revenue growth from our existing customers as they renew and purchase additional subscriptions. 
Our Qualys Cloud Platform is currently used by over 12,200 customers and active users in more than 130 countries, including a majority of each of the Forbes Global 100 and Fortune 100. Our revenues increased to $278.9 million in 2018 from $230.8 million in 2017 and $197.9 million in 2016. Our VM solutions (including VM, CM, TP, Cloud Agent for VM, allocated scanner revenue and Qualys Private Cloud Platform) have provided a majority of our revenues to date, representing 74%, 74% and 76% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We generated net income of $57.3 million in 2018, $40.4 million in 2017 and $19.2 million in 2016. Total assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $585.7 million and $537.5 million, respectively.

Our cloud platform is delivered to our customers via our shared platform offering from our global data centers, or via our private platform offering, Qualys Private Cloud Platform (PCP), for customers or partners that want the platform to reside within the customer's data center. The PCP is a standalone version of our multi-layer, multi-tenant services architecture and is a fully integrated turnkey solution, making it more scalable, cost effective and faster to deploy within a customer's data center. Solutions delivered through our PCP are typically on the same subscription basis as solutions delivered through our shared platform. Our PCP utilizes hardware and software owned by us and is physically located on the customer's premises. The customer is not permitted to take possession of the software or access the software code. We also offer our PCP as a subscription-based platform services to the customer using a virtual version of our software. This virtualized PCP allows us to extend our security and compliance solutions without the complexity and cost associated with deploying traditional enterprise software. Additionally, in 2016, we introduced the Private Cloud Platform Appliance (PCPA), an on-premises security and compliance solution packaged in a form-factor for medium-sized companies.

Qualys Cloud Apps
Many organizations have an array of heterogeneous point tools that do not interoperate well and are difficult and costly to maintain and integrate, making it difficult for Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to obtain a single, unified view of their organization’s security and compliance posture. The Qualys Cloud Platform and its Cloud Apps help organizations escape this tool-fragmentation dilemma by drastically simplifying their security stacks and regaining unimpeded visibility across their IT environment. 
The Cloud Apps are self-updating, centrally managed and tightly integrated, and cover a broad range of functionality in areas such as IT security, compliance monitoring, web application security, IT asset management and cloud and container security solutions.
From inception through December 31, 2017, we have added the following Cloud Apps: VM, PCI, PC, WAS, WAF, CM, SYN, SAQ, TP, FIM, IOC, AI and SCA. In 2018, we introduced a number of new applications including CS, CI, CSA, CRI and CRA.
We believe that our applications are easy to use and provide our customers with a high level of control because our applications are part of one platform, share a common user interface, utilize the same scanners and agents, access the same collected data, and leverage the same user permissions. 
Our customers can subscribe to one or more of our security and compliance Apps based on their initial needs and expand their subscriptions over time to new areas within their organization or to additional Qualys solutions. We offer four editions of our Qualys Cloud Apps: Enterprise for large enterprises, Express for medium-sized businesses, Express Lite for small-sized businesses, and Consulting Edition for consultants, consulting organizations and Managed Service Providers (MSPs).
Many of our customers use multiple Cloud Apps to develop a more complete understanding of their respective environment’s IT security and compliance posture. The Qualys Cloud Platform currently provides the following Cloud Apps to our customers:
IT Security
Vulnerability Management (VM): VM is an industry leading and award-winning solution that automates network auditing and vulnerability management across an organization, including network discovery and mapping, asset management, vulnerability reporting and remediation tracking. Driven by our comprehensive knowledge base of known vulnerabilities, VM enables cost-effective protection against vulnerabilities without substantial resource deployment.
Threat Protection (TP): Thousands of new vulnerabilities are disclosed annually. With TP, customers can pinpoint their most critical threats and identify what they need to remediate first. TP continuously correlates external threat information against a customer's vulnerabilities and IT asset inventory, so customers know which threats pose the greatest risk to their organization at any given time. As Qualys engineers continuously validate and rate new threats from internal and external sources, TP’s live feed displays the latest vulnerability disclosures and maps them to customers’ impacted IT assets. Customers can see the assets affected by each threat, and drill down into details.
Continuous Monitoring (CM): Built on top of VM, CM is a next-generation cloud service that can detect network threats and unexpected changes before they turn into breaches. Whenever CM spots an anomaly in a network, it immediately sends targeted, informative alerts to the right people for each situation and each machine. CM tracks what happens throughout public perimeters, internal networks, and cloud environments - anywhere in the world. 
Indication of Compromise (IOC): IOC delivers threat hunting, detects suspicious activity, and confirms the presence of known and unknown malware for devices both on and off the network. From its single console, customers can monitor current and historical system activity for all on-premises servers, user endpoints, and cloud instances - even for assets that are currently offline or have been re-imaged by IT. IOC utilizes the Cloud Agent to capture endpoint activity on files, processes, mutant handles, registries, and network connections, and uploads the data to the Qualys Cloud Platform for storage, processing, and query.
Certificate Assessment (CRA): CRA continuously assesses certificates and underlying SSL/TLS configurations and vulnerabilities across global IT assets to prevent downtime and outages, and mitigate risks from expired or vulnerable SSL/TLS certificates and configurations. Using a straight-forward methodology, it generates SSL Labs-
8

caliber certificate grades that allow non-experts to assess often-overlooked server SSL/TLS configurations. CRA also identifies out-of-policy certificates and features a fast and powerful search engine to look for specific certificates, vulnerabilities, configurations and grades. Dynamic dashboards create a holistic and contextual view of a certificate estate, and power automatically created downloadable reports. By continuously correlating certificate and configuration information with vulnerability data, CRA provides remediation prioritization decisions are rooted in accurate, up-to-date, applicable data. 
Compliance Monitoring
Policy Compliance (PC): PC performs automated security configuration assessments on IT systems throughout a network, helping to reduce risk and continuously ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations. PC leverages out-of-the-box library content to fast-track compliance assessments using industry-recommended best practices. PC also provides a centralized, interactive console for specifying baseline standards for different hosts. By automating requirement evaluation against multiple standards for OSes, network devices, databases and server applications, PC enables the quick identification of security issues and works to prevent configuration drift. PC works to prioritize and track remediation and exceptions, while demonstrating a repeatable auditable process for compliance management.
PCI Compliance (PCI): PCI streamlines and automates compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements for protecting the collection, storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. As an Approved Scanning Vendor, Qualys has been authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council to conduct the required quarterly scans. PCI scans all Internet-facing networks and systems with Six Sigma (99.9996%) accuracy, generates reports and provides detailed patching instructions. An auto-submission feature completes the compliance process once remediation is completed. 
File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): FIM logs and centrally tracks file change events on common enterprise operating systems in organizations of all sizes. FIM provides customers with a simple way to achieve centralized cloud-based visibility of activity resulting from normal patching and administrative tasks, change control exceptions or violations, or malicious activity - then reports on that system activity as part of compliance mandates. FIM collects the critical details needed to quickly identify changes and root out activity that violates policy or is potentially malicious. FIM helps customers to comply with change control policy enforcement and change monitoring requirements.
Security Configuration Assessment (SCA): SCA provides automatic assessment of IT assets’ configurations using the latest Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks for operating systems, databases, applications and network devices. SCA provides intuitive workflows for assessing, monitoring, reporting and remediating security-related configuration issues. SCA’s CIS assessments are provided via a web-based user interface and delivered from the Qualys Cloud Platform, enabling centralized management with minimal deployment overhead. SCA users can automatically create downloadable reports and view dashboards.
Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ): SAQ automates and streamlines third-party and internal risk assessment processes, obviating the need to perform such processes manually via email and spreadsheets. SAQ easily designs surveys to assess procedural controls of IT security policies and practices. SAQ automates the launch and monitoring of assessment campaigns, making the process agile, accurate, comprehensive, centralized, scalable and uniform across an organization. SAQ also provides tools for displaying, analyzing and acting on collected data, enabling the assessment of compliance with industry standards, regulations and internal policies of third parties, like vendors and partners, and of employees.
Web Application Security
Web Application Scanning (WAS): WAS continuously discovers and catalogs web applications - including new and unknown ones - and detects vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web apps and APIs. Scaling to thousands of scans, it conducts incisive, thorough and precise testing of browser-based web apps, mobile app backends, and Internet of things (IoT) services. Its seamless integration with the Qualys Web Application Firewall (WAF) enables verification of attack protection and one click mitigation of vulnerabilities. WAS' powerful API enables integration with other systems and allows teams to detect issues within DevOps environments early in the application development process. Bundled malware detection capability with WAS uses reputational, behavioral, antivirus, and heuristic analyses to identify and alert on malware infecting a user's websites. By Integrating WAS with manual testing tools and bug bounty solutions, customers can build a comprehensive web application vulnerability testing program.
9

Web Application Firewall (WAF): WAF permits the reduction of application security cost and complexity with a unified platform to prevent any attempt to exploit vulnerabilities. Simple, scalable and adaptive, WAF enables the quick blocking of attacks, prevents disclosure of sensitive information, and controls when and where customer applications are accessed. WAF and WAS work together seamlessly. Customers scan web apps with WAS, deploy one-click virtual patches if needed in WAF, and manage it all from a centralized cloud-based portal. WAF can be deployed in minutes on prem or in the cloud, as a virtual machine or a container, supports load-balancing as well as Transport Layer Security (TLS) offloading, and does not require special hardware.
Global IT Asset Management
Asset Inventory (AI): AI constantly gathers information on all assets, including system and hardware details, running services, open ports, installed software and user accounts. Asset discovery and inventory collection is done through a combination of Qualys network scanners and Cloud Agents, which together collect comprehensive data from on-premises or cloud infrastructure as well as remote endpoints. In order to create consistent and uniform asset data, AI normalizes raw discovery data to standardize every manufacturer name, product name, model and software version using Qualys’ ever-evolving technology catalog as a reference. This catalog automatically extends IT asset inventory with non-discoverable metadata such as hardware and software release dates, end of life dates, and license categories. This new data layer allows teams to detect issues such as unauthorized software, outdated hardware or end-of-life software, which can help properly support and secure critical assets.
CMDB Sync (SYN): SYN is a certified application that synchronizes Qualys AI data with ServiceNow’s Configuration Management system. Device changes are immediately transmitted to the Qualys Cloud Platform and then synchronized with ServiceNow. For customers, this means an end to unidentified and misclassified assets, and to data update delays, all of which increase chances of breaches. SYN provides real-time, comprehensive visibility of IT asset inventories enabling immediate detection of security and compliance risks.
Certificate Inventory (CRI): CRI continuously scans global IT assets from a single console to discover internal and external certificates issued from any certificate authority across all enterprise IT assets, both on premise and in the cloud. By doing so, it provides certificates can be renewed before they expire, which stops certificate-related outages and improves availability. It collects all certificate, vulnerability and configuration data required for certificate inventory and analysis. CRI also reveals how many certificates are out of compliance or do not follow organizational policies for key length, for signature algorithms or for the use of trusted and approved Certificate Authorities through the use of highly customizable dashboards and provides users a comprehensive overview of Qualys SSL Labs-caliber certificate grades for internal and externally facing certificates.
Cloud / Container Security
Cloud Inventory (CI): CI delivers continuous visibility into public cloud accounts. In one single-pane view, it inventories virtual machines, storage buckets, databases, security groups, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and users - across all regions, multiple accounts and multiple cloud platforms. CI continuously tracks assets and enables users to quickly understand the topography of their cloud environment and uncover the root cause of incidents.
Cloud Security Assessment (CSA): CSA provides a continuous assessment of the security posture of an organization’s cloud resources against misconfigurations, malicious behavior, and nonstandard deployments. CSA evaluates resources against CIS benchmarks and best practices to identify misconfigured storage buckets, security groups, Relational Database Service, exposing data and the resource for public exploitation. CSA correlates host vulnerabilities and compliance data into intelligent insights which allow users to quickly detect risks throughout their complex cloud environments. With CSA, users gain real-time visibility into their up-to-date security and compliance posture of public clouds in one single-pane view.
Container Security (CS): CS delivers container-native visibility and protection throughout the entire lifecycle of containerized applications. It incorporates scanning of container images for software composition and enforcement of hardened container stack configurations for continuous policy compliance, whether the images are on the build machines, in the container registries or in the runtime cluster nodes. CS uses a unique 'layered-in' approach to provide deep visibility into all the application activities and automatically creates a behavior profile, which is enforced on each container for runtime protection. By integrating with CI/CD pipelines and toolchains, CS enables DevSecOps processes and transparent enforcement of security and compliance without compromising the speed and agility of containers 
10

and serverless deployment models. This leads to significant cost benefits for enterprises compared to certain legacy security solutions.

Our competitors may also attempt to further expand their presence in the IT security and compliance market and compete more directly against one or more of our solutions.

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for cloud-based security and compliance solutions include product functionality, breadth of product offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership, scalability and performance, customer support and extensibility of platform. We believe that our suite of solutions generally competes favorably with respect to these factors. However, many of our primary competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. As of February 22, 2019, we have sixteen issued patents, several pending U.S. patent applications and an exclusive license to four U.S. patents, which was obtained in connection with our acquisition of Nemean in 2010. The inbound license remains in effect until the licensed patents are no longer enforceable, unless the applicable license agreement is first terminated by us or terminated by the licensor for a breach of the agreement or if we undergo certain bankruptcy events. The licenses are currently exclusive and will remain exclusive so long as we make an appropriately-timed written election and pay an annual fixed royalty for ten years thereafter. These exclusive licenses are subject to the licensor’s reservation of certain rights in the patents and subject to the U.S. government’s reserved rights in the technology. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, as we have spent years designing and developing the Qualys Cloud Platform, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,194 full-time employees, including 586 in research and development, 259 in sales and marketing, 231 in operations and customer support and 118 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2018, we had 418 employees in the United States and 776 employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees in certain European countries have collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 65% of our employees were located outside the United States, with 54% of our employees located in Pune, India.
