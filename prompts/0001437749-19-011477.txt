Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC®” or the “Company”) was founded on April 9, 1987. We are a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power solutions that enhance the performance of the power grid, protect our Navy’s fleet, and lower the cost of wind power. Our system level products leverage the Company’s proprietary “smart materials” and “smart software and controls” to provide enhanced resiliency and improved performance of megawatt-scale power flow.
 
In the power grid market, we enable electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and move power through our power electronics and superconductor-based systems as well as our transmission planning services. We help protect the U.S. Navy surface fleet with advanced superconductor-based systems and we enable the use of high-efficiency, high performance, and low-weight magnetic systems which provide superior performance advantages to the traditional methods of mine field protection for the Navy fleet. In the wind power market, we enable manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through our advanced power electronics and control system products, engineering, and support services. Our power grid and wind products and services provide exceptional reliability, security, efficiency, and affordability to our customers.
 
Our power system solutions help to improve energy efficiency, alleviate power capacity and other constraints, improve system resiliency, and increase the adoption of renewable energy generation. Demand for our solutions is driven by the growing needs for modernized smart grids that improve power reliability, security, and quality, the U.S. Navy’s effort to upgrade in-board power systems to support fleet electrification, and the need for increased renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar energy. Concerns about these factors have led to increased spending by corporations and the military, as well as supportive government regulations and initiatives on local, state and national levels, including renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives, and international treaties.
 
Market opportunities
 
We provide solutions that address three key drivers of our business:
 

• | the evolving electric grid;
--+----------------------------


• | the electrification of the Naval fleet; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | the global demand for renewable energy
--+---------------------------------------

 
Our power system products address five market opportunities (areas):
 

• | Transmission grid. We provide complete systems that enable electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect and transmit power with exceptional efficiency, reliability, security and affordability. We provide planning services that allow us to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality, and other risks, which help us determine how our solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of our grid interconnection solutions and power quality systems for wind farms and solar power plants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Distribution grid. We provide a direct-connect quality system that is installed on the primary distribution network in communities, business parks, or wherever enhanced power quality is beneficial and is designed to increase the reliability and resiliency of the distribution grid to serve the needs of modern energy consumers. Our systems save utilities time and money by avoiding costly options to strengthen the distribution grid.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Urban Grid Infrastructure: We design systems to increase the reliability, security and capacity of the urban grid infrastructure. Today, many urban substations are not networked and can only power a small section of a city. Our power dense technology based on proprietary smart materials allows for the inter-connection of substations, controlling the high fault currents that naturally result from such interconnections. If one substation is compromised, other substations help increase capacity and reliability. Our system allows instantaneous power outage recovery, potentially doubling to quadrupling a city’s reliability and resiliency while minimizing grid investment. We design systems that leverage existing grid assets while protecting cities against storms, outages, cyber and physical attacks.

Grid market overview
 
It is widely believed that the electricity grids around the world require modernization through widespread technology upgrades if they are to maintain reliability while solving rapidly evolving challenges such as more frequent severe weather, threats of physical- and cyber-attacks, expanded renewable generation (both large and small scale) and new types of customer loads such as electric vehicles.  In fact, a series of reports written by the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI") in 2016 emphasize the need for increased resiliency, flexibility and connectivity in electric grids.  According to the EPRI reports, the number of geophysical, meteorological, hydrological, and climatological events in the U.S. rose to an all-time high of 247 events in 2010 – up from approximately 200 in 2009 and less than 200 in all years combined from 1980 to 2010.  Available data further indicate that the existing U.S. electrical grid has been stressed by U.S. wind power generation increasing from 8.7 Gigawatts ("GW") in 2005 to 82 GW in 2017, and photovoltaics ("PV") power generation increasing from almost zero in 2003 to nearly 50 GW as of the end of 2018. 
 
Growth in both wind power and PV is expected to continue with the vast majority of such intermittent generation sources unsupported by energy storage, placing stress on the power grid.  Finally, the Edison Electric Institute estimates that the number of electric vehicles on the road in the U.S. is projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from slightly more than 1 million at the end of 2018.  These facts and the dependence on the safety, security and economy of the electricity grid have prompted broad recognition worldwide of the need to modernize and enhance the reliability and security of power grids.

Power grid operators worldwide face various challenges, including:
 

• | Stability. Power grid operators are confronting power quality and stability issues arising from intermittent renewable energy sources and from the capacity limitations of transmission and overhead distribution lines and underground cables.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliability. Traditional transmission lines and cables often reach their reliable voltage stability limit well below their thermal threshold. Driving more power through a power grid when some lines and cables are operating above their voltage stability limit during times of peak demand can cause either unacceptably low voltage in the power grid (a brownout) or risk of a sudden, uncontrollable voltage collapse (a blackout).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capacity. The traditional way to enable increases in power grid capacity without losing voltage stability is to install more overhead power lines and underground cables. However, permitting new transmission and distribution lines can take 10 years or more due to various public policy issues, such as environmental, aesthetic, and health concerns. In urban and metropolitan areas, installing additional conventional underground copper cables is similarly challenging, since many existing underground corridors carrying power distribution cables are already filled to their physical capacity and cannot accommodate any additional conventional cables. In addition, adding new conduits requires excavation to expand existing corridors or create new corridors, which are costly and disruptive undertakings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiency. Most overhead lines and underground cables use traditional conductors such as copper and aluminum, which lose power due to electrical resistance. At transmission voltage, electrical losses average about 7% in the United States and other developed nations, but can exceed 20% in some locations due to the distance of the line, quality of the conductor, and the power grid’s architecture and characteristics, among other factors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Catastrophic equipment failures caused by aging equipment, physical and cyber events, and weather-related disasters can leave entire sections of an urban environment without power for hours or days. It can be difficult to recover from extended power outages in urban load centers, worsening situations where the personal safety of residents and the economic health of businesses are threatened. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our solutions for the power quality and grid infrastructure market
 
We address these challenges in the grid market by providing services and solutions designed to increase the power grid’s capacity, resiliency, reliability, security and efficiency. Our solutions include:
 

• | D-VAR® Systems. Our D-VAR system is a system that consists of power electronics and other static components used for controlling power flow and voltage in the AC transmission system. Our D-VAR system aims to increase controllability and power transferability of a network, which allows more effective utilization of existing assets, and reduces the need for new transmission lines and facilities to increase electricity availability. The power that flows through AC networks comprises both real power, measured in watts, and reactive power, measured in Volt Amp Reactive (“VARs”). In simple terms, reactive power is required to support voltage in the power network. D-VAR systems can provide the reactive power needed to stabilize voltage on the grid. These systems also can be used to connect wind farms and solar power plants to the power grid seamlessly as well as to protect certain industrial facilities against voltage swells and sags. Our D-VAR sales process begins with our group of experienced transmission planners working with power grid operators, renewable energy developers, and industrial system operators to identify power grid constraints and determine how our solutions might improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, and power quality systems for utilities and heavy industrial operations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | D-VAR VVO®. We believe D-VAR VVO will allow us to enter the market for products to serve the distribution power grid. VVO is designed to be a direct-connect 15 kilovolt class power quality system for a utility's distribution network to optimally control voltage as distribution networks are increasingly impacted by distributed generation, such as roof top and community solar. We believe VVO has the potential to save utilities time and money by avoiding costly options to increase the reliability and resiliency of the distribution grid and to allow utilities to build a “plug 'n play” network to serve the demands of modern energy consumers. The intended target markets of VVO are electric distribution grids incorporating distributed generation, including where utility grid modernization attributes such as the following are applicable: mandated efficiency upgrades, mass adoption of rooftop solar, community solar, utility-owned micro-girds, variable load conditions on the distribution grid and voltage regulations alternatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | REG Systems. Our REG system has two primary applications that increase the reliability and the capacity of the urban infrastructure. For applications focused on reliability improvement, the REG system is used in a “ring” or “loop” configuration to interconnect nearby urban substations. This enables urban utilities to share transmission connections and excess station capacity, while controlling the high fault currents that naturally result from such interconnections, providing protection against the adverse effects that follow the loss of critical substation facilities in urban areas. We believe a utility installing our REG system could double or quadruple its reliability (e.g. N-1 to N-2, or greater) by networking substations, which is a solution that utilities would generally not consider when using conventional technology due to the disruptive nature and economic disadvantages of conventional technology in urban settings. For applications focused on capacity improvement, the REG system can be used in a “branch” configuration. In this application, the REG system connects an existing large urban substation with a new, much smaller, and more simplified substation within the city at a lower cost. The smaller urban substation does not need large power transformers and takes up much less space, thereby significantly reducing real estate, construction, and other related costs in the urban area. The key component to the REG system is a breakthrough cable system that combines very high-power handling capacity with fault current limiting characteristics - features that are attributable to our proprietary Amperium HTS wire.

Marine market overview
 
Defense spending has increased over the past two years as the U.S. military moves to rebuild and retool for competition against other great powers. In spring 2018, the Department of Defense submitted the Navy’s 2019 shipbuilding plan to Congress, covering government fiscal years 2019 to 2048, which if fully carried out, will represent the largest naval buildup since the Reagan Administration in the 1980s. In September 2018, the Navy’s fleet numbered 285 battle force ships. The Navy’s requirement, as stated in its 2019 shipbuilding plan, is to build and maintain a larger fleet of 355 battle force ships. The United States’ fiscal year 2019 defense budget includes a $299 million request for the Navy Laser Family of Systems, which the Navy has designated a fast-track initiative, to provide near-term, ship-based laser weapon capabilities. We believe such new warfighting capabilities will require an HTS-based power distribution solution, potentially creating further demand for our system.
 
Since WWII, the Navy fleet has protected its warfare vessels with copper-based degaussing systems. Our HTS-based degaussing system provides world class mine protection while reducing the weight of the degaussing system by as much as 80%, and reducing energy consumption by more than half that of legacy degaussing systems.
 
We believe that our HTS systems are an enabling technology for the Navy in its mission to create an all-electric ship (Super Ship). Our HTS-based SPS degaussing system has been designed into the San Antonio-class amphibious warfare ship platform, starting with LPD 28.  AMSC and the U.S. Navy have collaborated on AMSC’s advanced HTS-based ship protection systems. The core components of the ship protection system are common and transferable to other applications being targeted for ship implementation.
 
Navy fleets worldwide face various challenges, including:
 

• | Power Capacity: Today’s Navy continues to see increased demand for more power applied from both on and off the ship (shore power). This need is driven by many factors, including the continued development of high-power density advanced weapons systems and sensors. Many power dense applications that naval engineers are working on today are already relying on the independent development of improved power distribution systems for its implementation. Free Electron Lasers, High Power Radar, Laser Self Defense Systems, Electro Magnetic Rail Guns and Active Denial (Directed Energy) systems are just a few of the Navy applications that we believe will demand higher capacity and more efficient energy transfer before deployment to a platform in the fleet can be realized.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Space and Weight Limitations: Advances in sensors and weapons for modern ship applications are expected to drive the need for new power solutions to be light and compact, for weapons’ power draw to be more efficiently cooled and for easing installation on new ships and enabling upgrades on existing ones.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiency: Increased power demands for routine (peace time) operations are straining the conventional copper based power cable systems that are currently used. The copper cables are very heavy, cumbersome, and hard to handle. The weight of the cables requires a coordinated effort between a crew on the pier and a crew on the ship. In many instances, handling these cables requires the use of a crane or a boom truck to extend them from the pier-side power substations up to the ship’s connection point. More efficient, compact, lighter weight power transfer and distribution systems are expected to be required for tomorrow’s Navy to satisfy its future mission requirements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our solutions for the marine market
 
Each Navy ship can be thought of as having its own power grid.  We provide advanced ship protection systems, power management, and power generation systems that are designed to help fleets increase system efficiencies, enhance warfare capabilities, and boost reliability, performance and security. Our systems support the Navy’s mission to “electrify the fleet”.  Our systems allow for the ship to generate a large amount of electrical power and distribute the  power through an in-board power system to a propulsion motor by way of a much smaller, lighter, and higher performing HTS cable system, enabling a more advanced, reliable, and secure solution with a smaller footprint. Our solutions include:
 

• | Ship Protection Systems. The primary focus of our SPS has been degaussing systems. These systems reduce a naval ship’s magnetic signature, making it much more difficult for a mine to detect and damage a ship. Traditionally made of heavy copper wire, degaussing is required on all U.S. Navy combat ships. Our HTS advanced degaussing system is lightweight, compact, and often outperforms its conventional counterpart. This HTS system is estimated to enable up to an 80% reduction in total degaussing system weight, offering significant potential for fuel savings or options to add different payloads. The core components of a degaussing system are transferable to other applications being targeted for ship implementation. Our SPS has been designed into the San Antonio class of amphibious assault vessels. We are also seeking opportunities to propagate SPS throughout the surface fleet, creating a relatively long-term revenue stream. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Board Power Delivery Systems. We are working on expanding HTS technology into the fleet through a variety of applications, including in board power flow and management. The Navy continues to see increased demand for more power. This need is driven by many factors, including the continued development of high power density advanced weapons systems and sensors. Many power dense applications that naval engineers are working on today are already relying on improved power distribution systems for their implementation and deployment. Free Electron Lasers, High Power Radar, Laser Self Defense Systems, Electro Magnetic Rail Guns and Active Denial (Directed Energy) systems are just a few of the Navy applications that will demand higher capacity and more efficient energy transfer before deployment to a platform in the fleet can be realized. Continued space and weight limitations for these ship applications are expected to drive the need for new power solutions to be light and compact, easing installation on new ships and enabling upgrades on existing ones. Our HTS power cables enable high density energy transfer at unsurpassed efficiency levels in a compact, lightweight package. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Power Generation Systems. We are also working on expanding HTS technology into the fleet through a variety of applications including power generation and electric propulsion. The same HTS technology used in SPS and in board power delivery systems when applied to rotating machines results in high power density motors and generators. This enables dramatically more power to be produced in the same machinery space used for conventional systems, which in turn affords the Navy additional power for high energy density weapons without significant structural changes to the ship. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Propulsion systems. Our development work in power generation systems for the Navy extends to HTS-based electric power propulsion. In board power delivery systems and power generation systems, when applied to high power density motors, enable the transition to electric propulsion. We, along with Northrop Grumman Corp. successfully completed a full-power test of the world’s first 36.5-MW HTS ship propulsion motor. The motor, rated at 49,000 horsepower, was successfully tested for a large U.S. Navy combatant ship at the Navy’s integrated power system land-based test site in Philadelphia. Incorporating coils of HTS wire that are able to carry 150 times the current of similar-sized copper wire makes the motor less than half the size of conventional motors used on the first two DDG-1000 hulls and will reduce ship weight by nearly 200 metric tons. This is expected to make new ships more fuel-efficient. Our technology and systems allow the Navy to free up space for additional war-fighting capability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wind market overview
 
The global energy mix is transitioning towards an increasing amount of renewable energy, including wind power. Wind power is unlimited in supply and its generation is a zero-emission process. Wind power has become a major pillar of power supply throughout the world. Wind power is expected to play a key role in the achievement of the objectives of the Paris Climate Change agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.
 
According to GlobalData, a research firm, approximately 52 GW of wind generation capacity were added worldwide in calendar 2018, as compared to 51 GW in calendar 2017.  GlobalData anticipates that more than 57 GW of additional capacity will be added in 2019.
 
According to GlobalData, annual wind installations in India for calendar 2018 were 1.6 GW and for calendar 2019 are estimated to be 2.7 GW.
 
Several factors are expected to drive the future growth in the wind power market, including substantial government incentives and mandates that have been established globally, technological improvements, turbine cost reductions, the development of the offshore wind market, and increasing cost competitiveness with existing power generation technologies.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our strategy is to serve customers locally in our core target markets through a direct sales force operating out of sales offices worldwide. In addition, we utilize manufacturers’ sales representatives in the United States to market our products to utilities in North America.  The sales force also leverages business development staff for our various offerings as well as our team of wind turbine engineers and power grid transmission planners, all of whom help to ensure that we have an in-depth understanding of customer needs and provide cost-effective solutions for those needs.
Segments
 
We segment our operations into two market-facing business units: Wind and Grid. We believe this market-centric structure enables us to more effectively anticipate and meet the needs of wind turbine manufacturers, power generation project developers, the Navy's ship protection systems and electric utilities.
Competition
 
We face competition in various aspects of our technology and product development. We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace depends upon several factors, including technical innovation, range of products and services, product quality and reliability, customer service and technical support.
 
We face competition from other companies offering FACTS systems similar to our D-VAR products. These include adaptive VAR compensators, Dynamic voltage restorers (“DVRs”), and STATCOMs produced by ABB, Siemens, and Ingeteam, and battery-based uninterruptable power supply (“UPS”) systems offered by various companies around the world.
 
With our HTS-based REG product, we are offering a new approach that provides alternatives to utilities for power system design. Therefore, we believe that we compete with traditional approaches such as new full-sized substations, overhead and underground transmission, and urban power transformers.
 
We believe we are currently the only company that can offer HTS-based SPS products that have been fully qualified for use aboard U.S. Navy surface combatants.  Therefore, the primary competition for our SPS products is currently coming from defense contractors that provide the copper-based systems that our lighter, more efficient HTS versions have been developed to replace.  Companies such as L3, Excelis, Raytheon, and Textron have the bulk of the copper-based business today.  
 
Our power module conversion equipment and our electrical control systems are designed and integrated into our wind turbine designs in a way to achieve maximum performance of the turbine. Typically, we are the exclusive provider of the power module conversion equipment and electrical control systems for our wind turbine designs. As a result, our power conversion equipment and electrical control systems see limited competition. Other companies that serve the wind turbine components industry include ABB, and Semikron. We also face indirect competition in the wind energy market from global manufacturers of wind turbines, such as Siemens Gamesa, General Electric, and Suzlon. We face competition for the supply of wind turbine engineering design services from design engineering firms such as Aerodyn.
 
Patents, licenses and trade secrets
 
Patent Background
 
An important part of our business strategy is to develop a strong worldwide patent position in all of our technology areas. Our intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio includes both patents we own and patents we license from others. We devote substantial resources to building a strong patent position. Together with the international counterparts of our patents and patent applications, we own an extensive portfolio of patents and patent applications worldwide, and have rights through exclusive and non-exclusive licenses. We believe that our current patent position, together with our ability to obtain licenses from other parties to the extent necessary, will provide us with sufficient proprietary rights to develop and sell our products. However, for the reasons described below, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.
 
Despite the strength of our patent position, a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications of third parties relate to our current products, to products we are developing, or to technology we are now using in the development or production of our products. We may need to acquire licenses to those patents, contest the scope or validity of those patents, or design around patented processes or applications as necessary. If companies holding patents or patent applications that we need to license are competitors, we believe the strength of our patent portfolio will significantly improve our ability to enter into license or cross-license arrangements with these companies. We have already successfully negotiated cross-licenses with several competitors.
 
Failure to obtain all necessary patents, licenses and other IP rights upon reasonable terms could significantly reduce the scope of our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not now know the likelihood of successfully contesting the scope or validity of patents held by others. In any event, we could incur substantial costs in challenging the patents of other companies. Moreover, third parties could challenge some of our patents or patent applications, and we could incur substantial costs in defending the scope and validity of our own patents or patent applications whether or not a challenge is ultimately successful.
 
Wind and Grid Patents
 
We have received patents and filed a significant number of additional patent applications on power quality and reliability systems, including our D-VAR products. Our products are covered by patents and patents pending worldwide on both our systems and power converter products. The patents and applications focus on inventions that significantly improve product performance and reduce product costs, thereby providing a competitive advantage. One invention of note allows for a reduction in the number of power inverters required in the system by optimally running the inverters in overload mode, thereby significantly reducing overall system costs. Another important invention uses inverters to offset transients due to capacitor bank switching, which provides improved system performance.
 
Under our Windtec Solutions™ brand, we design a variety of wind turbine systems and license these designs, including expertise and patent rights, to third parties for an upfront fee, plus in some cases, future royalties. Our wind turbine designs are covered by patents and patents pending worldwide on wind turbine technology. We have patent coverage on the unique design features of our blade pitch control system, which ensures optimal aerodynamic flow conditions on the turbine blades and improves system efficiency and performance. The pitch system includes a patented SafetyLOCK™ feature that causes the blades to rotate to a feathered position to prevent the rotor blades from spinning during a fault.

HTS Patents
 
Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors in 1986, rapid technical advances have characterized the HTS industry, which in turn have resulted in a large number of patents, including overlapping patents, relating to superconductivity. As a result, the patent situation in the field of HTS technology and products is unusually complex. We have obtained licenses to patents and patent applications covering some HTS materials. We currently have non-exclusive rights to a fundamental U.S. patent (U.S. 8,060,169 B1) covering 2G and similar HTS wire and applications and may elect in the future to allow our rights under this license to lapse. However, we may have to obtain additional licenses to HTS materials and, upon expiration of U.S. 8,060,169 patent to the materials covered by such patent.
 
We are focusing on the production of our Amperium wire, and we intend to continue to maintain a leadership position in 2G HTS wire through a combination of patents, licenses and proprietary expertise. In addition to our owned patents and patent applications in 2G HTS wire, we have obtained licenses from (i) MIT for the MOD process we use to deposit the YBCO layer, and (ii) Alcatel-Lucent on the YBCO material.
 
We have extensive patents and patents pending covering applications of HTS wire, such as HTS fault current limiting technology including our fault current limiting cable, HTS rotating machines and ship protection systems. Since the superconductor rotating machine and the fault current limiting cable applications are relatively new, we are building a particularly strong patent position in these areas. At present, we believe we have the world’s broadest and most fundamental patent position in superconductor rotating machines technology. We have also filed a series of patents on our concept for our proprietary fault current limiting technology. However, there can be no assurance that that these patents will be sufficient to assure our freedom of action in these fields without further licensing from others. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding the status of the commercialization of our Amperium wire products.
 
Trade Secrets
 
Some of the important technology used in our operations and products is not covered by any patent or patent application owned by or licensed to us. However, we take steps to maintain the confidentiality of this technology by requiring all employees and all consultants to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access to confidential information. We cannot provide any assurance that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of that information. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that others, including our competitors, will not independently develop the same or comparable technology that is one of our trade secrets.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we employed 233 persons, of which 223 are full time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.

 1. Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity
 
Nature of the Business and Operations
 
American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC®” or the “Company”) was founded on April 9, 1987. The Company is a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power solutions that enhance the performance of the power grid, protect the Navy’s fleet, and lower the cost of wind power. The Company’s products leverage its proprietary “smart materials” and “smart software and controls” to provide enhanced resiliency and improved performance of megawatt-scale power flow.
 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-K. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue operations and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
 
Liquidity
 
The Company has historically experienced recurring operating losses, although the Company generated net income of $26.8 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and as of March 31, 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $961.5 million. In addition, although the Company generated positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2018, the Company has historically experienced recurring negative operating cash flows.  At March 31, 2019, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $78.2 million. Cash provided by operations for the year ended March 31, 2019 was $42.7 million. 
 
On July 3, 2018, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Suzhou AMSC Superconductor Co. Ltd. (“AMSC China”) and AMSC Austria GMBH (“AMSC Austria”) entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd. (“Sinovel”). The Settlement Agreement settled the litigation and arbitration proceedings between the Company and Sinovel. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Sinovel agreed to pay AMSC China an aggregate cash amount in Renminbi (“RMB”) equivalent to $57.5 million, consisting of two installments. Sinovel paid the first installment of the RMB equivalent of $32.5 million on July 4, 2018, which was repatriated to the U.S. entity during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, and paid the second installment of the RMB equivalent of $25.0 million on December 27, 2018.  The Company's fiscal 2018 results include the net gain received from the settlement with Sinovel of $52.7 million.
 
On February 1, 2018, ASC Devens LLC (the “Seller”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “PSA”) with 64 Jackson, LLC (the “Purchaser”) and Stewart Title Guaranty Company (“Escrow Agent”), to effectuate the sale of certain real property located at 64 Jackson Road, Devens, Massachusetts, including the building that had served as the Company’s headquarters (collectively, the “Property”), in exchange for total consideration of $23.0 million, composed of (i) cash consideration of $17.0 million, and (ii) a $6.0 million subordinated secured commercial promissory note payable to the Company (the “Seller Note”). Subsequently, the Seller, the Purchaser and Jackson 64 MGI, LLC (“Assignee”) entered into an Assignment of Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which the Purchaser assigned all of its rights and interests in the PSA to the Assignee and the Assignee agreed to assume all of the Purchaser’s obligations and liabilities under the PSA. The transaction closed on March 28, 2018, at which time the Company received, from the Assignee, cash consideration, net of certain agreed upon closing costs, of $16.9 million, and the Seller Note at an interest rate of 1.96%. The Seller Note is secured by a subordinated second mortgage on the Property and a subordinated second assignment of leases and rents.  The Company received the first $3.0 million payment due pursuant to the Seller Note on March 28, 2019.
 
In December 2015, the Company entered into a set of strategic agreements valued at approximately $210.0 million with Inox Wind Ltd. (“Inox” or “Inox Wind”), which includes a multi-year supply contract pursuant to which the Company will supply electrical control systems to Inox and a license agreement allowing Inox to manufacture a limited number of electrical control systems. After Inox purchases the specified number of electrical control systems required under the terms of the supply contract, Inox agreed that the Company will continue as Inox’s preferred supplier and Inox will be required to purchase from the Company a majority of its electrical control systems requirements for an additional three-year period.
 
The Company believes that based on the information presented above and its annual management assessment, it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months following the issuance of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019. The Company’s liquidity is highly dependent on its ability to increase revenues, including its ability to collect revenues under its agreements with Inox, its ability to control its operating costs, and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital, on favorable terms or at all, from other sources or execute on any other means of improving liquidity described above.

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications of prior years’ amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, cash flows from operating activities or stockholders’ equity.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of receivables, realizability of inventory, goodwill and intangible assets, warranty provisions, stock-based compensation, valuation of warrant and derivative liabilities, tax reserves, and deferred tax assets. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While for any given estimate or assumption made by the Company’s management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable, the Company believes that, given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
 
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable consist of amounts owed by commercial companies and government agencies. Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of customers. As of March 31, 2019, Vestas accounted for approximately 21% and RES System 3, LLC accounted for approximately 16% of the Company's total receivable balance, with no other customer accounting for greater than 10% of the balance.  As of March 31, 2018, Inox accounted for approximately 32% and Fuji Bridex Pte Ltd for approximately 17% of the Company’s total receivable balance, with no other customer accounting for greater than 10% of the balance.  Changes in the financial condition or operations of the Company’s customers may result in delayed payments or non-payments which would adversely impact its cash flows from operating activities and/or its results of operations. As such, the Company may require collateral, advanced payment or other security based upon the customer history and/or creditworthiness. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based primarily on the probability of recoverability based on historical collection and write-off experience, the age of past due receivables, specific customer circumstances, and current economic trends. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional allowances may be required. Failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Inventory
 
Inventories include material, direct labor and related manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value determined on a first-in, first-out basis as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company records inventory when it takes delivery and title to the product according to the terms of each supply contract.
 
Program costs may be deferred and recorded as inventory on contracts on which costs are incurred in excess of approved contractual amounts and/or funding, if future recovery of the costs is deemed probable.
 
At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. Inventories that management considers excess or obsolete are reserved. Management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.
 
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded inventory reserves of approximately $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, based on evaluating its ending inventory on hand for excess quantities and obsolescence.
 
 43



Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company accounts for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification | Estimated Useful Life in Years 
---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
Building | 40 
Process upgrades to the building | 10-40 
Machinery and equipment | 3-10 
Furniture and fixtures | 3-5 
Leasehold improvements | Shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term



Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, consisting principally of fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets, for potential impairment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the treatment of long-lived assets, the Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets or asset group that is held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Under the held and used approach, the asset or asset group to be tested for impairment should represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
 
There were no indicators requiring impairment testing on the Company's long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
Goodwill
 
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill on February 28th of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Determining whether a triggering event has occurred often involves significant judgment from management. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit based on an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow adjusted for entity specific factors. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an entity should consider the totality of all relevant events or circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded. See Note 4, "Acquisition and Related Goodwill" for further information and discussion.
 
The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on February 28, 2019 and noted no triggering events from the analysis date to March 31, 2019 and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill.  Additionally, there was no impairment identified for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 based on the assessment performed in prior year.
 
 44



Equity Method Investments
 
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in entities in which it has an ownership interest, but does not exercise a controlling interest in the operating and financial policies of an investee. Under this method, an investment is carried at the acquisition cost, plus the Company’s equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.
 
The Company periodically tests its investments for potential impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a loss in the fair value of the investments may be other than temporary.  There were no minority investments as of March 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
Revenue Recognition 
 
On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method, therefore prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of this guidance has led to recognizing certain revenue transactions sooner than in the past on certain contracts, as the Company will need to estimate the revenue it will be entitled to upon contract completion, and later on other contracts, such as Consulting and Statement of Work transactions, due to the lack of an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations satisfied over time, specifically in the technology product line.
 
Revenue contracts are defined as an arrangement that creates enforceable rights and obligations of both parties where collection of the contract price is deemed probable. The Company records revenue based on a five-step model which includes identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing the revenue when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control  can occur at the time of delivery, installation or post-installation where applicable.  
 
For certain arrangements, such as contracts to perform research and development, prototype development contracts and certain customized product sales, the Company records revenues using the over-time method, measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Over-time revenue recognition accounting is predominantly used on certain turnkey power systems installations for electric utilities and long-term prototype development contracts with the U.S. government. The Company follows this method when any of the three following criteria are met: when the customer receives the benefits as they are performed, control transfers to the customer as the work is performed, or there is no alternative use to the Company and there is an enforceable right to payment through the life of the contract. However, the ability to reliably estimate total costs at completion is challenging, especially on long-term prototype development contracts, and could result in future changes in contract estimates. For contracts where reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs cannot be made, the Company follows the point in time method.
 
The Company enters into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer. Sales of certain products may include extended warranty and support or service packages, and at times include performance bonds. As these contracts progress, the Company continually assesses the probability of a payout from the performance bond. Should the Company determine that such a payout is likely; the Company would record a liability. The Company would reduce revenue to the extent a liability is recorded. In addition, the Company enters into licensing arrangements that include training services.
 
Performance obligations are separated into more than one unit of accounting when (1) the delivered element(s) have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and (2) the Company's promise to transfer the goods or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.  In general, revenues are separated between the different product shipments which have stand-alone value, and the various services to be provided. Revenue for product shipments is generally recognized at a point in time where control of the product is transferred to the customer, while revenues for the services are generally recognized over the period of performance. The Company identifies all goods and/or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price ("SSP") which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach for products and a relief from royalty method for licenses.  Revenue allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.  The Company reviews SSP and the related margins at least annually. 
 
 45



The Company’s license agreements provide either for the payment of contractually determined paid-up front license fees or milestone based payments in consideration for the grant of rights to manufacture and or sell products using its patented technologies or know-how. Some of these agreements provide for the release of the licensee from past and future intellectual property infringement claims. When the Company can determine that it has no further obligations other than the grant of the license and that the Company has fully transferred the technology know-how, the Company recognizes the revenue under a point in time model. In other license arrangements, the Company may also agree to provide training services to transfer the technology know-how.  In these arrangements, the Company has determined that the licenses have no standalone value to the customer and are not separable from training services as the Company can only fully transfer the technology know-how through the training component. Accordingly, the Company accounts for these arrangements as a single unit of accounting, and recognizes revenue over the period of its performance using the over-time method. Costs for these arrangements are expensed as incurred.
 
Existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined that collectability of any portion of the contract value is not probable, an analysis of variable consideration will be performed using either the most likely amount or expected value method to determine the amount of revenue that must be constrained until the scenario causing the variability has been resolved. For contractual arrangements that involve variable consideration, the Company recognizes revenue for these amounts upon reaching the constraining event successfully.  The Company does not generally provide for extended payment terms or provide its customers with a right of return.
 
Infrequently, the Company receives requests from customers to hold product being purchased from us for a valid business purpose. The Company recognizes revenues for such arrangements provided the transaction meets, at a minimum, the following criteria: a valid business purpose for the arrangement exists; risk of ownership of the purchased product has been transferred to the buyer; there is a fixed delivery date that is reasonable and consistent with the buyer’s business purpose; the product is ready for shipment; the Company has no continuing performance obligation in regards to the purchased product and these products have been segregated from our inventories and cannot be used to fill other orders received. There were no such transactions in revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, such transactions recognized as revenue were $3.7 million.
 
The Company has elected to record taxes collected from customers on a net basis and does not include tax amounts in revenue or costs of revenue.
 
The Company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances. 
 
See Note 3, “Revenue Recognition,” for further information regarding the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
 
Product Warranty
 
Warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of the Company’s products. The Company generally provides a one to three year warranty on its products, commencing upon installation. The costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Research and Development Costs
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
 46



Income Taxes
 
The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.
 
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. and China deferred income tax assets since the Company believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets are not currently realizable due to uncertainty around profitability in the future.
 
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company includes interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.  See Note 13, “Income Taxes,” for further information regarding its income tax assumptions and expenses.
 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act") was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 34% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings.  See Note 13, “Income Taxes,” for further information regarding its income tax assumptions and expenses.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions using a fair value-based method and recognizes the related expense in the results of operations.
 
Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards with service and performance conditions. For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service/vesting period. For awards with performance conditions, accruals of compensation cost are made based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.
 
Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatilities of the Company’s common stock and expected terms. The expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of the Company’s common stock. The expected term represents the average time that the options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and the Company’s historical exercise, cancellation and expiration patterns.
 
The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense based on historical and forward-looking factors. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant, unanticipated increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense from period to period. The termination of employment of certain employees who hold large numbers of stock-based awards may also have a significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on stock-based compensation expense. The Company will update these assumptions on at least an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted.
 
The Company's adoption of ASU 2018-07 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-Employee Share Based Payment Accounting on April 1, 2018 also resulted in the accounting for share-based payments made to non-employees to be accounted for in the same manner as other share-based payments for employees, with the measurement being based on the fair value at the grant date. The non-employee share based payments will be included within the Company's stock compensation currently reported.

Computation of Net Income (Loss) per Common Share
 
Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares include the effect of restricted stock, exercise of stock options and warrants and contingently issuable shares. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, common equivalent shares of 907,988, and 1,157,895, respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they were considered antidilutive. The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the EPS calculation for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands except per share amounts):
 
 
 | Fiscal year ended March 31, | 
----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | 
Numerator: | | | | | | | 
Net income (loss) | $ | 26,761 | | | $ | (32,776 | )
Denominator: | | | | | | | 
Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding | | 21,265 | | | | 19,621 | 
Weighted-average shares subject to repurchase | | (930 | ) | | | (654 | )
Shares used in per-share calculation — basic | | 20,335 | | | | 18,967 | 
Shares used in per-share calculation — diluted | | 20,726 | | | | 18,967 | 
Net income (loss) per share — basic | $ | 1.32 | | | $ | (1.73 | )
Net income (loss) per share — diluted | $ | 1.29 | | | $ | (1.73 | )

Foreign Currency Translation
 
The functional currency of all the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for AMSC Austria, for which the local currency (Euro) is the functional currency, and AMSC China, for which the local currency (Renminbi) is the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of AMSC Austria and AMSC China are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are excluded from net loss and shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations and were $1.6 million and ($2.8) million, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company has no restrictions on the foreign exchange activities of its foreign subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends and other distributions.
Risks and Uncertainties
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and would impact future results of operations and cash flows.
 
The Company invests its available cash in high credit, quality financial instruments and invests primarily in investment-grade marketable securities, including, but not limited to, government obligations, money market funds and corporate debt instruments.
 
Several of the Company’s government contracts are being funded incrementally, and as such, are subject to the future authorization, appropriation, and availability of government funding. The Company has a history of successfully obtaining financing under incrementally-funded contracts with the U.S. government and it expects to continue to obtain additional contract modifications in the year ending March 31, 2020 and beyond as incremental funding is authorized and appropriated by the government.
 
Contingencies
 
From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. If, with respect to a matter, it is not both probable to result in liability and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, an estimate of possible loss or range of loss is disclosed unless such an estimate cannot be made. The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until they are realized. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. See Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for further information.
Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, warrants to purchase shares of common stock, derivatives, and a senior secured term loan. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued expenses due to their short nature approximate fair value at March 31, 2019 and 2018. The estimated fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources and management estimates.  The fair value for the warrant arrangements has been estimated by management based on various assumptions in a lattice model and are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date.  The Company classifies the estimates used to fair value these instruments as Level 3 inputs. See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements” for a full discussion on fair value measurements.

 3. Revenue Recognition
 
On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all the related amendments and applied it to all contracts that were not completed as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment of less than $0.1 million to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
 
The adoption of this guidance has led to recognizing certain revenue transactions sooner than in the past on certain contracts, as the Company will need to estimate the revenue it will be entitled to upon contract completion, and later on other contracts, such as Consulting and Statement of Work transactions, due to the lack of an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations satisfied over time, specifically in the technology product line. The Company does not expect a material impact to its consolidated statements of operations on an ongoing basis from the adoption of the new standard.
 
In addition, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Non-financial Assets (Subtopic 610-20), in February 2017, to amend ASC 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Non-financial Assets (issued at the same time as ASC 606), which provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of non-financial assets, such as property and equipment, including real estate. As a result of adopting ASU 2017-05 on April 1, 2018, the Company recognized an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit for the deferred gain from the March 28, 2018 sale of the Company's former headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts in the amount of $0.1 million.
 
The cumulative effect to the Company’s consolidated April 1, 2018 balance sheet from the adoption of the new revenue standard and the sale of nonfinancial assets was as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 | March 31, 2018 | | | Opening Adjustment | | | April 1, 2018
------------------------------------------+----------------+----------+---+---------------------+---+--------+--------------
Assets: | | | | | | | | | | 
Accounts Receivable | $ | 7,365 | | | $ | (678 | ) | $ | 6,687 | 
Inventory | | 19,780 | | | | (1,599 | ) | | 18,181 | 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets | | 2,947 | | | | 2,277 | | | 5,224 | 
Notes receivable, long term portion | | 2,559 | | | | 105 | | | 2,664 | 
Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity: | | | | | | | | | | 
Accounts payable and accrued expenses | $ | (12,625 | ) | | $ | (2,729 | ) | $ | (15,354 | )
Deferred revenue | | (13,483 | ) | | | 2,657 | | | (10,826 | )
Accumulated deficit | $ | (988,333 | ) | | $ | (33 | ) | $ | (988,366 | )



Included in the opening adjustment are reclassifications for accounts receivable, deferred program costs and deferred revenue for previous balances related to agreements that no longer meet the definition of a customer contract under ASC 606. The impact of adoption on the Company’s opening balances and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, in all financial statement line items impacted by ASC 606 was immaterial from the amount that would have been reported under the previous guidance.
 
The Company’s revenues in its Grid segment are derived primarily through enabling the transmission and distribution of power, providing planning services that allow it to identify power grid needs and risks, and developing ship protection systems for the U.S. Navy. The Company’s revenues in its Wind segment are derived primarily through supplying advanced power electronics and control systems, licensing its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and providing extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company records revenue based on a five-step model in accordance with ASC 606. For its customer contracts, the Company identifies the performance obligations, determines the transaction price, allocates the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizes the revenue when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. As of March 31, 2019, 85% of revenue was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time.
 
In the Company's equipment and system product line, each contract with a customer summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company’s product sales transfer control to the customer in line with the contracted delivery terms and revenue is recorded at the point in time when title and risk transfer to the customer, as the Company has determined that this is the point in time that control transfers to the customer.

In the Company's service and technology development product line, there are several different types of transactions and each begins with a contract with a customer that summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. The technology development transactions are primarily for activities that have no alternative use and for which a profit can be expected throughout the life of the contract. In these cases, the revenue is recognized over time, but in the instances where the profit cannot be assured throughout the entire contract then the revenue is recognized at a point in time. Each contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach. The ongoing service transactions are for service contracts that provide benefit to the customer simultaneously as the Company performs its obligations, and therefore this revenue is recognized ratably over time throughout the effective period of these contracts. The transaction prices on these contracts are allocated based on an adjusted market approach which is re-assessed annually for reasonableness. The field service transactions include contracts for delivery of goods and completion of services made at the customer's requests, which are not deemed satisfied until the work has been completed and/or the requested goods have been delivered, so all of this revenue is recognized at the point in time when the control changes, and at allocated prices based on the adjusted market approach driven by standard price lists. The royalty transactions are related to certain contract terms on transactions in the Company's equipment and systems product line based on activity as specified in the contracts. The transaction prices of these agreements are calculated based on an adjusted market approach as specified in the contract. The Company reports royalty revenue for usage-based royalties when the sales have occurred. In circumstances when collectability is not assured and a contract does not exist under ASC 606, revenue is deferred until a non-refundable payment has been received for substantially all the amount that is due and there are no further remaining performance obligations.
 
The Company's service contracts can include a purchase order from a customer for specific goods in which each item is a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time at which control of the goods is transferred to the customer which occurs based on the contracted delivery terms or when the requested service work has been completed. The transaction price for these goods is allocated based on the adjusted market approach considering similar transactions under similar circumstances. Service contracts are also derived from ongoing maintenance contracts and extended service-type warranty contracts. In these transactions, the Company is contracted to provide an ongoing service over a specified period of time. As the customer is consuming the benefits as the service is being provided the revenue is recognized over time ratably.
 
The Company’s policy is to not accept volume discounts, product returns, or rebates and allowances within its contracts. In the event a contract was approved with any of these terms, it would be evaluated for variable consideration, estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related product revenue was recorded.
 
The Company provides assurance-type warranties on all product sales for a term of typically one to two years, and extended service-type warranties at the customers’ option for an additional term ranging up to four additional years. The Company accrues for the estimated warranty costs for assurance warranties at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure. For all extended service-type warranties, the Company recognizes the revenue ratably over time during the effective period of the services.
 
The Company records revenue net of sales tax, value added tax, excise tax and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over the products sold passes to customers and revenue is recognized. The Company has elected to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred except in contracts where the amortization period would exceed twelve months; in such cases the long term amount will be assessed for materiality. The Company has elected to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the period of financing is twelve months or less.
 
The Company’s contracts with customers do not typically include extended payment terms and may include milestone billing over the life of the contract. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from delivery.
 
The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by product line and by shipment destination:

In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, 74% and 64% of the Company’s revenues, respectively, were recognized from sales outside the United States. The Company maintains operations in Austria, Romania, and the United States and sales and service support centers around the world.
 
As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances. Changes in the Company’s contract assets, which are included in “Unbilled Accounts Receivable” and “Deferred program costs” (see Note 6, “Accounts Receivable” and Note 7, “Inventory” for a reconciliation to the condensed consolidated balance sheet) and contract liabilities, which are included in the current portion and long term portion of “deferred revenue” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, are as follows:
 
 
 | Unbilled AR | | | Deferred Program Costs | | | Contract Liabilities 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+---------+---+-------------------------+---+--------+----------------------
Beginning balance as of March 31, 2018 | $ | 3,016 | | | $ | 2,567 | | $ | 21,937 | 
Impact of adoption of ASC 606 | | — | | | | (1,599 | ) | | (2,657 | )
Increases for costs incurred to fulfill performance obligations | | — | | | | 1,585 | | | — | 
Increase (decrease) due to customer billings | | (12,076 | ) | | | — | | | 20,540 | 
Decrease due to cost recognition on completed performance obligations | | — | | | | (2,212 | ) | | — | 
Increase (decrease) due to recognition of revenue based on transfer of control of performance obligations | | 11,324 | | | | (9 | ) | | (23,084 | )
Other changes and FX impact | | (51 | ) | | | (14 | ) | | (1,215 | )
Ending balance as of March 31, 2019 | $ | 2,213 | | | $ | 318 | | $ | 15,521 | 



The Company’s remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of the Company’s contractual commitments. The Company’s performance obligations may vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of major new contractual commitments. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding performance obligations on existing contracts under ASC 606 to be recognized in the next twelve months of approximately $47.5 million. There are also approximately $11.6 million of outstanding performance obligations to be recognized over a period of thirteen to sixty months. The remaining performance obligations are subject to customer actions and therefore the timing of revenue recognition cannot be reasonably estimated. The twelve month performance obligations include anticipated shipments to Inox based on the twelve month rolling forecast provided by Inox on the multi-year supply contract. The quantities specified in any forecast provided by Inox related to the multi-year supply contract are firm and irrevocable for the first three months of a twelve month rolling forecast. The timing of the performance obligations beyond the Inox-provided twelve month forecast are not determinable and therefore are not included in the total remaining performance obligations.
 
The following table sets forth customers who represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018:
 

 
 | | Year Ended
------------------+------------+-----------
 | Reportable | March 31, 
 | Segment | 2019 | 2018
Inox Wind Limited | Wind | 34% | 27% 
Vestas | Grid | 15% | <10%

4. Acquisition and Related Goodwill
 
Acquisition of Infinia Technology Corporation
 
On September 25, 2017, the Company acquired Infinia Technology Corporation ("ITC") for approximately $3.8 million (the “Acquisition”). Located in Richmond, Washington, ITC is a technology firm founded in 2009 specializing in the design, development and commercialization of cryo-coolers for a wide range of applications. This technology supports the Company's efforts with the U.S. Navy and ship protection systems (“SPS”) products.
 
The following table summarizes the consideration paid for ITC and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date (in millions):
 
 
 | September 25, 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------
Consideration | | 
Cash | $ | 0.1
Equity (884,890 shares of common stock at $4.02 per share) | | 3.6
Contingent consideration | | 0.6
Total Consideration | $ | 4.3
Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed | | 
Core technology and know-how | $ | 3.4
Working capital | | 0.2
Property, plant and equipment | | 0.0
Total identifiable net assets | $ | 3.6
Long-term deferred tax liability | | 1.1
Goodwill recognized | $ | 1.7



The results of ITC's operations, which were not significant from the date of the Acquisition, September 25, 2017, through March 31, 2019, are included in the Company’s consolidated results. Assuming the Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2017, the impact on the consolidated results of the Company would not have been significant.
 
Goodwill
 
At the time of the Acquisition, the Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of Acquisition. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired of $1.7 million has been recorded as goodwill in the Company's Grid segment. Goodwill represents the value associated with the acquired workforce and synergies related to the merger of the two companies.
 
The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on February 28, 2019 and noted no triggering events from the analysis date to March 31, 2019 and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill.  Additionally, no impairment resulted from the assessment performed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

 5. Fair Value Measurements
 
A valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value has been established. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:

Level 1 | - | Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
--------+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 | - | Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).
Level 3 | - | Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including its own data. 

 
The Company provides a gross presentation of activity within Level 3 measurement roll-forward and details of transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements.  A change in the hierarchy of an investment from its current level is reflected in the period during which the pricing methodology of such investment changes.  Disclosure of the transfer of securities from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 is made in the event that the related security is significant to total cash and investments.  The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities from Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended March 31, 2019.
 
A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis, measured as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
 
 
 | Total Carrying Value | | Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) | | | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | | Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)

Valuation Techniques
 
Cash Equivalents
 
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.
Warrants
 
Warrants were issued in conjunction with a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Capital Ventures International (“CVI”), an equity offering to Hudson Bay Capital in November 2014, and a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”). The warrants issued to CVI expired on October 4, 2017. See Note 12 “Warrants and Derivative Liabilities,” for additional information. Outstanding warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value will be recorded as a change in fair value in derivatives and warrants until the earlier of their exercise or expiration.
 
The Company relies on various assumptions in a lattice model to determine the fair value of warrants. The Company has valued the warrants within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. See Note 12, “Warrants and Derivative Liabilities,” for a discussion of the warrants and the valuation assumptions used.

 8. Note Receivable
 
AMSC entered into a purchase and sale agreement dated February 1, 2018 for the Devens facility (including land, building and building improvements) located at 64 Jackson Road, Devens, Massachusetts to 64 Jackson Road, LLC, a limited liability company, in the amount of $23.0 million. The terms for payment included a $1.0 million security deposit, and a note receivable for $6.0 million payable to AMSC with the remaining cash net of certain adjustments for closing costs at the date of settlement.
 
The note receivable is due in two $3.0 million installments plus accrued interest at 1.96% rate.  The first installment was paid on March 28, 2019 and the second installment was paid May 23, 2019. The note was subordinate to East Boston Savings Bank's mortgage on the Devens property. The note receivable was discounted to its present value of $5.7 million utilizing a discount rate of 6%, which was based on management’s assessment of what an appropriate loan at current market rate would be. The $0.3 million discount was recorded as an offset to the long term portion of the note receivable.  As of March 31, 2019, the remaining $0.1 million discount is being amortized to interest income as an offset to the short term portion of the note, over the remaining term of the note.
 
In addition, the resulting gain of $0.1 million from the sale of the Devens property which was deferred previously was recorded as a component of the cumulative effect of an accounting change upon the adoption of ASU 2017-05 which was issued as a part of ASU 2014-09. This gain was recorded as an offset to the opening accumulated deficit.
 
Note receivable as of March 31, 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):

12. Warrants and Derivative Liabilities
 
The Company accounts for its warrants and contingent consideration as liabilities due to certain adjustment provisions within the instruments, which require that they be recorded at fair value. The warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value of warrants until the earlier of its expiration or its exercise at which time the warrant liability will be reclassified to equity. The Company calculated the fair value of the warrants utilizing an integrated lattice model. See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion.
Hercules Warrant
 
The Company issued Hercules warrants to purchase 13,927 shares of common stock (the “First Warrant”) and 25,641 shares of common stock (the “Second Warrant”) in conjunction with prior term loans that have been repaid in full. On December 19, 2014, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules (the "Hercules Second Amendment"). In conjunction with the Hercules Second Amendment, the Company issued Hercules a warrant to purchase 58,823 shares of the Company’s common stock (the "Hercules Warrant") which replaced the First Warrant and the Second Warrant.  The Hercules Warrant is exercisable at any time after its issuance at an exercise price of $7.85 per share, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments, including the equity offering in May 2017, the acquisition of ITC with common stock in September 2017 and sales of common stock under the ATM entered into in January 2017, and expires on June 30, 2020.  This warrant had a fair value of $0.4 million as of March 31, 2019 and $0.1 million as of March 31, 2018.  On April 8, 2019 Hercules notified the Company of its intent to exercise this warrant on a cashless basis.  Hercules received 22,821 shares of the Company's common stock on April 17, 2019.

November 2014 Warrant
 
On November 13, 2014, the Company completed an offering of 909,090 units of the Company’s common stock with Hudson Bay Capital. Each unit consisted of one share of the Company’s common stock and 0.9 of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock, or a warrant to purchase in the aggregate 818,181 shares (the “November 2014 Warrant”).  The November 2014 Warrant is exercisable at any time, at an exercise price equal to $7.81 per share, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments including those noted above, and expires on November 13, 2019.

Contingent Consideration
 
The Company evaluated the ITC acquisition Make Whole Payment set forth in the SPA, which ultimately required net settlement cash, and determined the contingent consideration qualified for liability classification and derivative treatment under ASC 815. As a result, for each period the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured and the resulting gain or loss was recognized in operating expenses.
 
Following is a summary of the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the ITC acquisition:
 
 
Fiscal Year 2017 | September 30, 2017 | September 25, 2017 
-------------------------------+---------------------+--------------------
Risk-free interest rate | 1.09% | 1.09% 
Expected annual dividend yield | — | — 
Expected volatility | 66.54% | 65.71% 
Term (years) | 0.31 | 0.32 
Fair value | $0.4 million | $0.6 million 

 

All of the stock related to this liability was sold as of December 5, 2017 and the amount of the Make Whole Payment was calculated to be $0.7 million, and subsequently paid on January 5, 2018. As such, no fair value estimate using a Black-Scholes model was needed as the liability was recorded at the known settlement value for the period ending December 31, 2017. The Company recorded a net loss of $0.1 million resulting from an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform Act"), that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changed the U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system, expanding the tax base, imposing a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxing certain foreign earnings to the U.S. through global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), modifying officer's compensation deduction limitations and creating new limitations on deductible interest expense. The Company recognized the impact of the Tax Reform Act in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), the Company had a measurement period up to one year beginning December 22, 2017 to obtain, analyze and prepare the information needed to complete the accounting requirements of the Tax Reform Act. The Company completed the analysis allowed under SAB 118 when it finalized the deemed repatriation tax computation in conjunction with the filing of the Company's 2017 federal and state tax returns and the final impact did not result in any material change from the original estimate.
 
The Company has elected to recognize the income tax related to GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred or expected to occur for the year ended March 31, 2019. The inclusion of GILTI had no impact on the Company's income tax expense or effective tax rate in the period due to the full valuation allowance applied to the U.S. entity.

The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets in the U.S. and China since it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realizable. After consideration of all the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a $196.5 million valuation allowance at March 31, 2019 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
 
At March 31, 2019, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $776.0 million and $198.0 million, respectively, which expire in the years ending March 31, 2019 through 2039. For U.S. federal tax purpose, approximately $30.0 million of Federal net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period. Included in the U.S. net operating loss are $3.7 million of acquired losses from Power Quality Systems, Inc. and $0.3 million of acquired losses from Infinia Technology Corporation. Research and development and other tax credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $10.1 million and $3.5 million are available to offset federal and state income taxes, respectively, and will expire in the years ending March 31, 2019 through 2039.
 
At March 31, 2019, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for its Chinese operation of approximately $21.8 million, which can be carried forward for five years and begin to expire December 31, 2019. 
 
Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”), provides limits on the extent to which a corporation that has undergone an ownership change (as defined) can utilize any net operating loss ("NOL") and general business tax credit carryforwards it may have. The Company updated its study through June 15, 2017 as a result of the May 2017 equity offering to determine whether Section 382 could limit the use of its carryforwards in this manner. After completing this study, the Company has concluded that the limitation will not have a material impact on its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.  If there were material ownership changes subsequent to the study, such changes could limit the Company's ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards. The Company increased its NOL’s by $0.3 million due to acquired losses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from ITC. The Company conducted a study on the acquired NOL and concluded that the limitations under Section 382 will not have a material impact on its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.
 
The total amount of undistributed foreign earnings available to be repatriated at March 31, 2019 was $30.0 million resulting in the recording of a $1.7 million deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes.
 
The Company has not recorded a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference associated with the excess of the tax greater than the book basis in its Chinese subsidiary as the future tax benefit is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
 
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.  The Company did not identify any uncertain tax positions at March 31, 2019.  The Company did not have any gross unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2019 or 2018.
 
There were no reversals of uncertain tax positions in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for federal and state income taxes. Any unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably affect its effective tax rate in any future period. The Company does not expect that the amounts of unrecognized benefits will change significantly within the next twelve months.
 
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Major tax jurisdictions include the U.S., China, Romania and Austria. All U.S. income tax filings for fiscal years ended March 31, 1996 through 2019 remain open and subject to examination.
 
All fiscal years from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 through 2019 remain open and subject to examination in Austria.  The Company’s tax filings in China for calendar years 2013 and 2014 were examined with no material exceptions.   As of March 31, 2019, the Company remains open to audit for the calendar years 2016 and forward in China.  Tax filings in Romania for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 through 2019 remain open and subject to examination.

 15. Commitments and Contingencies
 
Purchase Commitments
 
The Company periodically enters into non-cancelable purchase contracts in order to ensure the availability of materials to support production of its products. Purchase commitments represent enforceable and legally binding agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services. The Company periodically assesses the need to provide for impairment on these purchase contracts and record a loss on purchase commitments when required.
Lease Commitments
 
Operating leases include minimum payments under leases for the Company’s facilities and certain equipment. The Company’s primary leased facilities are located in Klagenfurt, Austria; Suzhou, China; Ayer, Massachusetts; Timisoara, Romania; and Pewaukee, Wisconsin; with a combined total of approximately 187,000 square feet of space. These leases have varying expiration dates through November 2022 which can generally be terminated at the Company’s request after a six month advance notice. The Company leases other locations which focus primarily on applications engineering, sales and/or field service and do not have significant leases or physical presence.  See Item 2, “Properties” for further information.
 
Minimum future lease commitments at March 31, 2019 were as follows (in thousands):

-------------+------------------------------+------
 | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Rent expense | $ | 1,286 | | $ | 1,510

Legal Contingencies
 
From time to time, the Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements not misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial statements.
Other
 
The Company enters into long-term construction contracts with customers that require the Company to obtain performance bonds. The Company is required to deposit an amount equivalent to some or all the face amount of the performance bonds into an escrow account until the termination of the bond. When the performance conditions are met, amounts deposited as collateral for the performance bonds are returned to the Company. In addition, the Company has various contractual arrangements in which minimum quantities of goods or services have been committed to be purchased on an annual basis.
 
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $0.7 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets. These amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent deposits to secure letters of credit for various supply contracts. These deposits are held in interest bearing accounts.

 16. Employee Benefit Plans
 
The Company has implemented a defined contribution plan (the “Plan”) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Any contributions made by the Company to the Plan are discretionary. The Company has a stock match program under which the Company matched, in the form of Company common stock, 50% of the first 6% of eligible contributions. The Company recorded expense of $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and recorded corresponding charges to additional paid-in capital related to this program.
17. Restructuring
 
The Company accounts for charges resulting from operational restructuring actions in accordance with ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”) and ASC Topic 712, Compensation—Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits (“ASC 712”). In accounting for these obligations, the Company is required to make assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance, benefits, and related costs and the time period over which leased facilities will remain vacant, sublease terms, sublease rates and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation arises. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate; changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount accrued on the consolidated balance sheet.
 
The $0.5 million charged to operations in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was related to exit costs incurred primarily during the first half of fiscal 2018 for the move of the Company's corporate office.
 
On April 3, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a plan to reduce the Company’s global workforce by approximately 8%, effective April 4, 2017. The purpose of the workforce reduction was to reduce operating expenses to better align with the Company’s current revenues. Included in the $1.3 million severance pay, charged to operations in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, is $0.5 million of severance pay for one of the Company's former executive officers pursuant to the terms of a severance agreement dated June 30, 2017. Under the terms of the severance agreement, the Company's former executive officer was entitled to 18 months of his base salary, and received his final severance payment in December 2018.
 
The following table presents restructuring charges and cash payments during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

 18. Business Segments
 
The Company reports its financial results in two reportable business segments: Grid and Wind.
 
Through the Company’s power grid offerings, the Grid business segment enables electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power through our transmission planning services, power electronics, and superconductor-based systems. The sales process is enabled by transmission planning services that allow it to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality and other risks, which helps the Company determine how its solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems, and transmission and distribution cable systems.  The Company also sells ship protection products to the U.S. Navy through its Grid business segment.
 
Through the Company’s wind power offerings, the Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through our advanced power electronics and control system products, engineered designs, and support services. The Company supplies advanced power electronics and control systems, licenses its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provides extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company’s design portfolio includes a broad range of drive trains and power ratings of 2 megawatts ("MWs") and higher. The Company provides a broad range of power electronics and software-based control systems that are highly integrated and designed for optimized performance, efficiency, and grid compatibility.

The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. The Company’s business segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measures are segment revenues and segment operating income (loss). The disaggregated financial results of the segments reflect allocation of certain functional expense categories consistent with the basis and manner in which Company management internally disaggregates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions. In addition, certain corporate expenses which the Company does not believe are specifically attributable or allocable to either of the two business segments have been excluded from the segment operating loss.

Unallocated corporate expenses primarily consist of stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million and $2.7 million, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, restructuring charges of $0.5 million and $1.5 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and a change in the fair value of contingent consideration of $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

 19. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") issued, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance substantially converges final standards on revenue recognition between the FASB and IASB providing a framework on addressing revenue recognition issues and, upon its effective date, replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The FASB has subsequently issued multiple amendments to ASU 2014-09 which are all effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
 
As of April 1, 2018, the Company has adopted ASU 2014-09 and its amendments, reported the impact in its consolidated financial statements, and implemented changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition and the related disclosures under this ASU. The Company’s assessment included a detailed review of representative contracts from each of the Company’s revenue streams and a comparison of its historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard. The Company adopted the new standards retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective transition method) to all existing contracts that have remaining obligations as of April 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company has elected to retroactively adjust only those contracts that do not meet the definition of a complete contract at the date of the initial application. This guidance has led to recognizing certain revenue transactions sooner than in the past on certain contracts, as the Company will need to estimate the revenue it will be entitled to upon contract completion, and later on other contracts, such as Consulting and Statement of Work transactions, due to the lack of an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations satisfied over time. There were no changes in the accounting for its largest revenue stream which includes Inox Wind as its primary customer. Across other revenue streams such as D-VAR® Equipment and D-VAR® turnkey projects, the timing of revenue recognition will be affected for multiple types of contracts, primarily multiple performance obligation contracts in its Grid business unit, but those differences did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The adjustment to opening accumulated deficit was not significant in the period commencing on April 1, 2018. Additionally, the adoption of this new standard did not have any tax impact on the consolidated financial statements. As part of this analysis, the Company evaluated its information technology capabilities and systems, and did not incur significant information technology costs to modify systems currently in place.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendments in ASU 2016-01 will enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 effective April 1, 2018 and noted no significant impact to its consolidated financial statements.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This ASU and its amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
 

• | In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification improvements to Topic 842, Leases. The amendments in ASU 2018-10 provide more clarification in regards to the application and requirements of ASU 2016-02.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Topic 842, Leases - Targeted improvements. The amendments in ASU 2018-11 provide for the option to adopt the standard prospectively and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as well as offer a new practical expedient that will allow the Company to elect, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease and lease components in certain circumstances and instead to account for those components as a single item.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has evaluated the provisions of ASU 2016-02 and its amendments, and assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures. This process has included identifying the implementation team, applying the revised definition of a lease per ASC 842 to existing agreements, and from that information, creating an initial population. The Company made the policy election to exclude all leases shorter than 12 months from the recognition of the recording of the right of use ("ROU") asset and related liabilities. The Company elected the package of three practical expedients in regards to all leases that commenced before the effective date. The Company made a policy election to not separate non-lease and lease components for all asset classes. The adoption of this guidance will result in certain changes to the financial statements to add the related asset and liability accounts for all of its operating leases. The Company will continue to assess its agreements for any other impacts that may result from the adoption of this standard. Based on the analysis of the initial lease population, the Company has determined that its initial population will be made up entirely of operating leases.  The Company has prepared control wording, is finalizing the overall lease policies and has identified and implemented any changes that were necessary to comply with the provisions of ASU 2016-02.

ASU 2016-02 became effective on April 1, 2019, and the Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective transition method, which impacts all leases existing at, or entered into after, the period of adoption. For all leases existing at the time of adoption the Company will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings as of April 1, 2019. As a result of the adoption of ASC 842, the Company expects to recognize an increase in net lease assets between $3.0 million and $5.0 million and an increase in net lease liabilities between $3.0 million and $5.0 million related to the recognition of a right-of-use asset and the associated liability.
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 will provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In 2016, the FASB issued the following two ASU's on Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). Both amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
 

• | In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 provide more guidance towards the classification of multiple different types of cash flows in order to reduce the diversity in reporting across entities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 effective April 1, 2018 and the consolidated statement of cash flow has been prepared to conform with ASU 2016-18 for all periods presented.
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 will improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.  The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 effective April 1, 2018 and noted no significant impact to its consolidated financial statements.
 
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Non-financial Assets (Subtopic 610-20). The amendments in ASU 2017-05 clarify the scope of Subtopic 610-20, Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Non-financial Assets, and add guidance for partial sales of non-financial assets. Subtopic 610-20, which was issued in May 2014 as a part of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), provides guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of non-financial assets in contracts with non-customers.  The Company adopted ASU 2017-05 effective April 1, 2018 and adjusted the opening balance of accumulated deficit by $0.1 million for recognition of the deferred gain on the sale of the 64 Jackson Road building that occurred on March 28, 2018.
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718) Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide clarity and reduce both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company adopted ASU 2017-09 effective April 1, 2018 and noted no significant impact to its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in ASU 2017-11 provide guidance for freestanding equity-linked financial instruments, such as warrants and conversion options in convertible debt or preferred stock, and should no longer be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-11 and does not expect a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements, primarily due to the put option feature within the Company's warrant agreements which requires continued liability classification under ASC 480.
 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments in ASU 2017-12 provide improved financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. In addition, the amendments in this update make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2017-12 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-Employee Share Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in ASU 2018-07 provide for the simplification of the measurement of share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 effective April 1, 2018 and noted no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 provide for increased effectiveness of the disclosures made around fair value measurements while including consideration for costs and benefits. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods.
