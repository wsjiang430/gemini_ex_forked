Our History
The following graphic depicts the Company’s history and key events that have occurred since the Company’s formation.

December 31, 2018 | 7

Petroleum
Our Petroleum Segment is comprised of the assets and operations of CVR Refining, including two refineries located in Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma and supporting logistics assets in the region. 
Facilities
Coffeyville Refinery - We own a complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in southeast Kansas, approximately 100 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma (“Cushing”) with a name plate crude oil capacity of 132,000 bpd (the “Coffeyville Refinery”). The major operations of the Coffeyville Refinery include fractionation, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, reforming, coking, isomerization, alkylation, sulfur recovery and propane and butane recovery operating units. The Coffeyville Refinery benefits from significant refining unit redundancies, which include two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers, three sulfur recovery units and four hydrotreating units. These redundancies allow the Coffeyville Refinery to continue to receive and process crude oil even if one tower requires maintenance without having to shut down the entire refinery. In addition, the Coffeyville Refinery has a redundant supply of hydrogen pursuant to its feedstock and shared services agreement with a subsidiary of CVR Partners. 
Wynnewood Refinery - We own a complex crude oil refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma approximately 65 miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and approximately 130 miles from Cushing with a name plate crude oil capacity of 74,500 bpd capable of processing 20,000 bpd of light sour crude oil (the “Wynnewood Refinery” and together with the Coffeyville Refinery, the “Refineries”). The major operations of the Wynnewood Refinery include fractionation, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, reforming, solvent deasphalting, alkylation, sulfur recovery and propane and butane recovery operating units. Similar to the Coffeyville Refinery, the Wynnewood Refinery benefits from unit redundancies, including two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers and four hydrotreating units.

Supply
_____________________________
The “Jayhawk” third-party crude oil pipeline, depicted in the graphic above and to the left, is in the process of being disconnected from CVR Refining’s pipeline network and will no longer be utilized going forward. This is not expected to have a significant impact on operations or the financial performance of CVR Refining.
The Coffeyville Refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from heavy sour to light sweet crude oil. Currently, the Coffeyville Refinery crude oil slate consists of a blend of mid-continent domestic grades and various Canadian medium and heavy sours and other similarly sourced crudes. Other blendstocks include normal butane, natural gasoline, alkylation feeds, naphtha, gas oil and vacuum tower bottoms. The Wynnewood Refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from medium sour to light sweet crude oil. Isobutane, gasoline components, and normal butane blendstocks are also typically used. 

December 31, 2018 | 10

In addition to the use of third-party pipelines, we have an extensive gathering system consisting of logistics assets that are owned, leased or part of a joint venture operation. These assets include the following:

 | | As of December 31, 2018
 | Pipeline Segment | Length (miles) | Capacity (bpd)
Joint Ventures: | | 
 | Midway (1) | 100 | 120,000

_____________________________

(1) | CVR Refining participates in the ownership of these pipelines through equity method investments. Refer to Item 8, Note 4 (“Equity Method Investments”) for further discussion of these investments.


(2) | Velocity refers to the pipeline owned by our joint venture with Velocity Pipeline Partners, LLC (“VPP”), which was acquired by Enable Midstream Partners, LP. The capacity of the Enable line is being expanded to 115,000 bpd with an estimated completion date of February 2019.


(3) | In support of our Coffeyville Refinery, we own and operate a tank storage facility in close proximity to the Coffeyville Refinery (the “East Tank Farm”).

For the acquisition of crude oil within close proximity of the Refineries, we operate a fleet of approximately 140 trucks and have contracts with third-party trucking fleets to acquire and deliver crude oil to our pipeline system or directly to the Refineries for consumption or resale. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the gathering system, which includes the pipelines outlined above and our trucking operations, supplied approximately 40% and 89% of the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries’ crude oil demand, respectively. Regionally-sourced crude oils delivered to the Refineries usually have a transportation cost advantage compared to other domestic or international crudes given the Refineries’ proximity to the producing areas. However, sometimes slightly heavier and more sour crudes may offer good economics to the Refineries, including the higher cost of transportation. The regionally-sourced crude oils we purchase are light and sweet enough to allow the Refineries to blend higher percentages of lower cost crude oils, such as heavy Canadian sour, to optimize economics within operational constraints.
Crude oils sourced outside of our gathering system are delivered to Cushing by various third-party pipelines, including the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines where we can be subject to proration, and subsequently to the Broome Station facility via the Midway joint venture pipeline. Our current contracted capacity includes the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, respectively. From the Broome Station facility, crude oil is delivered to the Coffeyville refinery via the Refining Partnership’s 170,000 bpd proprietary pipeline system. Crude oils are delivered to the Wynnewood Refinery through third-party and joint venture pipelines, and received into storage tanks at terminals located on or near the refinery.
We also own storage tanks with total storage capacity of 3.8 million barrels, including 1.5 million barrels of tank storage in Cushing. Additionally, we lease tank storage totaling 2.5 million barrels, including 2.3 million barrels at Cushing. 

December 31, 2018 | 11

The Coffeyville Refinery is connected to the mid-continent natural gas liquid commercial hub at Conway, Kansas by the inbound Enterprise Pipeline Blue Line. Natural gas liquid blendstocks such as butanes and natural gasoline are sourced and delivered directly into the refinery. In addition, Coffeyville Refinery’s proximity to Conway provides access to the natural gas liquid and liquid petroleum gas fractionation and storage capabilities.
Through the crude oil and other feedstock supply operations outlined above, and the associated markets available to it, we are able to source and refine crude oils from different locations and of different compositions when it is economically advantageous to do so. To capture favorable market differentials (including transportation costs) and produce higher value products, our throughput has shifted toward more regional and lighter crude oils in 2018 compared to 2017, as illustrated in the tables below.

 | Year Ended December 31, 2018

Marketing and Distribution
Our Coffeyville product marketing efforts are focused in the central mid-continent area through rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks and railcars directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to the refinery and to customers at terminals on third-party refined products distribution systems; and bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing third-party product pipeline networks. 
The Wynnewood Refinery ships its finished product via pipeline, railcar, and truck, focusing its efforts in Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas as well as eastern Missouri. The pipeline system is capable of multi-directional flow, providing access to Texas markets as well as adjoining states with pipeline connections. The Wynnewood Refinery also sells jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense via its segregated truck rack.
Customers
Customers for the Refineries’ petroleum products primarily include retailers, railroads, and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the Refineries and pipeline access. We typically sell bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service (“OPIS”).
Rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by the competitive forces in the Group 3 market. In addition, the Coffeyville Refinery sells hydrogen and by-products of its refining operations, such as petroleum coke, to an affiliate, CVR Partners, pursuant to multi-year agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, only one customer accounted for 10% or more of the Refining Partnership’s consolidated revenues. 
December 31, 2018 | 13

Competition
Our Petroleum Segment competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of the Refineries provides us with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over our competitors. We primarily compete against five refineries in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, we compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast, the Great Lakes and the Texas panhandle region. 
Seasonality
Our Petroleum Segment operations experience seasonal fluctuations as demand for gasoline products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Demand for diesel fuel is higher during the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, its results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower compared to its results for the second and third calendar quarters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which we sell petroleum products can impact the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. 
Nitrogen Fertilizer
Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment is comprised of the assets and operations of CVR Partners, including two nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois.
Facilities
Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility - We own and operate a nitrogen fertilizer production facility in Coffeyville, Kansas that includes a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, a 1,300 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 3,000 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit (the “Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility”). The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility is the only nitrogen fertilizer plant in North America that utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility’s largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is pet coke, which it purchases from our Coffeyville Refinery and third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility purchased approximately $13 million, $8 million and $8 million, respectively, of pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of $28, $17 and $15, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we upgraded approximately 93%, 88% and 93%, respectively, of our ammonia production into UAN, a product that presently generates greater profit than ammonia and will continue to do so when the economics are favorable. 
East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility - We own and operate a nitrogen fertilizer production facility in East Dubuque, Illinois that includes a 1,075 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit (the “East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility”). The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility has the flexibility to vary its product mix enabling it upgrade a portion of ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company. The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility’s largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is natural gas, which it purchases from third parties. The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility’s natural gas process results in a higher percentage of variable costs as compared to the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, and 2017 the East Dubuque Facility incurred approximately $22 million and $26 million for feedstock natural gas, respectively, which equaled an average cost of $3.15 and $3.26 per MMBtu, respectively.
Commodities
The nitrogen products we produce are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for its products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of its products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand.
December 31, 2018 | 14

Agriculture 
The three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the United States of America are ammonia, urea and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.
Nutrients are depleted in soil over time and therefore must be replenished through fertilizer use. Nitrogen is the most quickly depleted nutrient and must be replenished every year, whereas phosphate and potassium can be retained in soil for up to three years. Plants require nitrogen in the largest amounts and it accounts for approximately 57% of primary fertilizer consumption on a nutrient ton basis, per the International Fertilizer Industry Association (“IFIA”).
Demand
Global demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by grain demand and prices, which, in turn, are driven by population growth, farmland per capita, dietary changes in the developing world and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the IFIA, from 1974 to 2016, global fertilizer demand grew 2% annually. Global fertilizer use, consisting of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium, is projected to increase by 34% between 2010 and 2030 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. In addition, populations in developing countries are shifting to more protein-rich diets as their incomes increase, with such consumption requiring more grain for animal feed. As an example, China’s wheat and coarse grains production is estimated to have increased 32% between 2007 and 2018, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its wheat and coarse grain imports by more than 1,320% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
The United States is the world’s largest exporter of coarse grains, accounting for 33% of world exports and 29% of world production for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, according to the USDA. A substantial amount of nitrogen is consumed in production of these crops to increase yield. Based on Fertecon Limiteds (“Fertecon”) 2018 estimates, the United States is the world’s third largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and the world’s largest importer of nitrogen fertilizer. Fertecon is a reputable agency which provides market information and analysis on fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials for fertilizer and related industries, and international agencies. Fertecon estimates indicate that the United States represented 12% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption for 2018, with China and India as the top consumers representing 23% and 15% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption, respectively. 
North American nitrogen fertilizer producers predominantly use natural gas as their primary feedstock. Over the last five years, U.S. oil and natural gas reserves have increased significantly due to, among other factors, advances in extracting shale oil and gas. More recently, global demand has slowed with production staying steady even as oil and gas prices have declined substantially over the past two years. As a result, North America has become a low-cost region for nitrogen fertilizer production.
Raw Material Supply
Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility - During the past five years, just under 70% (2018 - 59%) of the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility’s pet coke requirements on average were supplied by our adjacent Coffeyville Refinery pursuant to a multi-year agreement. Historically, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements through third parties, such as other mid-continent refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. In 2018, we entered into a term deal with a third-party contracts typically priced at a discounted to the spot market. In 2018, a larger amount of third party purchases were made at spot prices due to less supply being available from the Coffeyville Refinery. Additionally, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility relies on a third-party air separation plant at its location that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility gasifiers. 
East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility - The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. We are typically able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and a third-party pipeline. The pipelines are connected to Nicor Inc.’s distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect from which natural gas is transported to the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase approximately 1.4 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in our East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in January and February 2019 at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately $3.84, exclusive of transportation cost.
December 31, 2018 | 15

Marketing and Distribution
Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment primarily markets UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers. UAN and ammonia accounted for approximately 72% and 20%, respectively, of our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment’s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a free-on-board (“FOB”) shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. We operate a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery, and, if delivered by railcar, the products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis and we typically arrange the freight. 
Nitrogen fertilizer products leave the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific or Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility primarily sells product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility and arrange to transport them to their final destinations by truck. 
Customers
We sell UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, we sell ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Given the nature of the nitrogen fertilizer business, and consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts with customers are for a term of 12-month or less. Some of our industrial sales include long-term purchase contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the top five customers in the aggregate represented 32% of the nitrogen fertilizer segment’s net sales. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment’s top customer accounted for approximately 14% of its net sales. 
Competition
Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has experienced and expects to continue to meet significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. We seasonally adjust inventory to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations.
Our major competitors in the nitrogen fertilizer business include CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.; Koch Fertilizer Company, LLC; and Nutrien Ltd. (formerly known as Agrium, Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.). Domestic competition is intense due to customers’ sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. We also encounter competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments. 
The decline of natural gas prices in recent periods has led to existing and new producers considering construction of new or expanding existing nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in the United States. The substantial majority of the incremental nitrogen fertilizer supply associated with the construction of confirmed new production facilities is expected to be online in 2018. Once the increased production comes on-stream, Blue, Johnson & Associates, Inc., a company management considers to provide reliable fertilizer industry forecasts, expects the United States will still require net imports into the United States to meet domestic demand for nitrogen fertilizers. 
Seasonality
Because the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment primarily sells agricultural commodity products, its business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers’ current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. The nitrogen fertilizer segment typically experiences higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and its net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season. 
December 31, 2018 | 16

Environmental Matters
Our petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline, diesel fuels, UAN and ammonia. These laws and regulations and the enforcement thereof impact the petroleum segment and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer segment and operations by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities and for off-site waste disposal locations; and,


• | specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum segment and the nitrogen fertilizer segment, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia.

Our operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”)
The CAA and its implementing regulations, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations governing air emissions, affect the petroleum segment and the nitrogen fertilizer segment both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts may occur through the CAA’s permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. The CAA affects the petroleum segment and the nitrogen fertilizer segment by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide (“SO2”), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and other substances, including those emitted by mobile sources, which are direct or indirect users of our products. Some or all of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the CAA, or any future promulgations of regulations, may require the installation of controls or changes to the petroleum facilities and/or the nitrogen fertilizer facilities (collectively referred to as the “Facilities”) to maintain compliance. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material.
The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the New Source Performance Standards and the New Source Review. 
The Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”)
The CWA and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the water, affect the petroleum segment and the nitrogen fertilizer segment. The CWA’s permitting requirements establish discharge limitations based on technology standards, water quality standards, and restrictions on the total maximum daily load of pollutants allowed to enter a particular water body based on its use. In addition, water resources are becoming and in the future may become scarcer, and many refiners, including us, are subject to use restrictions in the event of low availability conditions. Our Refineries have contracts in place to receive water during certain water shortage conditions, but these conditions could change over time depending on the scarcity of water.

Release Reporting
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our Facilities periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from their equipment. Our Facilities periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned start-up, shutdown and malfunction events. From time to time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if a release violates the law or our permits, we could become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Fuel Regulations
In April 2014, the EPA promulgated the Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards (“Tier 3”), which require that gasoline contain no more than ten parts per million of sulfur on an annual average basis. The Coffeyville Refinery was required to be in compliance with the more stringent emission standards as of January 2017 and the Wynnewood Refinery’s compliance deadline was December 2018. The Refineries are currently in compliance with the EPA’s Tier 3 Standards.
In 2007, the EPA promulgated the Mobile Source Air Toxic II (“MSAT II”) rule that required refiners to meet a reduced gasoline benzene content standard for gasoline by 2011, with an extended deadline for approved small refiners such as us. The Refineries are in compliance with the EPA’s MSAT II rule.
Renewable Fuel Standards
Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”), the EPA has promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”). The RFS requires refiners to either blend “renewable fuels,” such as ethanol and biofuels, into their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, in lieu of blending. Under the RFS, the volume of renewable fuels that refineries like Coffeyville and Wynnewood are obligated to blend into their finished transportation fuel is adjusted annually by the EPA based on fuel supply and other conditions to meet the statutory mandates that increase annually, but which may be waived by the EPA under certain conditions. The volume of renewable fuels required by EISA increased from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 22 billion gallons in 2016 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. In addition to the total renewable fuel volume mandate, there are sub-mandates for advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel. Under the cellulosic waiver authority provided to the EPA by the Clean Air Act, if the EPA’s projected volume of cellulosic biofuel for a calendar year is less than its statutory mandate, the EPA must reduce the required volume of cellulosic biofuel accordingly and provide obligated parties the opportunity to purchase cellulosic waiver credits. EPA also has the discretion to reduce the total renewable fuel and advanced biofuel requirements by the same amount as it reduced the cellulosic biofuel volume. The petroleum segment (like many refiners) is not able to meet its annual renewable volume obligation through blending, so it has had to purchase RINs on the open market as well as obtain cellulosic waiver credits from the EPA, in order to comply with the RFS. The cost of purchasing RINs and cellulosic waiver credits fluctuates and can be significant. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile as the EPA’s proposed renewable fuel volume mandates approached and exceeded the “blend wall.” The blend wall refers to the point at which the amount of ethanol blended into the transportation fuel supply exceeds the demand for transportation fuel containing such levels of ethanol. The blend wall is generally considered to be reached when more than 10% ethanol by volume (“E10 gasoline”) is blended into transportation fuel.
In December 2018, the EPA published the final renewable fuel volumes for 2019, and the biomass-based diesel volume for 2020. As in past years, the volumes increased from the previous year, but are lower, with the exception of the volume for biomass-based diesel, than the volumes required by the Clean Air Act. EPA used its cellulosic waiver authority to lower the volumes.
Throughout 2018, various groups including the Renewable Fuels Association and Growth Energy brought cases in federal courts to challenge the EPA’s implementation of the RFS program, including the EPA’s decision to grant hardship relief to roughly 25 small refineries for the 2017 compliance year. In November 2018, a biofuel organization, Producers of Renewable United for Integrity Truth and Transparency, asked the D.C. Circuit to “freeze” the waiver program, but the court denied the biofuel organization’s request. The EPA has not yet acted on any small refinery hardship petitions for the 2018 compliance year.
December 31, 2018 | 18

Several RFS-related rulemakings are expected to occur in 2019. One relates to a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) in which several biofuels groups challenged EPA’s final renewable fuels volumes for 2014 through 2016. In July 2017, the D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the 2016 volumes under its “inadequate domestic supply” waiver authority and remanded the rule to the EPA for further reconsideration. The EPA has not yet re-proposed the 2016 renewable volume obligations but might do so in a rulemaking in 2019, which could result in an increase in the volume mandates for 2016 to increase and, as a result, require Coffeyville and Wynnewood to purchase more RINs for 2016 compliance.
Another expected rulemaking involves the “reset” provision of the Clean Air Act. Under the reset provision, if the EPA waives the statutory volumes for any of the four fuel categories by at least 20% for two consecutive years or by at least 50% for a single year, then the EPA must modify the statutory volumes for all subsequent years for that fuel category. The reset has been triggered in previous years for both advanced biofuel and cellulosic biofuel and, most recently, the 2019 final rule triggered the reset provision for total renewable fuel. In October 2018, the EPA reported that it will begin a rulemaking in 2019 to reset the volumes for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for compliance years 2020-2022. During the rulemaking, the EPA may either increase or decrease the volumes, in either case impacting Coffeyville’s and Wynnewood’s obligations under the RFS.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions (“GHG”) 
The EPA regulates GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In October 2009, the EPA finalized a rule requiring certain large emitters of GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions to the EPA. In accordance with the rule, our facilities monitor and report our GHG emissions to the EPA. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the “Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” which established GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources, such as the Refineries and the nitrogen fertilizer facilities, must obtain permits under Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V programs of the federal Clean Air Act. Under the rule, facilities already subject to the PSD and Title V programs that increase their emissions of GHGs by a significant amount are required to undergo PSD review and to evaluate and implement air pollution control technology, known as “best available control technology,” to reduce GHG emissions. 

In December 2010, the EPA reached a settlement agreement with numerous parties under which it agreed to promulgate New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) to regulate GHG emissions from petroleum refineries and electric utilities by November 2012. In September 2014, the EPA indicated that the petroleum refining sector risk rule, proposed in June 2014 to address air toxics and volatile organic compounds from refineries, may make it unnecessary for the EPA to regulate GHG emissions from petroleum refineries at this time. The final rule, which was published in the Federal Register on December 1, 2015, addresses air toxics and volatile organic compounds and places additional emission control requirements and work practice standards on FCCUs, storage tanks, flares, coking units and other equipment at petroleum refineries. Therefore, we do not currently expect that the EPA will be issuing regulations on GHG from petroleum refineries at this time but that it may do so in the future.
In October 2015, EPA promulgated NSPS for carbon dioxide emissions from electric utilities. However, since the change in administration in 2017, EPA has shifted its regulatory approach of GHG emissions. In December 2018, EPA proposed amendments to the 2015 NSPS that, among other things, would replace the determination of the best system of emission reduction (“BSER”) with a less costly and burdensome BSER determination for new coal-fired units. Also, in 2018, EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) Rule to replace the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which represented the Obama administration’s signature policy to regulate GHGs. The proposed ACE rule would establish emission guidelines for states to address GHGs from existing coal-fired power plants and update the BSER for those plants. 
EPA’s approach to regulating GHG emissions may change again under future administrations. Therefore, the impact on our Facilities due to future GHG regulation is unknown.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (“EPCRA”)
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our Facilities periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from their equipment. Our Facilities periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned start-up, shutdown and malfunction events. From time to time, EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-

to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if a release violates the law or our permits, we could become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”)
Our facilities are subject to the RCRA requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. When feasible, RCRA-regulated materials are recycled instead of being disposed of on-site or off-site. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides governing current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal practices, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10 (“Commitments and Contingencies”), “Environmental, Health and Safety (“EHS”) Matters” for further discussion of “RCRA Compliance Matters.”

Waste Management - There are two closed hazardous waste units at the Coffeyville Refinery and fourteen other solid waste management units in the process of being closed pending state agency approval. There is one closed hazardous waste unit and one active hazardous waste storage tank at the Wynnewood Refinery. In addition, one closed, interim status, hazardous waste land farm located at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is under long-term post closure care.
Impacts of Past Manufacturing - In March 2004, two of our subsidiaries entered into a Consent Decree (“2004 Consent Decree”) with the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (the “KDHE”) which required us to assume two RCRA corrective action orders issued to Farmland, the prior owner of the Coffeyville refinery. We are also subject to a 1994 EPA administrative order related to investigation of possible past releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Coffeyville Refinery. In accordance with the order, we have conducted the required investigation and interim remediation projects and documented existing soil and groundwater conditions. In June 2017, the Coffeyville Refinery submitted an amended RCRA post-closure permit application to KDHE to complete closure of former hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville Refinery and to perform corrective action at the site. The now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is subject to a 1996 EPA administrative order related to investigation of releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Phillipsburg terminal, which operated as a refinery until 1991. The Phillipsburg terminal investigation is complete and corrective measures to be implemented to address the EPA’s Statement of Basis and Final Remedy Decision issued in July 2018 are being evaluated. The Wynnewood Refinery operates under a RCRA permit. A RCRA facility investigation has been completed in accordance with the terms of the permit. Based on the facility investigation and other available information, WRC has entered into a consent order with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (“ODEQ”) requiring further investigations of groundwater conditions and enhancements of existing remediation systems. We have completed the groundwater investigation at the Wynnewood Refinery and ODEQ has approved our ongoing corrective actions.
Financial Assurance - We are required, under the 2004 Consent Decree, to establish financial assurance to secure the current projected clean-up costs of $6 million for the Coffeyville Refinery and $6 million for the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal in the event we fail to fulfill our clean-up obligations. In accordance with the 2004 Consent Decree, as modified by a 2010 agreement between CRRM, CRT, the EPA and the KDHE, this financial assurance is currently provided by a bond in the amount of $3 million for clean-up obligations at the Phillipsburg terminal and a letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million for estimated costs to close regulated hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville Refinery. Additional self-funded financial assurance of approximately $6 million and $3 million is required to meet our RCRA financial assistance obligations for the Coffeyville Refinery and Phillipsburg terminal, respectively. The $3 million bond amount is reduced each year based on actual expenditures for corrective actions and the letter of credit and the self-funded mechanisms are re-evaluated and adjusted on an annual basis. Current RCRA financial assurance requirements for the Wynnewood Refinery total $0.2 million for hazardous waste storage tank closure and post-closure monitoring of a closed storm water retention pond.
Environmental Remediation
As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by crude oil or hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. There is no assurance that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to the release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or crude oil for which we have potential liability or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material.

Environmental Insurance
We are covered by a site pollution legal liability insurance policy. The policy includes business interruption coverage. The policy insures any location owned, leased or rented or operated by the Company, including the Refineries and the nitrogen fertilizer facilities. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at or migrating from a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we maintain umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies which include sudden and accidental pollution coverage. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period.
The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies are subject to retentions and deductibles and contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Health, Safety and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.

We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), “Wynnewood Refinery Incident” of this Report for further discussion of OSHA. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,450 employees including those employed by CVR Refining, CVR Partners, and the Company and its other subsidiaries corporate support functions. Our Petroleum Segment had approximately 950 employees at December 31, 2018 across both of its facilities and its logistics operations, including approximately 520 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire on various dates ranging from March 2019 to June 2021. Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment had approximately 290 employees at December 31, 2018 across both of its facilities, including approximately 100 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in October 2019.
