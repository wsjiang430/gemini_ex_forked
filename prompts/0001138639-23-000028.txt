ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Overview
Infinera Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our”, “Infinera” or the "Company") is a semiconductor manufacturer and a global supplier of networking solutions comprised of networking equipment, optical semiconductors, software and services. Our portfolio of solutions includes optical transport platforms, converged packet-optical transport platforms, compact modular platforms, optical line systems, coherent optical engines and subsystems, a suite of automation software offerings, and support and professional services. Leveraging our U.S.-based compound semiconductor fabrication plant ("fab") and in-house packaging capabilities, we design, develop, and manufacture industry-leading indium phosphide-based photonic integrated circuits ("PICs") for use in Infinera’s vertically integrated, high-capacity optical communications products.
Our customers include operators of fixed line and mobile networks, including telecommunications service providers, internet content providers (“ICPs”), cable providers, wholesale carriers, research and education institutions, large enterprises, utilities and government entities. Our networking solutions enable our customers to deliver high-bandwidth business and consumer communications services. Our comprehensive portfolio of networking solutions also enables our customers to scale their transport networks as end-user services and applications continue to drive growth in demand for network bandwidth. These end-user services and applications include, but are not limited to, high-speed internet access, 4G/5G mobile broadband, cloud-based services, high-definition video streaming services, virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of Things (“IoT”), business Ethernet services and data center interconnect ("DCI").
As an optical semiconductor manufacturer, we specialize in the manufacturing of optical compound semiconductors using indium phosphide ("InP"). This technology is used in telecommunications networks to transmit massive amounts of data and power critical communications services like 5G, enhanced broadband, and high-capacity data center connectivity. Infinera has made significant investments in our unique research, development, fabrication, and packaging facilities, including our optical compound semiconductor fab in Silicon Valley. We optimize the manufacturing process by using InP to build our PICs, which enables the integration of hundreds of optical functions onto a single, monolithic optical semiconductor chip. The unique capabilities of our optical semiconductor fab, which has provided our customers with a critical and secure source of U.S.-produced optical semiconductors and strengthened the supply chain, have enabled us to consistently pioneer critical technology advancements. For example, our latest generation of technology has made it possible to transmit information at a rate of 800 gigabits per second (“Gb/s”) using a single laser. 
We support U.S. government efforts to advance and increase the domestic manufacturing base for semiconductors as a matter of economic and national security. Compound semiconductors – including those based in InP – are an important part of the domestic semiconductor industry and will enable the next-generation of leading-edge technologies. Domestic manufacturing is critical in order to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of compound semiconductor materials and components, which is essential to economic growth and to the security of our domestic communications infrastructure.
The large-scale integration of our PICs and advanced digital signal processors (“DSPs”) enables us to develop and manufacture high-performance optical engines that are used in our coherent optical networking system and subsystem solutions. These solutions include features that customers care about the most, including reduced cost per bit, lower footprint and power consumption, and improved performance, reliability and security. Coherent optical solutions are becoming increasingly important across the network as our customers transition to 800 Gb/s per wavelength transmission speeds and beyond in the core, 400 Gb/s in the metro, and 100 Gb/s in the access market segment. We believe our vertical integration strategy provides a competitive advantage by enabling leading optical performance at higher optical speeds with increased spectral efficiency, greater control over our supply chain, and a lower cost structure.
We have grown our solutions portfolio through internal development as well as acquisitions, including the acquisition of Telecom Holding Parent LLC (“Coriant”), a privately held global supplier of open network solutions for the largest global network operators (the “Acquisition”). These developments positioned us to be one of the leading providers of vertically integrated optical networking solutions in the world with the ability to serve a global customer base with accelerated delivery of the innovative solutions our customers demand. In 2021, we announced an expansion of our portfolio with the introduction of a suite of coherent optical pluggables 
designed to seamlessly address the rapidly growing market for point-to-point solutions as well as create a new category of point-to-multipoint solutions that can enable a dramatically more cost-efficient network architecture. Based on our vertically integrated optical semiconductor technology and supporting a range of high-speed transport rates that include 800 Gb/s, 400 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s, this suite of coherent optical pluggables builds on our history of delivering innovative, highly differentiated, and vertically integrated coherent optical engines.
Our products are designed to be managed by a suite of software solutions that enable simplified network management and automated operations. We also provide software-enabled programmability that offers differentiated capabilities such as Instant Bandwidth. Combined with our differentiated hardware solutions, Instant Bandwidth enables our customers to purchase and activate bandwidth as needed through our unique software licensing feature set. This, in turn, allows our customers to accomplish two key objectives: (1) limit their initial network startup costs and investments; and (2) instantly activate new bandwidth as their customers’ and their own network capacity needs evolve.
We believe our systems and subsystems portfolios benefit our customers by providing a unique combination of highly scalable capacity and features that address access to core transport network applications and ultimately simplify and automate network operations. Our high-performance optical transport solutions leverage the industry shift to open optical network architectures and enable our customers to efficiently and cost-effectively meet bandwidth demand, which continues to grow 30% or more year-over-year.
We were incorporated in December 2000 and originally operated under the name “Zepton Networks.” We are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 6373 San Ignacio Avenue, San Jose, CA 95119. Our telephone number is (408) 572-5200. “Infinera,” “FlexCoherent,” and the Infinera logo, are trademarks or service marks of Infinera Corporation in the United States, certain other countries and/or the European Union. Any other trademarks or trade names mentioned are the property of their respective owners.
Industry Background
Optical transport networking equipment carries digital information using light waves over fiber optic cables. With the advent of dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”) systems, data is transmitted by using multiple wavelengths of light using different frequencies or colors over a single optical fiber. Customers deploy DWDM systems to carry information between continents, across countries, between cities and within metropolitan areas, and in some cases all the way to the end-user. Fiber optic networks are generally capable of carrying most types of communications traffic. Coherent optical technology is the latest innovation in DWDM transmission solutions, dramatically increasing the amount of information a single laser can transmit.
We believe that a number of trends in the communications industry are driving demand for large amounts of network bandwidth and ultimately will increase demand for advanced optical transport networking solutions. These trends include:
•growth of cloud services; 
•growth of over-the-top services and high-definition video streaming;
•growth of mobile broadband services, including 4G and emerging 5G services;
•growth of edge computing resources closer to end-users;
•increasing use of connected virtual and augmented reality devices; and
•the IoT, which continues to drive massive growth in the number of network-connected devices.
As network traffic grows, network operators will need to continue to add transmission capacity to existing optical networks or deploy new systems and/or subsystems to address bandwidth demand and offer new end-user services. 
We believe we are in the midst of an important shift in transport network architectures that impact the markets we serve. The shift to open and disaggregated networks is increasingly being embraced by the communications industry. Examples of this trend include separation of compute, storage, and networking in data centers, the separation of hardware, operating system and applications in smart phones, hardware/software separation in network function virtualization and hardware and software routing stack routers, and open radio access network initiatives for 5G. Industry evolution is now enabling optical networking to leverage these same principles of openness and disaggregation. 
Optical networking technology has evolved to enable open networks at the physical and management layer. These technologies allow network operators to move from a traditional vendor locked-in model to a more flexible model where they can choose from a collection of modular, best-of-breed solutions from different suppliers for each network function. Open and standards-based interfaces ease the integration into a unified network architecture. 
The shift to open optical networking provides network operators with key benefits that include:
•Accelerated innovation cycles: By leveraging the full innovation capabilities of the optical ecosystem, network operators are able to select best-in-class technologies and vendors independently throughout the network lifecycle. Solution providers can also develop innovative technologies for specific network functions without having to supply end-to-end networking solutions, significantly broadening the innovation ecosystem. 
•Optimized network architectures: By selecting the ideal products and technologies for each layer and domain of the network independently, network operators are able to optimize their optical network for specific applications and services and avoid the constraints of a single-vendor for one-size-fits-all solutions.
•Improved network economics: Open optical networks enable cost-per-bit reducing innovations to be quickly deployed throughout the network lifecycle, with customized multi-vendor network designs providing additional scope for cost-optimization as capacity and service demands evolve.
A second shift is happening at the edge of the network, where capacity is growing beyond the ability of traditional, non-coherent optical solutions to address. This increasing capacity demand is driving the need for innovative edge- and access-optimized coherent optical transport solutions. These include more compact, efficient and cost-effective solutions as well as innovative coherent optical pluggable solutions such as ICE-X optics point-to-point and point-to-multipoint technology that can enable significant cost savings by simplifying network architectures.

In the metro market, we face the same competitors as in long-haul, in addition to Cisco, ADVA Optical Networking, Ribbon Communications, and Fujitsu, among others. In the DCI market we also face competition from vendors that are selling optical components such as pluggable optics directly to customers as opposed to DWDM systems. In addition to our current competitors, other companies have developed, or may in the future develop, system and subsystem products that are, or could be, competitive with our products. This includes companies such as Lumentum, Marvell, II-IV and potential competitors in China. We also may encounter competitor consolidation in the markets in which we compete, which could lead to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, and could impact our results of operations.
Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, technical, financial, sales and marketing resources and may be perceived by our customers and suppliers to have greater financial stability, and better-established relationships with potential customers than we have. Many of our competitors have more resources and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies, and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively. Further, many of our competitors have built long-standing relationships with some of our prospective and existing customers and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could, therefore, have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers.

In the U.S., we have commenced partnerships with non-profits and historically black colleges and universities to increase our pipeline of diverse talent. In our larger sites globally, we provide training on inclusive hiring and are posting roles on platforms and job boards targeted at diverse talent pools enabling greater access to diverse talent.
Employee engagement is critical to building a unified and global culture that values local needs and perspectives. To foster inclusion and promote these efforts, we support several ERGs, including African Descent/Black at Infinera, Latin America, and Women at Infinera ("WIN").
WIN works to provide our female employees with access to conferences, networking events and other prominent engagements in the technology industry, as well as to support greater opportunities for career growth, internships, and leadership. In 2022, we continued to expand WIN activities and participation, including the introduction of our mentoring program, the formation of subcommittees, and a speakers’ program addressing topics including development, recruitment and retention of women. In various locations, employees have also partnered with local nonprofits and schools to encourage female students to pursue STEM careers.
In 2022, we continued to provide DEI training for our global employee base. Training topics are focused on global diversity, employees' roles in workplace diversity and related matters. Recruiters and managers participate in training on topics such as ensuring a diverse applicant pool and overcoming unconscious bias in the workplace and in interviews. 
In addition, we launched a global employee survey in 2022 which included questions on DEI matters. The positive results and constructive feedback from this survey will enable us to accelerate program development to advance DEI progress at Infinera. 
As of December 31, 2022, women represented 19% of our global employees and minorities represented approximately 37% of our U.S. workforce.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
Our goal is to incentivize our talented employees with a total compensation package that is market-competitive as validated through independent data sources. Our total compensation for eligible employees includes base salary, bonuses and equity awards. We intend to maintain ongoing competitiveness for attracting and retaining talent. We continuously improve our human resources information systems for workforce data collection, monitoring, and reporting, and expect that this will allow us to improve our understanding of compensation equity around the globe to ensure fair pay. We also seek to provide market-competitive benefits as part of our total reward structure for all employees around the globe and their dependents. In 2022, we conducted a global gender-based pay equity assessment and a race-based pay equity assessment in the U.S. to support consistency and equity in our pay practices.
We have also invested in creating physically safe work environments for our essential on-site workforce, which is important given our status as a critical infrastructure business with manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and research and development sites in several countries. To advance these efforts, we have a global leadership team comprised of local site leaders that meets regularly to support compliance with all local and international guidelines and establishes best practices at every site. We are committed to providing employees with a healthy and safe work environment by striving to prevent accidents and improve workplace conditions, and continuously working to improve our processes and performance. Our health and safety programs emphasize personal accountability, professional conduct, and regulatory compliance, while our culture fosters a sense of proactivity, caution, empathy and communication.
In the U.S., we have also continued to support COVID-19 testing for essential on-site employees at no cost to employees. We also provide paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19, which in many cases is beyond what is required by local laws. 
We have also continued to emphasize employee well-being. For example, in the U.S., the Employee Assistance Program benefit includes mental health counseling for help with personal issues, childcare and eldercare referrals, financial coaching, legal consultation and wellness tools. Employees are provided medical, dental, vision, long-term and short-term disability, and life insurance, and employees covered under our health insurance have access to various wellness programs. Employees are provided paid parental leave as new parents (birth or adoption). Eligible employees are also qualified to receive unlimited flexible time off. We also provide training on matters such as working effectively with teams in a remote environment and making meetings more effective.
Growth and Development
We believe that transparency and integrity help foster a culture of professional growth. We continuously evolve our approach to employee communication, from a company-wide perspective to functional communication to smaller team meetings, all the way to one-on-one discussions. With that in mind, we encourage our employees to share candid feedback about working for our company through feedback channels, including employee surveys and on public forums such as Glassdoor.com. Our management utilizes this feedback as we work to consistently improve our employee experience.
We have also expanded our WIN mentorship program to become a global mentorship program to empower all employees within Infinera to advance their careers and realize their full potential. By facilitating mentor-mentee relationships, this program provides a unique opportunity for reflection, self-examination, and the development of practical skills for mentees while simultaneously providing mentors with fresh perspectives, insights, opinions and an opportunity to have a direct hand in the development of future leaders.
Experiential learning is powerful in career development, which is why we provide global job-based learning opportunities including cross-functional transfers and expanded roles. Education also enables the advancement of our DEI initiatives, which is one of our core values and a continued area of focus for us. In 2022, we also significantly expanded our learning and development initiatives, including the rollout of a scalable, multi-language e-learning platform that enables the proliferation of global, diverse and professional education.
Manufacturing
We have invested significant time and capital to develop and improve the manufacturing processes we use to produce and package our products. This includes significant investments in personnel, equipment and the facilities needed to manufacture and package our products in California and Pennsylvania. We also have invested in automating our manufacturing process and in training and maintaining the quality of our manufacturing workforce. As a leader in the development of photonic integration, our manufacturing processes have been developed over many years and are protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual protections. We believe that the investments we have made towards the manufacturing and packaging of our products provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our current manufacturing facilities, including our fabrication facility for our PICs in California and our module manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, can accommodate an increase in production capacity as our business continues to grow.
We also use contract manufacturers to assemble portions of our products. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble products according to our specifications and bills of material. For elements of our business where we outsource, we perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to ensure the reliability of our products. Our supply chain risk mitigation strategies are continuous and institutionalized in our supply chain design for external manufacturing and for procurement of components. We currently use three contract manufacturers in several different countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, China, Mexico and Hungary, and we maintain the capability to transfer select manufacturing activities to U.S. qualified factories of three electronic manufacturing services partners.
We expect all suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which addresses the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, and compliance with applicable laws.
Backlog
Our backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product shipments and services to be provided in future periods. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the amount or timing of the related revenue to change, and, in certain cases, purchase orders may be canceled without penalty. Orders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following order receipt and may relate to multi-year support service obligations. As a result, we believe that backlog should not be viewed as an accurate indicator of future operating results for any particular period. A backlogged purchase order may not result in revenue in a particular period, and the actual revenue may not be equal to our backlog amounts. Our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with that of other companies in our industry.
Intellectual Property
Our innovative software and optical engine technologies, including our PIC, DSP, module and related technologies, are foundational to our products and we believe they are highly valued by our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage. 
We believe our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. However, there can be no assurances that these protections will be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage or that others have not or will not reverse engineer our designs or discover, develop or disclose the same or similar designs and manufacturing processes.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 1,054 U.S. patents and 497 international patents expiring between 2023 and 2042, and held 177 U.S. and 116 foreign pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.
We may not receive any competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property. Any patents granted to us may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of our business, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the impact of these patents cannot be predicted with certainty.
We believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement is increasing as patent holders, including entities that are not in our industry and who purchase patents as an investment or to monetize such rights by obtaining royalties, use such actions as a competitive tactic as well as a source of additional revenue. 
For example, we are currently involved in litigation for alleged patent infringement. See the information set forth under the heading “Legal Matters” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8 for additional information regarding such litigation. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or could include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
In addition to trade secret and patent protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary software and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and through a combination of U.S. and international copyright laws.
We license some of our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on our customers’ ability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on non-disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements with our employees and consultants that acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individual within the scope of and during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require that each person maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. We also rely on contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products.
We incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our use of such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance with open source software license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual property infringement and/or contractual claims. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Governmental Regulations
Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products and services. Our business and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE"), Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("RoHS"), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") regulations adopted by the European Union. Environmental regulation is increasing and we expect that our operations will be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which may expose us to additional costs. We are also subject to disclosure requirements related to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products. To date, our compliance costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Other Laws and Regulations. We are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition to the environmental laws and regulations discussed above, we are subject to laws and regulations addressing the telecommunications industry, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, export and import control, trade sanctions, and anti-bribery and anti-corruption. To date, our compliance costs relating to these laws and regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
For further discussion of risks associated with these governmental laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors.”
