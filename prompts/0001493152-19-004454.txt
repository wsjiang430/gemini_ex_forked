ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
Strategic Acquisitions, Inc. (the “Company” or “Strategic”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 27, 1989. Since inception the Company had no revenues other than nominal interest income. As of the date hereof, the Company has no commercial operations, has no full- or part-time employees, and owns no real estate.
 
The Company’s current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire a business, and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership. The Company has limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity. The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings.
 
At the present time the Company has not identified any business opportunity that it plans to pursue, nor has the Company reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition.
 
No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given that limited funds are available for acquisitions, or that any acquisition that occurs will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its stockholders.
 
The Company’s search will be directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises which have a desire to become public corporations and which are able to satisfy, or anticipate in the reasonably near future being able to satisfy, the minimum asset requirements in order to qualify shares for trading on NASDAQ or another stock exchange.
 
The Company anticipates that the business opportunities presented to it will (i) be recently organized with no operating history, or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) be experiencing financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop a new product or service or to expand into a new market; (iv) be relying upon an untested product or marketing concept; or (v) have a combination of the characteristics mentioned in (i) through (iv) above. The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued. Given the above factors, investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have a history of losses or low profitability.
 
The Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry, and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources. The Company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
In connection with such a merger or acquisition, it is highly likely that an amount of stock constituting control of the Company would be issued by the Company or purchased from the current principal shareholders of the Company by the acquiring entity or its affiliates. If stock is purchased from the current shareholders, the transaction is very likely to result in substantial gains to them relative to their purchase price for such stock. In the Company’s judgment, none of its officers and directors would thereby become an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”).
 
It is anticipated that business opportunities will come to the Company’s attention from various sources, including its officers and directors, its other stockholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no plans, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for the Company, although its officers, directors and significant shareholders seek out such opportunities and respond to unsolicited proposals in their ordinary course of business.

The Company does not foresee that it would enter into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which its officers or directors are currently affiliated. Should the Company determine in the future, contrary to foregoing expectations, that a transaction with an affiliate would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Company is in general permitted by Nevada law to enter into such a transaction if:
 
1. The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors, and the Board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; or
 
2. The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or
 
3. The contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors or the stockholders.
 
Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities
 
To a large extent, a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon management’s analysis of the quality of the other company’s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of the possible need to shift marketing approaches substantially, expand significantly, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make other changes. The Company will be dependent upon the owners of a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement, or be primarily responsible for the implementation of, required changes. Because the Company may participate in a business opportunity with a newly organized firm or with a firm which is entering a new phase of growth, it should be emphasized that the Company will incur further risks, because management in many instances will not have proven its abilities or effectiveness, the eventual market for such company’s products or services will likely not be established, and such company may not be profitable when acquired.
 
It is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify, but will essentially be limited to only one venture because of the Company’s limited financing. This lack of diversification will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one business opportunity against profits from another, and should be considered an adverse factor affecting any decision to purchase the Company’s securities.
 
It is emphasized that management of the Company may effect transactions having a potentially adverse impact upon the Company’s shareholders pursuant to the authority and discretion of the Company’s management to complete acquisitions without submitting any proposal to the stockholders for their consideration. Holders of the Company’s securities should not anticipate that the Company necessarily will furnish such holders, prior to any merger or acquisition, with financial statements, or any other documentation, concerning a target company or its business. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the stockholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by such directors, to seek the stockholders’ advice and consent, or because state law so requires.
 
The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers and directors. Although there are no current plans to do so, Company management might also hire an outside consultant to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities,and might pay a finder’s fee. Since Company management has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service, or regarding the total amount of fees that may be paid. However, because of the limited resources of the Company, it is likely that any such fee would be paid in stock and not in cash.

In assessing a potential transaction, the Company anticipates that it will consider, among other things, the following factors:
 
1. Potential for growth and profitability, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion, or new products;
 
2. The Company’s perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by the Company’s stockholders;
 
3. Whether, following the business combination, the financial condition of the business opportunity would be, or would have a significant prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming sufficient to enable the securities of the Company to qualify for trading in the over-the-counter markets or listing on a securities exchange;
 
4. Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other sources;
 
5. The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
 
6. Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry;
 
7. Strength and diversity of existing management, or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment; and
 
8. The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items.
 
No one of the factors described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity, and management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Potential investors must recognize that, because of the Company’s limited capital available for investigation and management’s limited experience in business analysis, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. It should be noted that the Company has not completed a transaction in over twenty years of its existence.
 
The Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity. It expects, however, that the analysis of specific proposals, if and when any are received, and the selection of a business opportunity may take several months or more.
 
The Company has no business proposals under consideration as of the date of this annual report.

Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing such items as a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or services marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurances that audited financial statements would be able to be produced prior to completion of a merger transaction; and other information deemed relevant.
 
As part of the Company’s investigation, the Company’s executive officers and directors may meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management expertise.
 
Company management believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current shareholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through the public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates which have a need for an immediate cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative.
 
Form of Acquisition
 
It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there can be no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.

It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Internal Revenue Code”), depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e., 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the current officers, directors and principal shareholders.
 
It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available, from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.
 
The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms.
 
As a general matter, the Company anticipates that it, and/or its officers and principal shareholders will enter into a letter of intent with the management, principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to signing a binding agreement. Such a letter of intent will set forth the terms of the proposed acquisition but will not bind any of the parties to consummate the transaction. Execution of a letter of intent will by no means indicate that consummation of an acquisition is probable. Neither the Company nor any of the other parties to the letter of intent will be bound to consummate the acquisition unless and until a definitive agreement concerning the acquisition as described in the preceding paragraph is executed. Even after a definitive agreement is executed, it is possible that the acquisition would not be consummated should any party elect to exercise any right provided in the agreement to terminate it on specified grounds.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision were made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure goods and services.
 
An acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal, state or local authorities. Compliance with such regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process.

Competition
 
The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive opportunities, primarily from business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. The Company also will possibly experience competition from other public “Blank Check” companies, some of which may have more funds available than does the Company.
No Rights of Dissenting Shareholders
 
The Company does not intend to provide its shareholders with disclosure documentation concerning a possible target company prior to acquisition, because the Nevada Business Corporation Act vests authority in the board of directors to decide and approve matters involving acquisitions within certain restrictions. If any transaction is structured as an acquisition, not a merger, with the Company being the parent company and the acquire being merged into a wholly owned subsidiary, a shareholder will have no right of dissent under Nevada law.
Employees
 
The Company has no employees. Management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities. The Company has periodically paid its Secretary/Treasurer for services in bookkeeping, recordkeeping, filing tax forms and filing of reports with the SEC. The Company has also recently paid a director and an entity controlled by the Company’s President for consulting services in connection with evaluating certain business opportunities on behalf of the Company. Although there is no current plan with respect to its nature or amount, additional remuneration may be paid to or accrued for the benefit of, the Company’s officers or directors prior to, or in conjunction with, the completion of a business acquisition for services actually rendered.
