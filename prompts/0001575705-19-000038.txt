ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General
 
Vyrex Corporation (“Vyrex” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada in 1991 and operated as a research and development stage company seeking to discover and develop pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals for the treatment and prevention of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and conditions associated with aging (the “Biotech Business”). The Biotech Business was unsuccessful and, as a result, the Company ceased material operations relating to that business in October 2005; however, the Company retained its intellectual property rights and contract rights relating to that business (the “Biotech IP”). On October 17, 2005, the Company reincorporated in Delaware.
 
On February 11, 2008, Vyrex, PowerVerde, Inc. (“PowerVerde”) and Vyrex Acquisition Corporation (“VAC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vyrex, all Delaware corporations, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on February 12, 2008, VAC merged with and into PowerVerde, with PowerVerde remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vyrex (the “Merger”). As consideration for the Merger, as of the closing of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of PowerVerde was converted into the right to receive 1.2053301 shares of the common stock of Vyrex and each share of VAC was converted into one share of PowerVerde common stock. As a result of the Merger, the former shareholders of PowerVerde held 95% of the common stock of Vyrex.
 
On August 6, 2008, at a special meeting of shareholders, Vyrex’s name was changed to “PowerVerde, Inc.” Simultaneously, the name of our operating company, PowerVerde, Inc., was changed to “PowerVerde Systems, Inc.”
 
In March 2009, we sold all of the Biotech IP other than existing licensing contract rights to Dr. Edward Gomez, a pre-Merger investor in PowerVerde and now a shareholder of the Company. In exchange for the assignment of the Biotech IP to him, Dr. Gomez agreed to (i) pay all future costs and expenses relating to the Biotech IP, including, but not limited to, patent fees, license fees and legal fees, and (ii) pay to the Company 20% of all net revenues received from the sale and/or licensing of any of the Biotech IP.
 
Please note that the information provided below relates to the combined company after the Merger. Since our operations after the Merger consist solely of PowerVerde operations, except where the context otherwise requires, references throughout this Report hereafter to “PowerVerde,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” will mean or refer to PowerVerde’s business and operations.
 
The Company is a Delaware corporation formed in March 2007 by George Konrad and Fred Barker. Mr. Konrad served as an officer and director of the Company until October 2012. Mr. Barker served as an officer and director until January 2015. See Item 10 “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.” The Company was formed in order to further develop, commercialize and market a series of unique electric generating power systems designed to produce electrical power with zero emissions or waste byproducts, based on a patented pressure-driven expander motor and related organic rankine cycle technology. The design of the motor was conceived by Mr. Barker in January 2001. Mr. Barker previously had a working relationship with Mr. Konrad and enlisted Mr. Konrad and his manufacturing expertise, together with Mr. Barker’s own engineering expertise, to co-develop the motor. As a research and development company, we have tested and continue to test other style drivers as well.
 
1


An initial prototype of the motor was created and tested in early 2002, and, based on positive test results, Messrs. Barker and Konrad concluded that the concept could lead to a commercial product. A new design was developed in early 2007, which resulted in a motor that produced more torque and horsepower, as well as being easier to mass produce. The prototype was tested extensively, and substantial tooling and engineering with CAM/CNC programming was completed at the facility of Mr. Konrad’s company, Arizona Research and Development (“ARD”), for the possibility of an eventual mass production model. The Company has since abandoned this style of expander and is now focused on a new planetary or quad rotor style expander or motor.
 
Based on data learned from these earlier prototypes, PowerVerde has manufactured, retrofitted or purchased from third party manufacturers, different expanders and related generation equipment. The Company has been testing these devices on a more powerful and advanced organic rankine cycle (ORC) system referred to as the Liberator. The Company has also built and tested a 100kW pressure-driven motor at another machining and manufacturing facility, Global Machine Works, in Arlington, WA. These two related but distinct systems are designed for two different markets. The 25/50kW system uses low-grade heat source (waste heat) as a fuel source, expanding a working fluid thereby driving the expander/generator, while the 100kW system (without ORC) uses wasted energy (pressure) from natural gas pipeline or wellhead infrastructures to drive the motor/generator and create electric power. In early 2010, our Board of Directors created two separate product lines: waste heat/solar organic rankine cycle powered systems; and gas pipeline/wellhead waste energy recovery systems.
 
In November 2011, we entered into a binding letter of intent for the acquisition of all of the membership interests in Cornerstone Conservation Group LLC, Scottsdale, Arizona (“Cornerstone”). The acquisition was consummated pursuant to a definitive agreement executed in March 2012. Cornerstone’s main asset is its proprietary Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (“CCHP”) technology, which utilizes waste heat from commercial and residential heating, ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration (“HVACR”) systems. Cornerstone also has substantial experience and technology relating to geothermal or ground source heat pumps.
 
As consideration for the Cornerstone acquisition, we issued (i) a total of 2,250,000 restricted shares of our common stock to Cornerstone’s members, Bryce Johnson (“Johnson”), Paul Kelly (“Kelly”) and Vincent Hils (“Hils”) in the amounts of 1,575,000, 337,500 and 337,500 shares, respectively, (ii) 10,000 restricted shares to a Cornerstone employee, and (iii) three year warrants to purchase 150,000 shares each to Johnson and Kelly at exercise prices of $2.00 and $4.00 per share. In November 2011, Johnson joined our Board of Directors, and in January 2012 we moved our operations to a facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned by Johnson. See “Item 2 Properties.” Johnson also became our chief operating officer in January 2012. Johnson resigned from his officer and director positions in March 2013. As a result of Johnson’s resignation, Management decided to impair the goodwill entirely as of December 31, 2012. We continue to operate our laboratory and test the Liberator within Mr. Johnson’s facility, where several infrastructure upgrades have been completed. There can be no assurance that our good relationship with Mr. Johnson regarding use of his facility will continue. See Item 2 “Properties.”
 
We believe that Cornerstone’s technology is complementary to PowerVerde’s platform and existing markets – mainly through the conversion of thermal energy into electric power generation. While we believe that the Cornerstone acquisition brings substantial opportunities for synergy, there can be no assurance that the acquisition will prove successful.
 
Certain of our non-combustion expanders are fueled by heat (waste heat), via an ORC related system, and create a pressure source powering the PowerVerde expander/generator while emitting zero carbon emissions or waste stream byproducts. The other PowerVerde system, designed to operate on wellhead or natural gas pipeline infrastructure, lacks the ORC component, but includes a pressure cycle known as the Wet Steam Cycle (WSC) using our licensed planetary-style expander. This latter system uses wasted latent energy (pressure) inherent in “city gate” letdowns or wellheads as its pressure source.

Our ORC system requires:
 

● | A heat source (solar, waste heat, geothermal or bio-mass); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | An organic rankine cycle (ORC) or WSC style system to convert heat into pressure;
● | PowerVerde expander to convert the pressure into horsepower; and 
● | A generator to convert the horsepower into electricity. 

 
Our WSC system requires:
 

● | a pressure source such as gas wellhead; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
● | a planetary expander: and 
● | an off-the-shelf commodity boiler to create heated steam.

 
We have built and tested the 25/50kW ORC systems, and we believe that the overall design meets or exceeds performance metrics when compared to the industry at large. We have, however, remained challenged with our inability to thus far generate the continuous hours of operation that we believe necessary for commercial quality expectations. We continue to work toward our goal of a system capable of 20,000 hours (almost three years) of continuous operation. Meanwhile, we believe that we have made great strides in the evolution of our waste heat energy systems, and we continue to pursue opportunities for the commercialization of our Systems. There can be no assurance, however, that our ongoing technical issues will be resolved or that any of our Systems will ever be commercially viable.
 
PowerVerde has responded to its difficulties in producing commercially viable systems by focusing on expanders for non-traditional sources such as high temperature/high pressure applications, including supercritical or near supercritical conditions. Within this field of interest PowerVerde designed and patented a unique wet steam cycle (WSC) process that uses steam instead of refrigerants but at conditions well beyond that offered by commercially available systems.
 
In late 2017, PowerVerde was introduced to a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation commonly referred to as the “Reinventing the Toilet Project”. The foundation is focused on global sanitation improvements. One of the foundation-supported projects, ongoing for the past six years, involves a technology being developed at Duke University. This technology consists mainly of a chemical reaction called supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). The concept requires a unique reactor or bioreactor that converts organic matter such as fecal sludge into pathogen-free water and mineral ash. This bioreactor, utilizing compressors and pumps, is energy intensive. However, the reaction itself is exothermic, meaning it gives off heat during the reaction. The caloric value (heat content) of the fecal sludge is the source of this heat release. If this heat release is captured and converted into electricity the bioreactor’s parasitic energy requirements may be offset or eliminated or may even result in net electricity produced. In the latter example the bioreactor, designed for processing municipal fecal sludge, becomes an electrical-generating machine producing free electricity as a byproduct.
 
After a highly competitive global search, as we announced in April 2018, PowerVerde was selected by Duke to develop the residual heat-to-power system to work in conjunction with the bioreactor. We have begun the engineering and design process. Our selection was likely influenced by our focus on high temperature and pressure expanders and consistent with our WSC design. We believe that developing applications for the underserved high temperature/pressure market is our best pathway to profitability. We believe the SCWO application is an excellent fit for our new product goal of providing expanders and systems capable of operating at elevated operating conditions where competition is limited.

To maintain our focus of designing small energy systems, typically under 500 kilowatts and usually utilizing non-turbine expanders, we have made a decision to transition into a specialty engineering company. Our focus is now directed on applications where our ability to design and operate at elevated conditions gives us a substantial competitive edge. We believe that price points are less important when necessity meets reality, or where resources and options are scarce. As such PowerVerde has partnered with 374Water, a newly formed for-profit corporation, spun out of Duke University, hoping to revolutionize the way municipal fecal sludge is processed. 374 Celsius is the temperature at which water becomes supercritical, hence the name 374Water. In its supercritical state water becomes a dense gas. PowerVerde is currently designing expanders capable of working at near supercritical conditions involving high temperature and pressure for this project. We have agreed in principle with 374Water on an initial budget of approximately $500,000 for the first stage of this collaboration. 374Water is currently seeking to raise private equity capital. We expect to receive an approximately $500,000 purchase order after 374Water’s financing is complete, which we believe will occur in the second quarter of 2019; however, there can be no assurance that 374Water will be able to raise the funds it needs, that 374Water will issue the expected purchase order upon completion of the financing, or that 374Water will be successful in its business. If we do not receive the 374Water order as expected, our business and financial condition will be materially adversely affected, as we do not have any alternatives for generating material revenues in the near future.
 
Our main source of funding, the Biotech IP license contract, expired in March 2018. We received our final installment of Biotech IP revenue in the second quarter of 2018, based on royalties accrued in the first quarter of 2018 in the amount of $159,094. Going forward, unless and until we are able to successfully commercialize our Systems and generate positive cash flow from operations, through the 374Water project or otherwise, we will have to rely on privately-raised equity and/or debt capital to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to do so, we will have to cease operations.
 
Employees
 
We currently have one full-time employee: Mark Prinz based in Scottsdale, Arizona. Mr. Prinz was hired in 2011. Our chief engineer, Hank Leibowitz, was hired pursuant to a part-time consulting agreement in October 2012. Mr. Leibowitz has been designated our chief design engineer.
Patents
 
Messrs. Barker and Konrad together obtained U.S. Patent No. 6,840,151 for a “push-push type fluid pressure actuated motor,” which was issued on January 11, 2005. On June 6, 2007, Messrs. Barker and Konrad and the Company’s predecessor, PowerVerde, LLC, permanently and exclusively assigned to PowerVerde all rights to the patent and the other intellectual property relating to the PowerVerde systems. On July 16, 2008, Messrs. Barker and Konrad filed U.S. Patent application No. 61/081,298 for a “system to produce electricity using waste energy in natural gas pipelines.” This application was assigned to the Company; however, it was abandoned in 2009 because we decided to replace it with a new and improved provisional patent application regarding the natural gas pipeline technology. Mr. Barker filed on behalf of PowerVerde a new provisional patent application regarding this technology on April 7, 2010. On October 17, 2008, Mr. Konrad and Mr. Brian K. Gray filed U.S. Patent application No. 12/253,580 for a “low temperature organic rankine cycle system.” This application was assigned to the Company. There can be no assurance that these patents will be issued or maintained.

In late 2010, we began filing several provisional patents covering our new organic pressure-driven cycle technology. In January 2011, we hired the inventor of this technology, Keith Johnson, as a specialist in advanced pressure-driven systems. He has assigned to PowerVerde his patent application in this field, U.S. Patent Application 61/424,249 filed on December 17, 2010. There can be no assurance that these patents will be issued or maintained.
 
Pursuant to the Cornerstone acquisition, we acquired all rights to U.S. Patent Application No. 12,749,416 filed on March 29, 2010, entitled “Solar Photovoltaic Closed Fluid Loop Evaporation Tower.” This application was filed by Bryce Johnson as inventor and assigned to Cornerstone in connection with the acquisition. There can be no assurance that this patent will be issued or maintained.
 
On June 25, 2015, our consultant Hank Leibowitz assigned to PowerVerde his U.S. Patent Application No. 62/172,616, filed on June 8, 2015 for “a system and method using high temperature sources [such as gas well flaring] in Rankine cycle power systems.” There can be no assurance that this patent, which we expect to use in connection with our WSC system, will be issued or maintained. We have agreed to pay Mr. Leibowitz a 2% royalty for any and all revenues of products and/or project sales by us based on this patent.
 
Government Regulations and Incentives
 
Regulatory proposals to limit greenhouse gases remain under consideration, particularly in Europe. One such measure would be a carbon tax placed on fuels in proportion to their carbon content. Another would be a tax on oil. Yet another would be a “cap and trade” system. All of these would drive up the price of electricity from fossil fuel sources, yet have no impact on carbon-free renewable sources such as those offered by us; however, due to economic conditions in the United States and Europe and strong political opposition, in particular from the current US presidential administration, there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be implemented.
 
Governments, utilities, businesses, and consumers alike are acutely aware of the negative effects of pollution and use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuel-based emissions contribute to serious health and environmental conditions such as acid rain, particulate pollution, nitrogen deposition, and global climate change. Consequently, government agencies in the United States and Europe at the national, state/provincial and local levels have implemented and proposed various economic incentives in the form of tax credits, rebates, deductions, accelerated depreciation and other subsidies designed to enhance the use of energy-efficient and clean power sources. We believe that these incentives will have a substantial positive impact on demand for the PowerVerde systems; however, there can be no assurance that, even with these incentives, our systems will be economically competitive or that the incentives will continue to be available.
 
We have applied and continue to apply for federal grants, loans and/or other programs designed to assist development of renewable “green” energy sources, and we have previously retained specialized consultants to assist in this endeavor; however, we have not been successful in these ongoing efforts, and there can be no assurance that we will ever receive any governmental assistance.

Competition
 
We face substantial competition from numerous other companies, most of whom have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Our competition is worldwide, ranging from solo inventors and small businesses all the way to major utility companies and multinational corporations, all of whom are attempting to design, develop and market clean and efficient methods for the generation and delivery of electricity. This competition is expected to increase due to pressures arising from environmental concerns and the increased availability of governmental incentives and subsidies. These competitors may prove more successful in offering similar products and/or may offer alternative products which prove superior in performance and/or more popular with potential customers than our products. Our ability to commercialize our products and grow and achieve profitability in accordance with our business plan will depend on our ability to satisfy our customers and withstand increasing competition by providing high-quality products at reasonable prices. We also face substantial competition from sustained low prices for oil and natural gas. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain a successful competitive position.
Where You Can Find Additional Information
 
The Company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. The Company files with, or furnishes to, the SEC quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports and will furnish its proxy statement. These filings are available free of charge on the Company’s website, www.powerverdeenergy.com shortly after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
 
The SEC maintains an Internet website, www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers.
 
Risks Related to General Economic Conditions
 
Increases in interest rates, or tightening of the supply of capital in the volatile global financial markets, could make it difficult for end-users to finance the cost of a PowerVerde system and could reduce the demand for our products and/or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for our products.
 
We believe that, in the event that we are able to commercialize our products, many of our end-users will depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase and install a PowerVerde system. As a result, increases in interest rates, which are expected to continue for the next 12 months due to announced Federal Reserve policy, could make it difficult for our end-users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install PowerVerde systems on favorable terms, or at all and thus lower demand and reduce our net sales. Due to the overall economic outlook, our end-users may change their decision or change the timing of their decision to purchase and install PowerVerde systems. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end-users will install PowerVerde systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in PowerVerde systems, or make alternative investments more attractive relative to PowerVerde systems, and, in each case, could cause these end-users to seek alternative investments. A reduction in the supply of project debt financing or equity investments could reduce the number of our projects that receive financing and thus lower demand for PowerVerde systems.
 
Reduced growth in or the reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives and other support for renewable energy-sourced electricity applications could reduce demand for our systems.
 
Reduced growth in or the reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives and other support for renewable-sourced electricity may result in the diminished competitiveness of our systems relative to conventional and non-renewable sources of energy, and could materially and adversely affect our business.
 
6


Electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams. Reduced growth in or the reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for renewable electricity generation applications, especially those in our target markets, could impede our sales efforts and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of our renewable electricity generation systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our systems.
 
The market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States and in a number of other countries, these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future. These regulations and policies could deter end-user purchases of our systems. The new US presidential administration is generally skeptical of government support for the alternative energy industry, and this policy change from the prior administration may materially adversely affect our business.
 
We anticipate that our systems and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering and related matters. It is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems may result in significant additional expenses to us and our potential customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our systems.
 
Risks Related to Our Business
 
We need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our business.
 
We will need to raise promptly substantial additional funds. Without such additional funds, we may have to cease operations. We will require substantial additional funding for our contemplated research and development activities, commercialization of our products and ordinary operating expenses. Adequate funds for these purposes may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. Insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back our activities or to cease operations. Our sole source of material revenues has been Biotech IP licensing fees. Our license agreement expired in March 2018, when the underlying patents expired, and our final royalty payment, for royalties accrued in the first quarter of 2018, was received in the second quarter of 2018.
 
We face substantial competition in our industry, and we may be unable to attract customers and maintain a viable business.
 
We face substantial competition from numerous other companies, most of whom have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Our competition is worldwide, ranging from solo inventors and small businesses all the way to major utility companies and multinational corporations, all of whom are attempting to design, develop and market clean and efficient methods for the generation and delivery of electricity. This competition is expected to increase due to pressures arising from high prices of fossil fuels, environmental concerns and the availability of governmental incentives and subsidies. These competitors may prove more successful in offering similar products and/or may offer alternative products which prove superior in performance and/or more popular with potential customers than our products. Our ability to commercialize our products and grow and achieve profitability in accordance with our business plan will depend on our ability to satisfy our customers and withstand increasing competition by providing high-quality products at reasonable prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain a successful competitive position.
 
7


Our success is dependent on the services of our key management and personnel.
 
Our success will depend in large part upon the skill and efforts of our key personnel hired or who may be hired, including our chief engineer, Hank Leibowitz, and our system specialist, Mark Prinz. Loss of any such personnel, whether due to resignation, death, and disability or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, Mr. Leibowitz does not intend to work for PowerVerde on a full-time basis, as he has substantial other business activities. He intends to dedicate the time he deems appropriate to meet PowerVerde’s needs; however, there can be no assurance that he will be willing or able to dedicate such time and attention as would maximize PowerVerde’s chances for success.
 
We have a limited operating history.
 
We have only a limited operating history. We have yet to generate any material revenues from our systems, as we have sold only one system, in a discounted 2011 sale to a former European distributor, and the commercial value of our products is uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable. Further, we are subject to all the risks inherent in a new business including, but not limited to: intense competition; lack of sufficient capital; loss of protection of proprietary technology and trade secrets; difficulties in commercializing its products, managing growth and hiring and retaining key employees; adverse changes in costs and general business and economic conditions; and the need to achieve product acceptance, to enter and develop new markets and to develop and maintain successful relationships with customers, third party suppliers and contractors.
 
We may have difficulty in protecting our intellectual property and may incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in patent infringement litigation.
 
We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary technology, which is our principal asset.
 
Our ability to compete effectively will depend to a large extent on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad. There can be no assurance that (i) any patents that we have applied or apply for will be issued, (ii) any patents issued, including our existing U.S. Patent No. 6,840,151, on which our current products are based, will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, (iii) that we will have the financial resources to enforce our patents or (iv) the patent rights granted will provide any competitive advantage. We could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting our patent rights, including those granted by third parties, and we might not be able to afford such expenditures.
 
We have limited protection over our trade secrets and know-how.
 
Although we have entered into confidentiality and invention agreements with our key personnel, there can be no assurance that these agreements will be honored or that we will be able to protect our rights to our non-patented trade secrets and know-how effectively. There can be no assurance that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
 
8


We may be unable to obtain required licenses from third-parties for product development.
 
We may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties. If we do not obtain required licenses, we could encounter delays in product development or find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring these licenses could be prevented.
 
The reduction, elimination or unavailability of contemplated government incentives may force our business plan to be changed and may materially adversely affect our business.
 
Our business plan relies to a significant extent on the availability of substantial federal, state and local governmental incentives for the development, production and purchase of energy-saving, environmentally-friendly products such as our systems. These incentives include, among others, tax deductions, tax credits, rebates, accelerated depreciation and government loans, grants and other subsidies. There can be no assurance that some or all of these incentives will not be substantially reduced or eliminated, nor can there be any assurance that any currently proposed incentives will actually take effect. Similarly, we have never received, and there can be no assurance that we will ever receive, any government loans, grants or other subsidies.
 
Lower energy prices may hinder our ability to attract customers and become profitable.
 
Our products are energy-efficient electric generators which compete primarily with conventional fossil fuel-generated electricity produced and delivered by conventional utility companies. The significant decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas in recent years have materially adversely affected our competitive position. If sustained, these lower fossil fuel prices and the corresponding lower cost of fossil fuel-generated electricity could materially adversely affect our business.
 
We may be unable to purchase materials and parts on commercially reasonable terms from suppliers.
 
If we are able to commercialize our systems, our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to obtain a reliable supply of materials and parts from our suppliers on commercially reasonable terms. This may not prove possible due to competition, inflation, shortages, international crises, adverse economic and political conditions and business failures of suppliers or other reasons.
 
Our insurance may not provide adequate coverage.
 
Although we maintain general and product liability, property and commercial crime insurance coverage which we consider prudent, there can be no assurance that such insurance will prove adequate in the event of actual casualty losses or broader calamities such as terrorist attacks, earthquakes, financial crises, economic depressions or other catastrophic events, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on PowerVerde.
 
We may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance for our commercial products.
 
The design, development and manufacture of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain insurance for any of our proposed commercial products. Such insurance is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all. We are also exposed to product liability claims in the event the use of our proposed products result in injury.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock; Liquidity Risks
 
Our stock price is highly volatile.
 
The market prices for securities of emerging and development stage companies such as ours have historically been highly volatile, and our limited history has reflected this volatility. Difficulty in raising capital as well as future announcements concerning us or our competitors, including the results of testing, technological innovations or new commercial products, government regulations, developments concerning proprietary rights, litigation or public concern as to safety of potential products developed by us or others, may have a significant adverse impact on the market price of our stock.
 
We do not pay dividends on our common stock, and we have no intention to do so in the future.
 
For the near-term, we intend to retain remaining future earnings, if any, to finance our operations and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends with respect to our common stock.
 
There has been limited trading in our stock.
 
Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCBB under the symbol “PWVI.” Since our February 2008 Merger with our predecessor Vyrex Corporation, our stock has been thinly traded, and no assurance can be given as to when, if ever, an active trading market will develop or, if developed, that it will be sustained. As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at a fair price, if at all.
 
We may issue additional shares of our stock which may dilute the value of our stock.
 
Shares which we issue pursuant to private placements generally may be sold in the public market after they have been held for six months, pursuant to Rule 144. The sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market under Rule 144 or otherwise could materially adversely affect the prevailing market prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities.
 
We may issue shares of preferred stock that could defer a change of control or dilute the interests of holders of our common stock shareholders.
 
Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the power to establish the dividend rates, liquidation preferences, voting rights, redemption and conversion terms and privileges with respect to any series of preferred stock. The issuance of any series of preferred stock having rights superior to those of the common stock may result in a decrease in the value or market price of the common stock and further, they could be used by the Board of Directors as a device to prevent a change in control favorable to the Company. Holders of preferred stock to be issued in the future may have the right to receive dividends and certain preferences in liquidation and conversion rights. The issuance of such preferred stock could make the possible takeover of the Company or the removal of management of the Company more difficult, and adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holder of the common stock, or depress the market price of the common stock.

Our common stock is covered by SEC “penny stock” rules which may make it more difficult for you to sell or dispose of our common stock.
 
Since we have net tangible assets of less than $1,000,000, transactions in our securities are subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by this Rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, this Rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.
 
The Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any non-NASDAQ equity security of a small company that has a market price (as therein defined) less than $5.00 per share, or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share subject to certain exceptions, and which is not traded on any exchange or quoted on NASDAQ. For any transaction by broker-dealers involving a penny stock (unless exempt), the rules require delivery, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about compensation payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in an account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
