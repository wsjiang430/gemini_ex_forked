ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History

On June 22, 2017, The Coretec Group Inc. (the “Group” or the “Company”) filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma to change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.”, which became effective on June 29, 2017.
 
The Group, formerly known as 3DIcon Corporation, was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Prior to September 30, 2016, the day we closed a transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (as defined below), the Group’s primary activity had been the raising of capital in order to pursue its goal of becoming a significant participant in the development, commercialization and marketing of next generation 3D display technologies.

On September 30, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), we closed a transaction contemplated by a Share Exchange Agreement dated May 31, 2016 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Coretec, and four Coretec members (the “Members”), which Members held all outstanding membership interests in Coretec. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Coretec became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, and the Group issued an aggregate 15,870 post-split shares of the Group’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the Members, resulting in their collective beneficial ownership of approximately 65% of the Group’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis, which shares were subject to a one-year lock up agreement. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into 1,914 shares, or an aggregate of 30,374,363 post-shares of common stock. Since the parties agreed and acknowledged that such conversion shares were not available for issuance, the Group agreed to take action to proceed in good faith to cause a corporate action that allowed the Group to issue such conversion shares (the “Capitalization Adjustment”). In the event that the Capitalization Adjustment was not completed by May 30, 2017, the Members had an option, but not the obligation, to rescind the Share Exchange Agreement by surrendering for cancellation all consideration paid by the Group and the Group returning all membership interests in Coretec. The Capitalization Adjustment was completed on June 28, 2017 with the completion of a reverse stock split and the Share Exchange Agreement was not rescinded.
 
Background of the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
As discussed above, on the Closing Date, we closed a transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which Coretec became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. Coretec was organized on June 2, 2015 in the state of North Dakota. It is currently developing, testing, and providing new and/or improved technologies, products, and service solutions for medical, electronic, photonic, display, and lighting markets among others. The combination of the two companies provides a significant number of opportunities to increase shareholder value by:

● | Providing technological support to advance the refinement of CSpace® image material;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Adding recognized expertise to the team; 
● | Creating the opportunity for near-term revenue; 
● | Adding a significant portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP); and 
● | Drug delivery 

 
Overview of the Consolidated Company.
 
Coretec’s Technology. Coretec’s underlying technology is based on the production of a high value liquid silicon precursor, cyclohexasilane (“CHS”). A key advantage of CHS is that it remains in liquid form at room temperature and does not convert to a gas until heated above 400°F. This compares to materials commonly used for manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors and solar cells (monosilane or trichlorosilane) that have much lower boiling points which leads to higher cost handling and shipping. Another key advantage of CHS is that the production rate of the silicon-forming step can be increased by a factor of six relative to the currently used materials, leading to significant cost savings. We anticipate that CHS will first be used as an alternative to monosilane or trichlorosilane when adding silicon to lithium ion batteries or when used in manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors.
 
We also see longer term potential in several emerging markets where there are opportunities in the conversion of CHS into nanoparticles and nanowires for use in such emerging, high-growth markets as:
 

● | Energy storage 
--+-----------------------------------------
● | Solid state lighting 
● | Authentication of critical documentation
● | Printable electronics 
● | Building-integrated solar energy

Enhancement of CSpace. A key challenge in the development of CSpace® is the development of the material used for the image chamber. The Company has explored a variety of glass alternatives. While progress has been made, it has been concluded that limitations remain, primarily in weight and cost.
 
A key virtue of having access to the Coretec IP portfolio of silicon-based materials is that we can now use all of the manufacturing infrastructure and knowledge that is available for optical plastics for the CSpace® image chamber. The benefit to CSpace® is that silicon-based optical plastics can be molded into a broad range of shapes and allow the image chamber to be much lighter and much lower in cost than the glass material we worked with before.
 
Near-Term Revenue Opportunities. Opportunities for near-term revenue continue to be explored in battery and microelectronic markets. Interest in the use of silicon in Li-ion batteries continues to increase driven by the growing demand for electrical vehicles and home energy storage systems for backup power. Discussions are ongoing with suppliers of Li-ion battery anode materials that are seeking next generation materials to further increase performance while improving lifetime, safety and reliability. We believe these suppliers will be well positioned to take advantage of the benefits provided by CHS when combined as a liquid with other powder-based materials. While we believe the use of CHS in Li-ion batteries will provide near term revenue, we also continue to explore revenue opportunities in microelectronics and especially those early adopter markets where advanced microelectronics are being developed in lower volumes and with less price sensitivity. 
Recent Developments.

As previously disclosed, in June 2016, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Coretec Industries LLC, signed an exclusive licensing agreement (the “NDSU/RF Agreement”) with the NDSU Research Foundation (“NDSU/RF”), pursuant to which the Company had sponsored North Dakota State University to provide research and to license certain technologies from August 14, 2015 to June 30, 2017. The Company was to provide compensation to NDSU/RF and NDSU/RF was to provide certain deliverables to the Corporation. However, a dispute arose between the Corporation and NDSU/RF regarding compensation and deliverables (the “Dispute”).
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company and Coretec Industries LLC (collectively, the “Coretec Parties”) entered into a settlement agreement and general release (the “Settlement Agreement”) with NDSU/RF to resolve the Dispute, pursuant to which Coretec and NDSU/RF shall fully and forever release each other from the NDSU/RF Agreement and mutually release each other of all claims in connection therewith.
 
Overview of Business
 
Coretec Business
 
Coretec Industries LLC, a North Dakota limited liability company, was established in 2015 to create technology-based solutions (products and services) that address energy-related market needs globally. Coretec was founded by three corporate entities: EOS Management LLC, Carlton James North Dakota, Ltd., and ChymaTek Energy Solutions, LLC. Principals supporting the business included Simon Calton, and Ronald Dombrowski. The principals have combined expertise in forming and managing technology-based startups, fundraising, sales, and marketing. They were advised by Ramez Elgammal, VP of Technology, an expert in silicon chemistry and Doug Freitag, Chairman of our Advisory Board, an expert in the application of Si materials and Federal business development.
 
Coretec’s business model is to identify and commercialize disruptive technologies in silicon and 3D visualization serving advanced technology markets in support of global grand challenges in health, environment, security and energy. Sources of disruptive technology are licensed technology created by major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Where technology does not already exist, research is to be sponsored and jointly developed with our customers. The initial candidates for commercialization center around CHS, and a source of this technology includes silicon technologies. CHS technologies include methods to produce and process cyclohexasilane (Si6H12), “stacked” polysilane ((R2Si)n) and their alloys with various dopants into liquid silane, Si, silicon nitride, and SiC thin films, Si nanowires and Si QDs. Future technologies will include high refractive index siloxane polymers (HRISP).
 
Coretec technology will be used to form partnerships with established manufacturers and distributors in global markets of interest. Early adoption of these technologies is anticipated in markets for battery energy storage (Li-ion), solid-state lighting (LEDs), solar energy (BIPV) and printable electronics (Asset Monitoring). These respective supply chains include material suppliers, process tool suppliers, subcomponent suppliers and OEMs. We will first form strategic partnerships with specialty material suppliers with expertise in Si. Once the supply of our materials has been established, we will form partnerships with OEMs and their suppliers in the respective markets looking for a competitive advantage we believe we can provide.

Business Model
 
Coretec’s business model includes monitoring the ever-growing catalogue of new technologies and valuable IP for licensing opportunities that could lead to incremental improvements and/or additional features in resulting products or lead to next generation products for use by energy-related industries and is created and held within universities and other parties that may lack financial resources and/or interest to further develop and commercialize them.
 
Additionally, where needs exist, but new technologies and resulting products are not currently available, conduct research and development (“R&D”) activities through sponsored projects performed at major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Coretec will leverage existing, world-class expertise, experience, and laboratory facilities that reside in these non-profit, R&D entities for R&D, testing, and “proof of concept” studies up to and including at the device level that may be required to create commercialization opportunities.
 
Following these “proof of concept studies”, commercialization opportunities (e.g., manufacturing, marketing, sales) created for its technologies and IP will include, but are not limited to:
 

● | joint ventures or other business collaborations with Coretec’s joint development partners who can manufacture, market and sell new or improved products (based upon Coretec’s technologies and IP) into existing or new supply chains (that the partner company/companies already have an established, significant presence or can capture and grow market share); or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manufacturing, marketing and selling its own products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | creating “exit strategies” such as:
--+------------------------------------


o | sale of one or more technologies and IP to the private sector;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


o | license and/or sublicense one or more technologies and IP to the private sector; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | other business transactions, e.g., merger, acquisition, spinoffs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

● | sale of Coretec’s novel silicon-based materials that improve or otherwise enhance performance of various products, e.g., Li-ion batteries, electronics, PV/solar cells, and displays and/or other optical-based devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a share of the revenue coming from the sale of jointly developed product(s) and/or from one or more joint ventures with strategic partners; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sale of technology/technologies and associated IP to joint development partners or other companies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gelest Supply Agreement
 
The Company is currently negotiating an agreement with Gelest Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“Gelest”). where Gelest will provide Cyclohexasilane (“CHS” or the “Products”) storage and handling, website and catalog listings of CHS produced by or for the Company for sale to its customers, and customer service, including trans-fill of customer cylinders. 
Competition
 
Based on our market research and competitive analysis, we have concluded that our CHS technology is unique and provides an advantage in that it should allow 1) production at high yields at low cost using readily available raw materials, 2) storage, transport and use as a liquid at room temperature 3) processing of the liquid into fibers, particles, and films that when heated forms silicon, and 4) the simple addition of dopants to the liquid at an atomic level that when heated forms doped silicon. Competing silanes provided by numerous manufacturers exist as a gas at room temperature and are explosive resulting in greater cost during storage, handling, transportation and use. Our closest competitor is cyclopentasilane which exists as a gas at room temperature and has proven costly and difficult to manufacture. Other competitors exist in specific applications. For example, graphene and carbon nanotubes are potential competitors in printable electronics but are only now emerging and require purification that is proving costly.

Coretec’s business and commercialization model is based in part upon establishing joint development partnerships with companies that are commercially successful and financially sound as well as deeply embedded in the supply chains for the aforementioned energy-related products. For example, Coretec is developing a strategic partnership with a domestic supplier of silicon-based materials that will facilitate further development and scale-up of Si6H12 plus chemical derivatives and other materials based on Si6H12. This strategic partnership will enable Coretec to supply large quantities of these novel silicon materials to those companies interested in producing prototype batteries, electronics, and PV/solar cells for testing and commercial evaluation. Coretec will continue to seek other such strategic partnerships within the private sector.
 
Company Business
 
The Company is developing a patented volumetric 3D display technology that was developed by and with the University of Oklahoma (the “University”) under a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”). The development to date has resulted in multiple new technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.
 
On May 26, 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") approved the patent called "Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display" for rendering a three-dimensional image and converted it to U.S. patent No. 7,537,345. On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the patent called “Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe the foundation of what is called CSpace® technology (“CSpace”).
 
Company Overview
 
The Company intends to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through a combination of government funded research and development contracts, joint development agreements with industry partners and technology licensing agreements for high value applications in military planning, cyber data analysis, battlespace visualization, oil and gas exploration and medical imaging.
Commercialization Strategy and Target Applications
 
The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through customer funded research and development contracts and technology licensing agreements for high value applications like air traffic control, design visualization, and medical imaging. The Company plans to develop products for contract engineering and with joint development customers. At this time the Company does not have any commercialized products and does not plan to develop its own products based on the CSpace technology due to the high value / low volume nature of the best-fit initial applications for this technology. These applications include but are not limited to the following:

● | Healthcare (diagnostics, surgical planning, training, telemedicine, biosurveillance);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyber security data visualization;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Military (operational planning, training, modeling and simulation, battlespace awareness, damage assessment, autonomous piloting);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical security (passenger, luggage & cargo screening);
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Mining, oil & gas exploration; or
--+----------------------------------


● | Meteorological and oceanographic data visualization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
Based on our market research and competitive analysis to date, we have concluded that the CSpace volumetric technology is unique and advantaged versus other 3D technologies in that it can deliver both 1) a true 360 degree viewing experience for multiple simultaneous users, and 2) high image quality, high reliability and large image size. Rear projection 3D displays such as those from Zecotek, Setred, and EuroLCDs (formerly LC Tech LightSpace) do not provide a 360-degree viewing experience and are typically limited to one or two users. Early proof of concept work done on infrared active phosphor displays by 3D Display Laboratories proved to not be scalable due to limited phosphor persistence and vector scanning limitations. While holographic and light field displays show promise, they do not deliver a true 360-degree viewing experience and cost-effective multiple user systems do not appear feasible due to current and expected pixel density, data bandwidth and compute power limitations.
