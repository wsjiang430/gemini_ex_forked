ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
MWF Global Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on November 18, 2016 and established a fiscal year end of January 31. The Company is organized to sell unique country specific handcrafted natural products with a focus on sourcing these products from South-East Asia and offering these products for sale through the Company’s web site and to establish other distribution channels. 
 
The Company’s website (www.mwfglobal.com) has been launched with minimal sales to date. It is the Company’s intention to provide its customers with quality unique handcrafted natural products with a focus on products manufactured in Southeast Asia. The first proposed product to market are Caraboa Horn belts made from water buffalo horns and manufactured in the Philippines. The Company’s target market are consumers who are looking for eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable products. We intend to deploy current electronic marketing activities such as Search Engine Optimizations (“SEO”), internet online and social media advertising. 
 
The Company intends to focus on the selling of unique handcrafted natural products with a focus on products manufactured in Southeast Asia via our proposed on-line store. Our initial proposed product which we will purchase from a supplier of Caraboa Horn Belts made from water buffalo horns and manufactured in the Philippines. Carabao is the native Filipino word meaning water buffalo. Our principal supplier will be “Kings Apparel”, located in Cebu City, Philippines. The Caraboa Horn belts are created from water buffalo horns. The water buffaloes are not slaughtered for their horns. As the horns grow they may cause the animals discomfort. The horns are simply trimmed and not wasted. The trimmed horns can be used for a variety of uses including creating on-of-a-kind belts. We intend to sell products that are unique, environmentally sustainable. The Company has targeted the growing trend of consumers who are looking for products that environmentally friendly and renewable.
 
There is the likelihood that we may never be able to market our unique hand-crafted products beginning with the Caraboa belts and that the Company would need to successfully in its marketing efforts to complete its plan of operation and develop and implement the Company’s on-line retail web-site. If our Company is not capable of building a market for its proposed product, all funds that we spend on development will be lost.
 
During the next 12 months, MWF GLOBAL INC. intends to continue its ongoing research to find and secure suppliers of unique handcrafted natural products with a focus on products from Southeast Asia. The first product we intend to offer is Carabao Horn Belts (made from water buffalo horns) from the Philippines. The Company has identified a supplier, (Kings Apparel, located in Cebu City, Philippines), for Carabao belts. We secured our domain name (mwfglobal.com); completed development of a unique logo and on-line presence for our proposed product. We will also source a third-party firm to ship out our product until fully operational the Company will ship the product; and have launched our website “www.mwfglobal.com” and customers can process payments through our website via Shopify. The Company has access to product directly from the supplier and can supply product directly from the supplier during the web-site testing period prior to the Company stocking inventory. We expect to begin to market our proposed product via the internet and social media. We have not yet commenced any marketing activities including social media marketing.
