These include accounting firms, certified public accountants (“CPA's”), bookkeeping businesses, estate planners, lawyers, wealth management consultants, estate offices, private offices, banks, and large financial institutions. However, many of these firms are either too big to provide the customized services that small business owners are seeking, are too expensive, or simply do not have the customized services that Financial Gravity offers to meet the needs of small business owners and high net worth individuals.
