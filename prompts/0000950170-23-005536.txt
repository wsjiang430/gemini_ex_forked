Our mailing address is 901 Explorer Boulevard, Huntsville, Alabama, 35806. Our telephone number at that location is (800) 923-8726. Our website is www.adtran.com. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.
 Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement
 The DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company, which was executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023 as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).
 Under the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company isentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net loss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of ADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit generated, if any, in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the Company to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first time to the loss generated, if any, in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.
 

Additionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides that ADVA shareholders (other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a compensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the “Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax regime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual Recurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA in 2024.
The adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led appraisal proceedings under German law, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA.
The opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).
 We currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February 14, 2023.
 The foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a non-binding English translation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs. We expect to incur integration costs and costs associated with our performance under the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected to be material.

Industry Overview
 The global growth of cloud and mobility, home office and mobile working, industrial applications and 5G are accelerating the demand for more bandwidth, requiring more flexible provisioning of telecommunications services and more precise network synchronization. Unprecedented levels of investment by communications service providers in their networks is being driven by the pursuit of growth in subscriber acquisition, retention, and average revenue per user, alongside the streamlining of operations to reduce operational costs and complexity, while lowering energy consumption and improving their overall ESG position. Drivers facilitating this network investment cycle include the evolution of government funding programs, private equity infrastructure investment appetite, regulatory broadband policies, competition, merger obligations and ever-increasing subscriber demand for higher speed broadband.
 Subscriber demand for greater bandwidth continues to increase as connectivity is being woven ever more tightly into the fabric of everyone’s day-to-day lives. Increasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, the transition of entertainment over to OTT video, along with the evolution of gaming towards subscription models where new hybrids of download and streaming are emerging globally. This is further compounded with the prevalence of IoT and the increasing transition of applications over to cloud-based services and internet applications where recurring revenues replace one-time sales. Performance and user satisfaction are directly related to bandwidth availability and service robustness. As the demand for high-definition video and game streaming services, symmetric bandwidth for online collaboration, ever lower latency for interactive cloud applications and smart home video surveillance applications continue to increase, so too does the need for fiber-based broadband to every home, business and location of socioeconomic activity.
 In order to satisfy these complex requirements and deliver on the efficiency improvements demanded by operators, communications service providers are transitioning to full fiber access networks. This transition has created an unprecedented market opportunity where the comprehensive replacement of copper and coaxial networks along with the equipment that enables broadband over them, opens what has historically been a stagnant market to an entirely new wave of fresh competition.
 This new market entrance opportunity is further enhanced by shifts in the geopolitical landscape alongside architectural evolutions. Several vendors that once dominated the European and other markets have found themselves classified on the high-risk vendor register where resistance is increasingly emerging about their use in national network infrastructures. This further levels the playing field for the remaining vendor community. In their pursuit of efficiency, operators are embracing new architectures, reflecting those used throughout the web scale industry by the hyper-scalers. This is resulting in an additional inflection point where traditional access network equipment architectures are coming under increasing scrutiny about their longevity, efficiency and scalability.
 We aim to serve as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we assist them with maximizing the performance of their networks by providing a flexible path for their networks to evolve cost effectively over to full fiber while availing themselves of the benefits that web scale architectures deliver and helping to further monetize their investments.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for our customers that enable them to address their increasing broadband demand. Our solutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business CPE and software platforms, and services needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. ADVA’s technology complements ADTRAN’s portfolio and significantly expands the solutions set we can offer to our customers, helping them in their quest to enable the rapidly advancing digitalization of ecosystems around the world. Optical networking technology provides the scalable transmission capacity needed to handle bandwidth growth. Cloud access solutions allow the flexible and fast deployment of new communication services including state-of-the-art edge computing solutions, and the synchronization technology ensures maximum performance in the network.
 We aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and the innovation leader around the converged edge, enabling the intelligent, self-optimizing, fiber-everywhere future. We plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and business technology paired with a customer-focused organizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target customers. ADTRAN has one of the most comprehensive solutions portfolios that empowers operators to build a converged infrastructure from the metro core to the customer premise, serving all networking applications for residential, business, wholesale and mobile users. We take an approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific markets where we can offer competitive differentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity solutions that offer value to our customers. More specifically, our corporate strategy consists of the following elements:
 •Leadership in fiber networking: Breadth of portfolio, open and advanced architecture, assured and secure connectivity. 
 •Growth in focus markets: More turnkey solutions and in-region resources, especially North America and EMEA. 
 •Investment in converged edge: Innovation in optics, security, AI-driven networking, virtualization, SaaS, etc.
 •Transformation through software: Open and cloud-centric systems, end-to-end programmability, simplification through software, and innovative SaaS offerings.
 

•Diversification of customers: Cross-selling current portfolio, acquisition of new customers and partners based on larger portfolio and trusted supplier status. 
 •Focus on sustainability: Science-based emissions targets, process-based product eco-design, optimization of operations, logistics and all packaging, circular-economy processes.
 Customers
 We have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval before the purchase or installation of a product. The nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.
 One service provider customer individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. Additionally, our revenue in the U.S., U.K. and Germany comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. The revenue from this service provider and these countries is reported in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments.
 For a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Distribution, Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in domestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.
 Before placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or even years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume commitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition based on some combination of total value, service, price, delivery and other terms.
 Orders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major accounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be affiliated with us as channel partners, or they may purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to receive benefits such as product discounts, market development funds, technical support and training.
 Outside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution arrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and support functions, and in some cases, warehousing and manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and customer support groups.
 

Our marketing organization promotes all brands associated with us to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world. Marketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams to develop and promote new products and services, as well as product enhancements.
 Research and Development
 Rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, supply constraints and continuing developments in communications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market demand is the main factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.
 Our product development activities are a central part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering functions are global. We maintain research and development functions at multiple sites in the U.S., Europe, Israel and Asia. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, research and development expenditures totaled $173.8 million, $108.7 million and $113.3 million, respectively.
 We develop the majority of our products internally, and we also leverage partners for some solutions. Additionally, we license intellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-class solutions for our customers.
 As we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development ensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher quality and more economically to our customers and the market on a continuous basis.
 Our ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product development efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, enabling us to offer products at competitive prices and compete for market share. In 2022, we again encountered supply chain disruptions and component shortages, which resulted in us re-engineering many of our products to work around component availability and end of life issues. See Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our supply chain disruptions.
 Development activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet and Optical network architectures. This includes optical transport, packet demarcation and aggregation, synchronization and fiber-optic access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access, converged services, VoIP, network management and professional services. In addition, we focus on vertical optical technologies like Silicon Photonics, as well as microelectronics in order to differentiate and fully control the vertical value stack of our solutions. In 2022, we released many market-leading products like additions to our SDX OLT range, new residential gateway and ONT families, outdoor packet demarcation devices, 100G packet demarcation, encryption/security products, 800G transport solutions and the unique Optical Cesium based atomic clocks. Furthermore, we enhanced our SaaS delivery abilities and Mosaic One software.
 Our research function and advanced technology team is driving many specific research projects in the fields of sustainable optical transmission, security, quantum communications, SDN and access technologies. It fosters differentiated product concepts and guides our various product design and engineering teams in IPR creation, industry and network standards and technological forecasting.
 We are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.
 Our SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access, optical networking and synchronization. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI, ONF and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies on next-generation PON. We also continue to be involved in driving optical networking, synchronization and SDN standardization and participate in industry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects related to those standards in e.g. BBF and ONF. We are also members of MEF, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.
 For a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 


Manufacturing and Operations
 The principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping. We purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we manage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve manufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key components are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has resulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and building long-term relationships with our suppliers. With the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue to ease during 2023. See Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
 We rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to purchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume, higher-mix products and build and test product prototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix assemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to uncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have generally proven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.
We ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama and Norcross, Georgia. The majority of international customers are being served from our logistics hubs in Meiningen, Germany and York, United Kingdom. We also ship directly from subcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.
 Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.
 For a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

 For further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Seasonality
 We experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue that occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual capital spending budgets. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or operating results. Additionally, the effects of the dynamic supply and demand environment we have experienced in recent periods may impact the traditional seasonality in our business.
Foreign Currency
 Transactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the Euro and the British pound sterling. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
Inventory
 A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. However, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations and our financial condition.
We have seen increased demand for our products due to the Business Combination with ADVA, increased volume of sales activity to service provider customers and as a result of customer strategies designed to mitigate supply constraints and assure access to needed products. To meet this demand, we have enhanced and implemented supply chain management systems and processes to manage the materials planning and production processes. We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. In the current environment, our raw material inventory has grown due to increased purchases in preparation for strategic inventory buffer purchases as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to COVID-19 uncertainties related to supply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business and ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to


assure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete inventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.
 For further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 

Government Regulation
 Our products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain international bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we amend our products to comply with these requirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply with these and other similar directives and regulations from additional countries.
 We strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance achievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend network reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards for quality and environmental management systems. We strive to ensure that our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU residents, and to other applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 For further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.”
 Environmental, Social, and Governance
 We believe that as we follow our corporate vision to enable a fully connected world, we must continue to be responsible corporate citizens. As more people are connected, work and life can be accomplished using fewer resources. We have established ESG and Sustainability programs and policies that encompass the elements of Environmental, Health & Safety, Ethics, Labor, and Management Systems in alignment with the ISO 26000 Guidelines. We are committed to operating in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all the countries in which we operate. The major aims of our program are eliminating waste and emissions, maximizing energy efficiency and productivity and minimizing practices that can adversely affect utilization of natural resources by coming generations. Our ESG programs are important to us. ESG is a dedicated focus throughout the company. We have Board oversight including an ESG Committee, strong management support and engagement from our employees.
 Areas of focus in our environmental sustainability program include:
 •established an ESG Committee of the Board of Directors;
 •maintained our mature environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 from 2006;
 •advanced our Energy Management program where we have continually set targets for reduced energy and water consumption since 2005;
 •continued investment in Wind Renewable Energy Credits;

ESG Report
 Due to certain regulations, proceedings of the merger and the operations of ADTRAN and ADVA during 2022 there will be separate reports published for the two organizations. These ESG reports provide additional information regarding ADTRAN Holding’s ESG program. Within the report is information on our environmental programs, initiatives related to our people and our community. This information can be found on our website at: www.adtran.com/en/about-us/esg/environmental. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.
 Human Capital
 We believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure we continue to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and retain top talent. Our ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that provides opportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by competitive compensation and benefits, along with strong community service and other programs that enable employees to build connections within the community.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,307 full-time employees, with 1,417 in the U.S. and 1,890 in our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC regions. 1,948 of these full-time employees are employees of ADVA and its subsidiaries. We also utilized 177 contractors and numerous temporary employees domestically and internationally in various manufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We have a diverse employee base located in 37 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority of our employees serve in engineering, information technology and technical roles within the organization.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 170 employees (75%) of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements of either the Association of Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Although these collective bargaining agreements will expire on September 30, 2024, negotiations with the employees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are ongoing and we have not experienced any work stoppage. As of December 31, 2022, ADVA had 85 employees in Switzerland, France, Italy, Finland and Spain that were subject to collective bargaining agreements of different associations. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
 Additionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This program seeks to identify college students that major in relevant technological areas and expose them to our work environment on an alternating semester basis. Our goal is to retain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation building our organization's future.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. We encourage an environment where individuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and perspective and where each employee is accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work.
In addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender, race and ethnicity. Our Board of Directors is comprised of nine members, three of which are females and three of which are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 The well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our employees' health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable them and their family members to have affordable access to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying incident, including accident insurance, life insurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of our employees’ wellbeing. As a result, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides access to qualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.
 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with, or exceed, local, state and federal recommendations and regulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having our global employees work from home, hybrid or on-site. In areas where it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our manufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been implemented to provide the safest environment possible for these workers.
 Compensation and Benefits
 We continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity incentive awards with certain vesting requirements, deferred compensation plans (which are offered to certain members of executive management), a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our global headquarters in Alabama, we offer our employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.
Talent Development
 We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We offer numerous training opportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We utilize tools and processes to provide performance feedback which helps develop high potential employees into becoming our future leaders.
 Our Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides opportunities for employees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design and systems thinking. As employees increase their competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this program offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have access to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform houses all required training, as well as optional training in a variety of areas.
 Intellectual Property
 ADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 1,000 patents worldwide related to our products and over 50 additional pending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2023 and 2041. We continue to seek additional patents related to our research and development activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.
 The ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ours, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and names. We also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.
 We protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive success will not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
 The communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and may continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement claims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
 For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
