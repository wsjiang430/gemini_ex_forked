Overview
Equinix, Inc. connects more than 9,800 companies directly to their customers and partners across the world's most interconnected data center and interconnection platform. Platform Equinix® combines a global footprint of state-of-the-art International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data centers, a variety of interconnection solutions, unique business and digital ecosystems and expert support. Today, businesses leverage the Equinix interconnection platform in 52 strategic markets across the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). Equinix operates as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes ("REIT"). 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2018, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the United States ("U.S."), Canada, Japan, and the data center operations in EMEA with the exception of Bulgaria, United Arab Emirates and a portion of Turkey. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs").
Careful, steady expansion has been key to Equinix's growth strategy since our founding, as we seek to offer our customers interconnection opportunities ahead of demand. In April 2018, Equinix purchased the 1.6 million-square foot Infomart Building™ in Dallas, including its operations and tenants, where we had already been operating four Equinix data centers. In the same month, we closed our acquisition of Australian data center provider Metronode and its 10 data centers.
In September 2018, Equinix named Charles Meyers President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Meyers also joined Equinix's Board of Directors. Meyers succeeded Peter Van Camp, who had served as interim CEO since January 2018. Upon Meyers' appointment as CEO, Van Camp resumed his role as Executive Chairman of the Equinix Board of Directors, a position he has held since 2005. Meyers joined Equinix in 2010 as President, Equinix Americas, leading our most profitable region through a time of significant growth and strong operating performance. Meyers then served as the Chief Operating Officer at Equinix, where he led the Global Sales, Marketing, Operations and Customer Success teams. For the past year, he was President, Strategy, Services and Innovation (SSI) leading Equinix's strategic business teams including Corporate Strategy, Technology Innovation, Product Management and Engineering. Under Meyers' leadership, SSI worked to optimize our position as a cloud enabler, identify key growth areas, and evolve our offerings in response to market, competitive and technology trends.
Industry Background
The internet is a collection of numerous independent networks interconnected to form a network of networks. Users on different networks communicate with each other through interconnection between these networks. For example, when a person sends an email to someone who uses a different provider for his or her connectivity (e.g. Comcast versus AT&T), the email must pass from one network to the other to get to its final destination. A data center provides a physical point at which that interconnection can occur.
3

To accommodate the rapid growth of internet traffic that was occurring in the early years of the internet, an organized approach for network interconnection was needed. This was the start of the network era, when networks gained mutual advantage by exchanging data traffic on interoperable platforms. The exchange of traffic between these networks became known as peering, which is when networks agree to trade traffic at relatively equal amounts, often at no charge to the other party. At first, government and nonprofit organizations established places where these networks could peer with each other. These points were known as network access points, or NAPs. Over time, many NAPs became a natural extension of carrier services and were run by companies such as MFS (now a part of Verizon Business), Sprint, Ameritech and Pacific Bell (the latter two now part of AT&T).
Ultimately, these NAPs were unable to scale with the growth of the internet, and the lack of "neutrality" by the carrier owners of these NAPs created a conflict of interest with the participants. This created a market need for network-neutral interconnection points that could accommodate the rapidly growing demand to increase performance for enterprise and consumer users of the internet, especially with the rise of important content providers such as AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo! and others. In addition, the providers, as well as a growing number of enterprises, required a more secure and reliable solution for direct connection to a variety of telecommunications networks, as the importance of their internet operations continued to grow. These were the seeds of the connected era, when peering expanded exponentially among new players, and access to information anytime and anywhere became the norm.
To accommodate internet traffic growth, the largest networks left the NAPs and began connecting and trading traffic by placing private circuits between each other. Peering, which once occurred at the NAP locations, was moved to these private circuits. Over the years, these circuits became expensive to expand and could not be built quickly enough to accommodate traffic growth. This led to a need by the large carriers to find a more efficient way to peer. The multi-tenant or colocation data center was introduced to meet this need. Today, many customers satisfy their requirements for peering through data center providers like Equinix because this strategy permits them to peer with the networks within one location, using simple, direct and secure connections. Their ability to peer within a data center or across a data center campus, instead of across a metro area, has increased the scalability of their operations while decreasing network costs.
The interconnection model has further evolved over the years to include new offerings, as the collaborative landscape of the interconnected era imposes new demands for connectivity that facilitates more scalable interactive and real-time digital interconnections. Enterprises are becoming increasingly interdependent and cloud- and digital-enabled, and to compete they need real-time data exchange and reliable, instant connections between and across any given digital ecosystem. Starting with the peering and network communities, interconnection has been used for new network solutions, including carrier Ethernet, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and mobile services, in addition to traditional international private line and voice services. The data center industry is working to keep up with the rapid digital transformation of today's businesses, and it continues to evolve with a set of new network offerings (such as SDN, blockchain and 5G) where interconnection is often used to solve any challenge using both physical and virtual networks, across geographic boundaries.
In addition, the enterprise customer segment is also evolving. In the past, most enterprises opted to keep their data center requirements in-house. However, current trends are leading more enterprise chief information officers (CIOs) to either outsource their data center requirements, and/or extend their corporate wide area networks (WANs) into carrier-neutral colocation facilities where there are dense ecosystems of network, cloud and IT service providers, and business partners that enterprises can directly and securely interact with in real-time. 
The following are macro, technology and regulatory trends that are forcing enterprises and service providers across all industries to rethink their IT architectures to decrease complexity and cost, and seize new opportunities to compete successfully as digital businesses:

• | Digital business transformation is becoming a global phenomenon. According to IDC, by 2021 at least 50% of global GDP will be digitized, and growth in every industry will be driven by digitally enhanced offerings, operations and relationships. Interconnection becomes a key building block for digital business along that journey because real-time interactions between people, things, locations, clouds and data are critical in a digital age.


• | Urbanization is increasing in the majority of metros worldwide. Today, about 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, and that will grow to 68% by 2050, according to the United Nations. With so many people so close together, digital services must be increasingly concentrated and close to users, so companies can deliver the connectivity their users expect. Interconnection brings applications, data, content and networking into proximity in these densely populated areas. It allows companies to deliver on their service promises, even as demand keeps growing.

4


• | Cybersecurity has increased in frequency, scope and complexity in our more closely connected world. In fact, a large-scale cybersecurity breach is one of the most serious risks facing companies today. Ernst & Young projects the global cost of cybersecurity breaches will reach $6.0 trillion by 2021. Companies need to strengthen their defenses, even as they increase their vulnerability by distributing their data across a variety of sources and users. To do that, businesses need their security controls to be distributed as well, leveraging interconnection out at the edge where most traffic exchange is happening. The direct, private nature of interconnection also increases data protection and lowers the risk of being compromised.


• | Data Compliance has become a mandate among businesses around the world. The digital economy may be global, but more countries are regulating the data at the heart of the digital economy and prescribing enhanced rules around personal data protections (e.g., GDPR). But remaining compliant is about more than following the rules. In a Thompson Reuters survey, 69% of respondents said successful compliance efforts can drive up business efficiency and effectiveness by enabling greater focus on value-added activities. The need to address compliance drives interconnection because it enables companies to link their data storage, analytics and clouds in the same business region. That data can stay proximate, and local if required by regulations, but still be accessed globally to meet business requirements.


• | Business Ecosystems are becoming the life-blood of digital business. Gartner predicts that by 2021, the number of organizations using a mix of intermediaries will more than double, and that active engagement by these organizations with industries in ecosystems outside their native industry will nearly triple. The reason is that digital trade flows are creating global business and data processes that involve an increasing variety of customers, partners and employees. Interconnection securely and efficiently connects all the players in all these business ecosystems, as those ecosystems expand in depth and number.

Other trends that we see impacting our customers' IT strategies include:

• | The need for businesses and organizations to create a "digital edge" - where commerce, population centers and digital ecosystems meet. A more geographically distributed IT infrastructure is needed to support the digital operations that now cover every global region and every aspect of today's global businesses.


• | The growth of "proximity communities" that rely on immediate physical colocation and interconnection with strategic partners and customers. Examples include financial exchange ecosystems for electronic trading and settlement, media and content provider ecosystems, and ecosystems for real-time bidding and fulfillment of internet advertising.


• | The Internet of Things (IoT), big data infrastructures, artificial intelligence (AI) and the emergence of 5G high-speed mobile and wireless networks, which are creating unprecedented quantities of data that fuel digital business.


• | The accelerating adoption and ubiquitous nature of cloud computing technology services, in particular hybrid/multiclouds, along with enterprise cloud service offerings such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and security and disaster recovery services.


• | The continuing growth of consumer internet traffic from new bandwidth-intensive services (e.g., video, voice over IP, social media, mobile data, gaming, data-rich media), Ethernet and wireless services, as well as new devices (e.g., wearables, home assistances, AR/VR headsets). These devices and services also increase the requirements for anytime, anywhere and any device interconnection out at the edge to improve the performance, security, scalability and reliability of interconnecting people, locations, clouds, data and things.


• | Significant increases in power and cooling requirements for today's data center equipment. New generations of servers and storage devices continue to concentrate processing capability and the associated power consumption and cooling load into smaller footprints; and many legacy-built data centers are unable to accommodate these new power and cooling demands. The high capital costs associated with building and maintaining "in-sourced" data centers creates an opportunity for capital savings by leveraging an outsourced colocation model.

Industry analysts project the compound annual growth rate of the global carrier neutral colocation market to be approximately 8.4% between 2018 and 2022.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to expand our global leadership position as the premier network and cloud-neutral data center and interconnection platform for enterprises, cloud and IT services providers, media and content companies, financial services firms, IoT and big data providers, and network and mobile services providers. These are the key components of our strategy:
Improve customer performance through global interconnection.  To best succeed in today's digital economy, enterprises around the world must adopt globally interconnected, on-demand digital IT architectures. The business connections forged in Equinix data centers through the power of interconnection are vital to accelerating our customers' businesses. To help companies understand, deploy and benefit from global interconnection, Equinix has created a blueprint for becoming an interconnected enterprise - the Interconnection Oriented Architecture® (IOA®) strategy. Based on work with many Fortune 500 customers, our IOA framework is an engagement model that both enterprises and solution providers can leverage to directly and securely connect people, locations, clouds and data. An IOA strategy shifts the fundamental IT delivery architecture from siloed and centralized to interconnected and distributed. Since the introduction of its IOA strategy, Equinix has created the "IOA Playbook" and "IOA Knowledge Base™," which were developed from our aggregated learnings across more than 600 Equinix customer (enterprise and service provider) deployments. These tools are offered online at no charge to any organization and provide fundamental, repeatable steps that organizations can take to deploy an IOA strategy across common digital workloads. They offer application blueprints for networks, security, data and applications, as well as for various use cases including ecosystems, analytics, content delivery, collaboration, hybrid multicloud and the IoT.
When combined with Equinix's critical mass of network and cloud providers and content companies, the increasing rate of adoption of an IOA strategy by the world's enterprise companies enables Equinix to extend its leadership as one of the core interconnection hubs of the information-driven, digital world. The density of providers inside Equinix is a key selling point for companies looking to connect with a diverse set of networks and deliver the best connectivity to their end customers at the digital edge, as well as to network companies that want to sell bandwidth to companies and efficiently interconnect with other networks. Equinix currently houses more than 1,800 unique networks, including the top-tier networks, which allow customers to directly interconnect with providers that best meet their unique price and performance needs. We have a growing mass of key players in cloud and IT services (Amazon Web Services, AT&T, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Office 365, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud and SAP Cloud Platform, Salesforce.com, IBM Cloud and VMware Cloud), and in the enterprise and financial/insurance sectors (Anheuser-Busch, Aon, Bloomberg, Deloitte, Ericsson, Ford Motors, NASDAQ, PayPal, Sysco Foods and The Society of Lloyd's) as customers. We expect these customer segments will continue to grow as customers seek to leverage our density of network providers and interconnect directly with each other to improve performance.
Streamline ease of doing business globally. Customers say data center reliability, power availability and network choice are the most important attributes they consider when choosing a data center provider in a particular location. We have long been recognized as a leader in these areas.
In 2018, more than half of our revenue came from customers with deployments in all three of our global regions, and we expect global solutions to become an increasingly important data center selection criteria as the need for globally interconnected, on-demand digital IT architectures continues to grow. We continue to focus on strategic acquisitions to expand our market coverage and on global product standardization, pricing and contracts harmonization initiatives to meet these global demands.

  Deepen existing ecosystems and develop new ones. As various enterprises and service and content providers locate in our IBX data centers, their suppliers and business partners benefit by doing the same, and they gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct, global interconnection for their business ecosystems. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "network effect" of customer adoption. Our interconnection offerings enable scalable, secure, reliable and cost-effective interconnectivity and optimized traffic exchange, which lowers overall costs and increases flexibility. The ability to directly and globally interconnect with a wide variety of companies is a key differentiator for us and enables companies to create new opportunities within unique ecosystems by working together. We also have efficient and innovative internet and cloud exchange platforms in our IBX sites to accelerate commercial growth within the ecosystems via the network effect.
Expand our product and service portfolio. Our customers’ needs for new solutions to help them scale and adopt new technologies inspire us to create new products and services. We recently introduced our Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric™ to connect our data centers around the world and enable customers to connect on demand to clouds, networks and any other customer from any Equinix location. We also recently introduced Equinix SmartKey™, a global key management and encryption as a service offering to help our customers manage the security requirements of disbursing data across multiple clouds and third-party providers. We will continue to work with our customers to innovate and introduce new solutions to meet their evolving needs.
 Expand vertical go-to-market plan. We plan to continue to focus our go-to-market efforts on customer segments and business applications that appreciate the Equinix value proposition of interconnection, reliability, global reach and prime collaboration opportunities within and across ecosystems. We have identified these segments today as cloud and IT services, content and digital media, financial services, enterprises, and network and mobile service providers. As digital business evolves, we will continue to identify and focus our go-to-market efforts on industry segments that need our value proposition.
Accelerate global reach and scale. We continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in select markets based on customer demand. In April 2018, we purchased the 1.6 million-square foot Infomart Building™ in Dallas, including its operations and tenants, where we had already been operating four data centers. Also, in April 2018, we completed our acquisition of Australian data center provider Metronode and its 10 data centers, which expanded our operations into Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth, and added scale in Melbourne and Sydney. This acquisition tripled our Australian data center footprint to 15 sites. Careful, steady expansion has been key to our growth strategy since our founding, as we seek to offer our customers interconnection opportunities ahead of demand. As of the end of 2018, Equinix's total global footprint had expanded to 200 data centers in 52 markets in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
We expect to continue to execute our global expansion strategy in a cost-effective and disciplined manner through a combination of acquiring existing data centers through lease or purchase, acquiring or investing in local data center operators, and building new IBX data centers based on key criteria, such as demand and potential financial return in each market.

In the peering community, we play an important industry leadership role by acting as the relationship broker between parties who would like to interconnect within our IBX data centers or between regionally distributed IBX data centers. Our staff holds or has held significant positions in many leading industry groups, such as the North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Members of our staff have published industry-recognized white papers and strategy documents in the areas of peering and interconnection, many of which are used by other institutions worldwide in furthering the education and promotion of this important set of solutions. 
Our current interconnection solutions are comprised of the following:
Physical Cross Connect/Direct Interconnections. Customers needing to directly and privately connect to another IBX data center customer can do so through single or multi-mode fiber. These cross connections are the physical link between customers and can be implemented within 24 hours of request. 
Equinix Internet Exchange™. Customers may choose to connect to and peer through the central switching fabric of our Equinix Internet Exchange, rather than purchase a direct physical cross connection. With a connection to this switch, a customer can aggregate multiple interconnects over one physical connection with multiple, linked 100-gigabit ports of capacity, instead of purchasing individual physical cross connects. 
Equinix Metro Connect. Customers who are located in one IBX data center may need to interconnect with networks or other customers located in an adjacent or nearby IBX data center in the same metro area. Metro Connect allows customers to seamlessly interconnect between IBX data centers at capacities up to 100 Gigabits per second. 
Internet Connectivity. Customers who are installing equipment in our IBX data centers generally require IP connectivity or bandwidth access. Although many large customers prefer to contract directly with carriers, we offer customers the ability to contract for IP connectivity and bandwidth access through us from any of the major bandwidth providers in that data center. This bandwidth access is targeted to customers who require a single bill and a single point of support through Equinix for the entire contract for their bandwidth needs. 
Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric™ (ECX Fabric™).

Cloud Consulting Services. Many companies are migrating to a hybrid or multicloud environment as the cloud's cost advantages and flexibility are critical in an era of rising electronic collaboration and user expectations. Equinix's Professional Services for Cloud are designed to facilitate cloud migration with a detailed assessment, design and implementation process that gives customers a faster, smoother path to the cloud. The 2,900 cloud and IT service providers and 1,800 network service providers within Equinix's network help our experts tailor cloud deployments to individual business needs and maximize their cloud performance, savings and security while ensuring future resilience and agility.
Network and IOA Transformation Services. While digital transformation creates new revenue streams, it also creates congestion and performance issues for an organization's legacy network. The growth in data, applications and locations that must be served by a digital enterprise, plus the reduction in latency required by real-time applications, all put stress on legacy IT infrastructure. Equinix's Professional Services for network and IOA transformation helps companies plan and build their future network and infrastructure architectures and get ready to tackle the challenges of digital business today and tomorrow.

Equinix Marketplace
Marketplace is a service for customers that helps them innovate and grow their business by connecting them to rich industry ecosystems and qualified buyers and sellers within our IBX data centers and in the surrounding markets.
Equinix Customer Portal
The Customer Portal offers 24/7 access to our customer care personnel, so customers can report problems, schedule shipments or order Smart Hands services at any time of the day or night. Equinix conducts a significant number of its transactions with its customers via this portal.
Business Continuity Trading Rooms
Trading infrastructure is mission-critical for financial firms worldwide, and our Business Continuity Trading Rooms (BCTRs) ensure that trading does not stop, even if primary operations are knocked off-line or are disabled. A BCTR backs up our customers' trading operations in one of our secure data center facilities, right down to telephone services and multiple desktop monitors. BCTR offerings are protected with backup generators and uninterruptible power supply to guarantee reliability and deliver peace of mind. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales. We use a direct sales force and channel marketing program to market our offerings to global enterprises, content providers, financial companies, and mobile and network service providers. We organize our sales force by customer type, as well as by establishing a sales presence in diverse geographic regions, which enables efficient servicing of the customer base from a network of regional offices. In addition to our worldwide headquarters located in Silicon Valley, we have established an Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Hong Kong and an EMEA regional headquarters in Amsterdam. We also operate a network of sales offices to deploy our field sales and support teams in our major markets across all three regions.
Our sales team works closely with each customer to foster the natural network effect of our IBX model, resulting in access to a wider potential customer base via our existing customers. As a result of the IBX interconnection model, IBX data center participants often encourage their customers, suppliers and business partners to also locate in our IBX data centers. These customers, suppliers and business partners, in turn, encourage their business partners to locate in our IBX data centers, resulting in additional customer growth. This network effect significantly reduces our new customer acquisition costs. In addition, large network providers, cloud providers or managed service providers may refer customers to Equinix as a part of their total customer solution. Equinix also focuses the selling by our vertical sales specialists on supporting specific industry requirements for network, mobile, and media and content providers, financial services, cloud computing, systems integrators and enterprise customer segments.
The Equinix channel program adds an ecosystem of system integrators and service providers, from managed network to cloud services. They help our customers design and deploy the right cloud and IT solutions needed to reach their customers, employees and supply chains. Our channel partners understand how to leverage and integrate the advantages of the Platform Equinix global footprint, high performance connectivity options and global supply-chain ecosystems to deliver solutions that meet our customers' performance, reliability and cost requirements.
Marketing. To support our sales efforts and to actively promote our brand in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include active public relations and ongoing customer communications programs. Our marketing efforts are focused on major business and trade publications, online media outlets, industry events and sponsored activities. Our staff holds leadership positions in key networking organizations, and we participate in a variety of internet, enterprise IT, computer and financial industry conferences, placing our officers and employees in keynote speaking engagements at these conferences. We also regularly measure customer satisfaction levels and host key customer forums to ensure customer needs are understood and incorporated in product and service planning efforts. From a brand perspective, we build recognition through our website, external blog and social media channels by sponsoring or leading industry technical forums, by participating in internet industry standard-setting bodies and through advertising, paid social media and online campaigns. We continue to develop and host industry educational forums focused on peering technologies and practices for ISPs and content providers.

Our Competition
While a large number of enterprises own their own data centers, many others outsource some or all of their requirements to multi-tenant data center (MTDC) facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. We believe that the outsourcing trend is likely to accelerate in the coming years. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 1,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world, ranging in size from firms with a single data center in a single market to firms in over 20 markets. Equinix competes with these firms which vary in terms of their data center offerings, including:
Colocation Providers
Colocation data centers are a type of MTDC that can also be referred to as "retail" data center space. Typically, colocation data center space is offered on the basis of individual racks/cabinets or cages ranging from 500 to 10,000 square feet in size. Typical customers of colocation providers include:

• | Large enterprises with significant IT expertise and requirements


• | Small and medium businesses looking to outsource data center requirements


• | Cloud and network service providers


• | Electronic trading, digital payments and financial services companies


• | Internet application providers


• | Major internet content, entertainment and social networking providers


• | Shared, dedicated and managed hosting providers


• | Mobile and network service providers


• | Content delivery networks

Full facility maintenance and systems, including fire suppression, security, power backup and HVAC, are routinely included in managed colocation offerings. A variety of additional services are typically available, including remote hands technician services and network monitoring services.
Providers in addition to Equinix that offer colocation both globally and locally include firms such as COLT and NTT.
Carrier-Neutral Colocation Providers
In addition to data center space and power, colocation providers also offer interconnection. Some of these providers, known as network or carrier-neutral colocation providers, can offer customers the choice of hundreds of network service providers or ISPs to choose from. Typically, customers use interconnection to buy ethernet or internet connectivity, perform financial exchange and settlement functions or perform business-to-business e-commerce. Carrier-neutral data centers are often located in key network hubs around the world, such as New York, Ashburn, Va., London, Amsterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong. Two types of data center facilities offering carrier-neutral colocation are used for many network-to-network interconnections:

• | A Meet Me Room (MMR) is typically a smaller space, generally 5,000 square feet or less, located in a major carrier hotel and often found in a wholesale data center facility.


• | A carrier-neutral data center is generally larger than an MMR and may be a stand-alone building separate from existing carrier hotels.

Providers in addition to Equinix that we believe could be defined as offering carrier-neutral colocation include CoreSite, Digital Realty Trust, Global Switch, Interxion and Telehouse.
Wholesale Data Center Providers
Wholesale data center providers lease data center space that is typically offered in cells or pods (i.e., individual white-space rooms) ranging in size from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet or larger. Wholesale data center offerings are targeted to both enterprises and colocation providers. These data centers primarily provide space and power without additional services like technicians, remote hands services or network monitoring (although other tenants might offer such services).
Sample wholesale data center providers include Digital Realty Trust and Global Switch.

Managed Hosting Providers
Managed hosting services are provided by several firms that also provide data center colocation solutions. Typically, managed hosting providers can manage server hardware that is owned by either the hosting provider or the customer. They can also provide a combination of comprehensive systems administration, database administration and sometimes application management services. Frequently, this results in managed hosting providers "running" the customer's servers, although such administration is frequently shared. The provider may manage such functions as operating systems, databases, security and patch management, while the customer will maintain management of the applications riding on top of those systems.
The full list of potential services that can be offered as part of managed hosting is substantial and includes services such as remote management, custom applications, helpdesk, messaging, databases, disaster recovery, managed storage, managed virtualization, managed security, managed networks and systems monitoring. Managed hosting services are typically used for:

• | Application hosting by organizations of any size, including large enterprises


• | Hosted or managed messaging, including Microsoft Exchange and other complex messaging applications


• | Complex or highly scalable web hosting or e-commerce websites


• | Managed storage solutions (including large drive arrays or backup robots)


• | Server disaster recovery and business continuity, including clustering and global server load balancing


• | Database servers, applications and services

Examples of managed hosting providers include: AT&T, CenturyLink, NaviSite, Rackspace, SunGard and Verizon Business.
Unlike other providers whose core businesses are bandwidth or managed services, we focus on neutral interconnection hubs for cloud and IT service providers, content providers, financial companies, enterprises and network service providers. As a result, we do not have the limited choices found commonly at other hosting/colocation companies. We compete based on the quality of our IBX data centers, our ability to provide a one-stop global solution in our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific locations, the performance and diversity of our network- and cloud-neutral strategy, and the economic benefits of the aggregation of top network, cloud and business ecosystems under one roof. We expect to continue to benefit from prevailing industry trends, including the need to create a “digital edge”, the growth of proximity communities, the increasing adoption of IOT, AI, 5G cloud computing, the continued growth of internet traffic and the increased power and cooling requirements of new generations of IT equipment.
