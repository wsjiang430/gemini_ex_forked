ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
 The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 3, 2007 under the name Descanso Agency, Inc. We originally incorporated to enter into the travel industry by establishing a specialized service travel company that serves the needs of Mexican and United States wedding planners, travel agents, and clients seeking upscale personal attention at unique hotels and spas located in Mexico. Our core business plan was intended to focus on the wedding and party destination travel. However, due to a lack of available financing, the Company ceased its current operations in September 2009 relating to the travel industry and began seeking out viable alternatives.
 
On October 16, 2009, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to Pacific Blue Energy Corp. The name change reflected the Company's refocused business at that time as an independent alternative energy company. We began the process of approaching potential investment partners and have also began seeking out potential opportunities, including joint venture opportunities. We attempted to finance our operations through a combination of privately placed debt and/or equity. With the alignment st thst time of a number of positive factors including technical advances, tax incentives, rising environmental awareness and the state of the economy, the availability of clean, affordable, solar and wind powered electricity to power homes and small businesses thrn become a reality.
 
Effective November 6, 2009, the Company implemented a 4-for-1 forward split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, whereby every share of common stock held was exchanged for 4 shares of common stock. As a result, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock were increased from 9,250,000 prior to the forward split to 37,000,000 immediately following the forward split.
 
On April 5, 2010, the Company acquired a 100% interest of Ship Ahoy LLC, a limited liability company in Arizona, in exchange for $300,000 and 1,000,000 common shares of the Company. This investment was subsequently abandoned by the Company and the Company is currently a non-operating shell company.
