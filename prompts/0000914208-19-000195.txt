Item 1.  Business
Introduction 
Invesco Ltd. (Invesco or the company) is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering an investment experience that helps people get more out of life. Our comprehensive range of active, passive and alternative investment capabilities has been constructed over many years to help clients achieve their investment objectives. We draw on this comprehensive range of capabilities to provide customized solutions designed to deliver key outcomes aligned to client needs (our most important benchmark). 
 With more than 7,000 employees and an on-the-ground presence in 25 countries, Invesco is well positioned to meet the needs of investors across the globe. We have specialized investment teams managing investments across a broad range of asset classes, investment styles and geographies. We provide a comprehensive range of investment capabilities and outcomes, delivered through a diverse set of investment vehicles, to help clients achieve their investment objectives. For decades, individuals and institutions have viewed our organization as a trusted partner for a broad range of investment needs. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia-Pacific, serving clients in more than 120 countries. As of December 31, 2018, the firm managed $888.2 billion in assets for investors around the world.
The key drivers of success for Invesco are long-term investment performance, competitive pricing, high-quality client service and effective distribution relationships, delivered across a diverse spectrum of investment management capabilities, distribution channels, geographic areas and market exposures. By achieving success in these areas, we seek to deliver better outcomes for clients and generate competitive investment results, positive net flows, increased assets under management (AUM) and associated revenues. We are affected significantly by market movements, which are beyond our control; however, we endeavor to mitigate the impact of market movements by maintaining broad diversification across asset classes, investment vehicles, client domiciles and geographies. We measure relative investment performance by comparing our investment capabilities to competitors' products, industry benchmarks and client investment objectives. Generally, distributors, investment advisors and consultants take into consideration longer-term investment performance (e.g., three-year and five-year performance) in their selection of investment products and manager recommendations to their clients, although shorter-term performance may also be an important consideration. Third-party ratings may also influence client investment decisions. We monitor quality of client service in a variety of ways, including periodic client satisfaction surveys, analysis of response times and redemption rates, competitive benchmarking of services and feedback from investment consultants.
Invesco Ltd. is organized under the laws of Bermuda, and our common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IVZ.” We maintain a website at www.invesco.com. (Information contained on our website shall not be deemed to be part of, or be incorporated into, this document).
Strategy 
The company focuses on four key long-term strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs, further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our long-term success:

• | Achieve strong, long-term investment performance across distinct investment capabilities with clearly articulated investment philosophies and processes, aligned with client needs;


• | Be instrumental to our clients' success by delivering our distinctive investment capabilities worldwide to meet their needs;

4





• | Harness the power of our global platform by continuously improving execution effectiveness to enhance quality and productivity, and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business; and


• | Perpetuate a high-performance organization by driving greater transparency, accountability, diversity of thought, fact-based decision making and execution at all levels.

As an integrated global investment manager, we are keenly focused on meeting clients' needs and operating effectively and efficiently as an integrated, global organization. We take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management.”
We believe one of Invesco's great strengths is our separate, distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe. A key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain well-performing investment capabilities. We believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm.
2018 Developments
Throughout 2018, we made solid progress in several areas that will help us better meet client needs, further strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term. At the same time, 2018 was a challenging year for the asset management industry and for Invesco. We saw volatile markets throughout the year and particularly during the fourth quarter. These market headwinds, combined with underperformance in certain investment capabilities and challenges in the global markets in which we operate - such as the uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the trade war between the U.S. and China - led to negative net flows for the firm in 2018 after nine consecutive years of positive net flows. 
During 2018, we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term. We continued to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by making or agreeing to make certain acquisitions, hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platform, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary. We believe the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm, and we will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients. Some highlights of 2018 are as follows:

▪ | The most significant announcement during the year was our planned acquisition of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company's ("MassMutual") asset management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will help accelerate Invesco’s growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment capabilities. We will also be better positioned to deliver strong outcomes for clients, since overall performance rankings for U.S. mutual funds are consistently stronger for the combined firm than for either firm independently. Invesco entered into a definitive agreement to acquire OppenheimerFunds from MassMutual, which included $226.9 billion(1) of AUM at January 31, 2019. This strategic transaction will bring Invesco’s total AUM to more than $1.1 trillion, making it the 13th-largest global investment manager and sixth-largest U.S. retail investment manager(2), further enhancing the company’s ability to meet client needs through its comprehensive range of high-conviction active, passive and alternative capabilities; 


▪ | Completed the acquisition of Guggenheim Investments’ exchange-traded funds (ETF) business. The acquisition strengthened Invesco’s market-leading ETF capabilities as well as the firm’s efforts to meet the needs of institutional and retail clients in the U.S. and across the globe, which will contribute further to the growth and long-term success of the business;


▪ | Completed the acquisition of Intelliflo, the No. 1 technology platform(3) for financial advisors in the UK. The addition of Intelliflo builds on the 2016 acquisition of Jemstep to enable an advisor-focused digital platform that enhances the firm’s ability to meet evolving client needs;


• | Further strengthened our market-leading solutions capability, leveraging one of the industry’s strongest, most experienced solutions teams to enable customized outcomes for clients;


• | Continued to enhance our culture and provide development opportunities for our talented professionals across the globe;


• | Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company ("Invesco Great Wall"), the company's largest joint venture in China, is experiencing strong growth. In June, Invesco Great Wall's Jingyi Money Market Fund was selected as one of seven money market funds to be included in the money market program, Yu'E Bao, administered by Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba;


▪ | Invesco has launched a fixed income fund for investors to buy into investment opportunities driven by China's 'Belt and Road' (B&R) initiative;

5





▪ | Invesco Great Wall won numerous industry awards during the Asset Management Association of China's inaugural event to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of China's fund industry;


• | Invesco won the 2018 Multi Asset Manager of the year award, which was given at the LAPF Investment Awards held in London;


• | Invesco earned an A+ rating in PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) for its overall approach to responsible investment for second consecutive year;


• | Invesco was named the best-performing ETF in the U.S. Small Cap Healthcare and Software categories;


• | In 2018, Invesco was named one of the best places to work in money management by Pensions and Investments.


Taken together, this work further expanded the broad range of capabilities Invesco uses to create solutions that deliver the outcomes clients are seeking, all wrapped in a robust, value-added client experience. These initiatives also further strengthen the firm’s effectiveness and efficiency, providing greater economies of scale that will enable us to provide a higher level of value to clients and further improve our competitive position.

Industry Trends 
 Trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes:

• | Clients are demanding more from investment managers. While investment performance remains paramount, competitive pricing, client engagement and value-added services (including portfolio analytics and providing consultative solutions) increasingly differentiate managers. Invesco is working to enhance the client's user experience through digital marketing (web, mobile, social) and improved service. The building out of Invesco Solutions to respond to this trend is among the firm's top priorities.


• | Investors are continuing to shift to alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies. As a consequence, Invesco and the industry are seeing client demand for core equities and fixed income portfolios decline as a share of global flows. Invesco is the #2 provider of smart beta AUM globally and has 60 ETFs with greater than $500 million in assets.(1) Invesco also has a strong lineup of alternative and multi-asset strategies supported by ongoing product development. 


• | We are seeing increased pressure on pricing within the asset management industry, arising from further concentration within our channel distribution partners (which increases their ability to negotiate pricing) and additional regulatory scrutiny on industry fees.


• | Distribution partners are becoming more selective and are moving towards developing fewer relationships and partners, reducing the number of investment managers with whom they work.


• | Regulatory activity remains at increased levels and is influencing competitive dynamics. Increased regulatory scrutiny of managers has focused on many areas including transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation. Invesco continues to proactively work with regulators around the world. Efforts to further modernize and strengthen our global platform will enhance our ability to compete effectively across markets while complying with the variety of applicable regulatory regimes. 


• | Although the developed markets in the U.S. and Europe are currently the two largest markets for financial assets by a wide margin, other key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, are positioned for future growth over the long term despite near-term headwinds. As these population-heavy markets mature, we believe investment managers that are truly global will be in the best position to capture this growth. Additionally, population age differences between emerging and developed markets will result in differing investment needs and horizons among countries. Asset allocation and retirement savings schemes also differ substantially among countries. We believe firms such as Invesco, with diversified investment capabilities and product types, are best positioned to meet clients' needs in this global competitive landscape. Invesco has a meaningful market presence in many of the world's most attractive regions, including North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We believe our strong and growing presence in established and emerging markets provides significant long-term growth potential for our business.

• | Technology advances are impacting core elements of the investment management industry which lags other industries in its use of technology. Clients increasingly seek to interact digitally with their investment portfolios. This is leading to established managers investing in and/or acquiring "robo" platforms. As the investment management business becomes more complex, automation will become increasingly important to serve clients effectively and efficiently. Invesco is leveraging technology across its business and exploring opportunities to work with third-party technology firms to enhance our clients' investment experience. This includes the addition of Jemstep, our advisor-powered digital advice capability, to offer digital advice as a means for strengthening existing client relationships by offering a comprehensive wealth management service. The addition of Intelliflo to our existing Jemstep capability strengthens our ability to enable an advisor-focused digital platform and positions us ahead of evolving client needs. 

As a result of the trends discussed above, clients are seeking to work with a smaller number of asset managers who can meet a comprehensive set of needs. They want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives. They also want greater value for their money, which means competitive pricing, investor education, thought leadership, digital platforms and other value added services that create an enhanced client experience. These dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry and that we believe will drive increasing consolidation. We believe the steps we have taken over the past decade and throughout 2018 strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure Invesco is well-positioned to compete and win within our industry.

Other External Factors Impacting Invesco 
Invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of our peers. As one of the leading investment managers in the UK and Europe, we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Additionally, our strong position in Asia Pacific meant that Invesco was more affected than others by market uncertainties over the trade issues between China and the U.S. 
In 2016, the UK electorate voted to leave the European Union. Withdrawal is schedule to occur on March 29, 2019. At this time, the terms of the withdrawal and the UK's future relationship with the EU are not agreed.  If the withdrawal treaty is agreed in time, Invesco would be able to operate on a business-as-usual basis during a transitional period while the full details of the UK's future relationship with the EU become defined; however, if the UK leaves the EU on Mach 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place, there would be considerable uncertainty, including uncertainty about continuing trade between the UK and the EU. On January 30, 2019, EU27 national regulators reached agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority to ensure the continued practice of “delegation” in the event of a Brexit without a withdrawal agreement in place. Delegation allows funds to continue to be managed in the UK while being domiciled in another EU country. This agreement will prevent disruption for fund groups and help in Brexit contingency planning, which will help maintain market stability in the EU and ensure investor protection. There may be some disruption for non-fund accounts.
The UK economy has been in a period of uncertainty with volatility expected in financial markets until the terms of withdrawal are agreed upon. We believe uncertainty in the markets was a factor in the decline in AUM within our UK operations, where AUM from clients domiciled in the UK were $85.1 billion at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: $110.9 billion). At December 31, 2018 approximately 6% of our AUM are UK entities providing investment services to EU-based fund management subsidiaries and EU-based clients. Most of this activity is anticipated to be able to continue even if a formal UK exit agreement is not reached. 
Invesco is a global business, and has been committed for many years to meeting clients’ needs across Europe in both EU and non-EU countries. Invesco has local teams of experts focused on servicing local clients and fund ranges in different countries to meet a variety of local, country and regional client needs.  We currently have a presence in 11 member states across the EU (excluding the UK), employing over 370 staff; our staff will be able to continue to reside and work across the relevant regions.  The change in the UK's status from an EU to a non-EU country will not change Invesco’s focus or commitment to serve its clients across Europe. We have plans in place which will enable us to respond to a variety of different potential scenarios and we believe we are fully prepared to continue to operate and deliver for our clients with minimal disruption. 
Investment Management Capabilities 
We believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their well-defined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage. There are few independent

investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. Our asset classes, broadly defined, include money market, balanced, equity, fixed income and alternatives. 
The following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class:

Distribution Channels
Retail AUM originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units. Institutional AUM originates from entities such as individual corporate clients, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities or charities. AUM disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated AUM distributed by type of sales team (the company's internal distribution channels). AUM amounts disclosed as retail channel AUM represents AUM distributed by the company's retail sales team; whereas AUM amounts disclosed as institutional channel AUM represents AUM distributed by the company's institutional sales team.
The company operates as an integrated global investment manager, presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world. This is supported with the cross-selling of investment capabilities globally and integrated internal sales forces. As a result, the company's retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types. Therefore, not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are "retail" products, and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are "institutional" products. This aggregation, however, is viewed as a proxy for presenting AUM in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate.

The following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel:

Retail | Institutional 
● Closed-end Mutual Funds | ● Collective Trust Funds 
● Exchange-traded Funds (ETF) | ● Exchange-traded Funds (ETF) 
● Individual Savings Accounts (ISA) | ● Institutional Separate Accounts
● Investment Companies with Variable Capital (ICVC) | ● Open-end Mutual Funds

● Open-end Mutual Funds | 
● Separately Managed Accounts (SMA) | 
● Société d'investissement à Capital Variable (SICAV) | 
● Unit Investment Trusts (UIT) | 
● Variable Insurance Funds | 

Retail
Retail AUM were $566.7 billion at December 31, 2018. We offer retail products within all of the major asset classes. Our retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, fund supermarkets, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in North America, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and supermarket platforms in Europe and Asia. 
The U.K., North American and Continental European retail operations rank among the largest by AUM in their respective markets. As of December 31, 2018, Invesco holds a leading position amongst retail fund providers in the U.K.; Invesco's U.S. retail business, including our ETF franchise, is the 10th largest fund complex in the U.S. by long-term assets and Invesco in Continental Europe was among the largest non-proprietary investment managers in the retail channel. Invesco Great Wall was one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with total AUM of approximately $26.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. We provide our retail clients with one of the industry's most robust and comprehensive product lines.
Institutional
Institutional AUM were $321.5 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018. We offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies, including traditional and quantitative equities, fixed income (including money market funds for institutional clients), real estate, private equity, financial structures and absolute return strategies. Regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world. We have a diversified client base that includes major public entities, corporations, unions, non-profit organizations, endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Invesco's institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions, government entities and corporations in the world.
AUM Diversification
One of Invesco's greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class. Our distribution network has attracted assets of 64% retail and 36% institutional as of December 31, 2018. By client domicile, 36% of client AUM are outside the U.S., and we serve clients in more than 120 countries. The following tables present a breakdown of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, the fourth table below illustrates the split of our AUM as Passive and Active. Passive AUM include index-based ETFs, unit investment trusts (UITs), non-management fee earning AUM, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.

Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, the company had 7,459 employees across the globe. Increases in 2018 relate primarily to the acquisition of Intelliflo, inclusion of 100% of Invesco Great Wall and growth in Jemstep. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had 7,030 and 6,790 employees, respectively. None of our employees is covered under collective bargaining agreements. 
Competition 
The investment management business is highly competitive, with points of differentiation including investment performance, the level of fees, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, the depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service. We compete with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions. We believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities, product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business. We also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage, as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute and/or service those products. Lastly, we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our long-term competitive position.
Management Contracts
We derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients. Fees vary with the type of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and lower fees earned on fixed income, money market and stable value accounts, as well as certain ETFs. Investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days' notice. Typically, retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods.
Risk Management
Invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach. We believe a key factor in Invesco's ability to manage through all market cycles is our integrated approach to risk management. Invesco’s enterprise risk management approach is embedded its management decision-making processes across the organization and provides a consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business and operational risks with coordination between the two.  

• | Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group, which provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks.


• | Business and operational risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee which facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks both existing and emerging, as well as appropriate ongoing management and Board oversight.

Further, a network of functional, geographic and specific risk management committees under the guidance and standards of the Corporate Risk Management Committee maintain ongoing risk assessment, management and monitoring processes that provide a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business.
