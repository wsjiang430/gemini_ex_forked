ITEM 1    BUSINESS
Overview Glatfelter is a leading global supplier of engineered materials. Our high-quality, innovative, and customizable solutions are found in tea and single-serve coffee filtration, personal hygiene, as well as in many diverse packaging, home improvement and industrial applications. Our 2022 net sales were $1.5 billion with customers in over 100 countries. Our operations utilize a variety of manufacturing technologies including airlaid, wetlaid, and spunlace with sixteen manufacturing sites located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the Philippines. We have sales offices in all major geographies serving customers under the Glatfelter and Sontara brands.
In 2022, Glatfelter had a transition in leadership by appointing Thomas Fahnemann as the new Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In making the transition, the Board of Directors reaffirmed its view that Glatfelter has the right combination of business segments serving attractive, growth-oriented markets and customers with sustainable product offerings, but has brought in a new CEO to address the challenges impacting Glatfelter’s financial performance while charting a new direction to unlock the full value of Glatfelter. As such, we initiated a turnaround strategy in late 2022 that focuses on six key initiatives to drive profitability improvements:
•Portfolio optimization - Includes reviewing our entire asset portfolio and considering the strategic, financial, and operational value of each asset in the near- and long-term. We will focus on areas of our portfolio that have scale, or the potential for scale, a strong market leading position and core competencies in manufacturing technology. 
•Margin improvement - This is a fundamental part of the turnaround strategy which includes placing greater focus on profitability rather than simple top-line growth. We will continue to address input costs and will continue to see the benefit of pricing actions throughout the course of 2023. 
•Fixed asset reduction - Includes evaluating our fixed costs and taking action to make significant reductions. We anticipate that the savings underway will generate full year run-rate savings in the range of $9 – $10 million by 2024. 
•Cash liberation - This initiative is supported by the work on the first three initiatives in our plan. We will focus on paying down debt, decreasing our leverage, and increasing EBITDA. We will continue to make prudent decisions with respect to capital allocation and maintain a disciplined approach to managing our accounts receivables, finished goods inventory and raw material pricing. The Board’s decision last year to suspend the dividend frees up approximately $25 million of cash annually. 
•Operational effectiveness - We are driving continuous improvements across our operations, identifying areas for process enhancements and waste reduction, and expanding operational best practices across the organization. 
•Return Spunlace to profitability - We are executing all the initiatives in our turnaround plan with a heightened sense of urgency of returning our Spunlace segment to profitability.
We manage our business and make investment decisions under a functional operating model with three distinct reporting segments: Airlaid Materials, Composite Fibers and Spunlace. These segments serve growing global customers and markets providing innovative and customizable solutions, ultimately delivering high-quality engineered materials. As a leading global supplier of engineered materials for consumer and industrial applications, we partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide innovative solutions delivering outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have divested non-strategic assets and made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the market demands 

GLATFELTER 2022 FORM 10-K

and grow our sales. We are committed to growing with our key markets and will make appropriate investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands.
In 2021, we completed two significant acquisitions to further our business transformation and in alignment with our stated strategy. On May 13, 2021, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding equity interests of Georgia-Pacific Mt. Holly LLC, Georgia-Pacific’s U.S. nonwovens business (“Mount Holly”), for $170.9 million. This business includes the Mount Holly, NC manufacturing facility and an R&D center and pilot line for nonwovens product development in Memphis, TN. The Mount Holly facility produces high-quality airlaid products for the wipes, hygiene, and other nonwoven materials markets, competing in the marketplace with nonwoven technologies and substrates, as well as other materials focused primarily on consumer based end-use applications. The Mount Holly acquisition expanded our footprint and income generation in the U.S. and balanced our sales mix between the Airlaid Materials and Composite Fibers segments. 
On October 29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of PMM Holding (Luxembourg) AG, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Jacob Holm”), a global leading manufacturer of premium quality spunlace nonwoven fabrics for critical cleaning, high-performance materials, personal care, hygiene and medical applications, for an enterprise value of approximately $304.0 million, including the extinguishment of debt. We expect the combination to create an expanded portfolio of engineered specialty applications manufactured on spunlace-based production assets with opportunities for long-term growth aligned with post-COVID lifestyle changes. Jacob Holm's results are reported prospectively from the date of acquisition as Spunlace, a newly established reporting segment.
Additional information related to these acquisitions is set forth in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 – “Acquisitions.”

Securing adequate quantities of abaca pulp and its source material, abaca fiber, are important to support growth in this segment. Abaca pulp, a specialized pulp with limited sources of availability globally, is produced by our Philippine pulp mill, providing a unique advantage to our Composite Fibers segment. As the supply of abaca fiber becomes constrained or when production demands exceed the capacity of the Philippines mill, alternative sources and/or substitute fibers are used to meet customer demands.
In addition to critical raw materials, Composite Fibers’ production cost is influenced by the price of electricity and natural gas. In 2022, Composite Fibers purchased approximately 74% of its electricity needs, the cost of which is influenced by the natural gas markets. In addition, the segment generates all the steam used in production by burning natural gas.
In Composite Fibers’ markets, competition is product line specific as the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing equipment limits the number of companies offering multiple product lines.
