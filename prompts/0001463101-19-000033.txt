Industry Background
Historically, traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar PV installations. In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter, the solar PV modules are connected in series strings. In a large installation, there are multiple series strings connected in parallel. The aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter. As compared to microinverter systems, we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems, including the following:

• | Productivity limits. If solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—group or “string” of modules are wired in series—an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowest-performing module. Because of its string design, there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional central inverter approach.

• | Reliability issues. Traditional central inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail, resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output. As a result, central inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years.


• | Complex design and installation requirements. The central inverter-based solar PV installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer, both in terms of design and on-site labor. Central inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation, as well as specialized equipment such as DC combiners, conduits and disconnects. In addition, the use of high-voltage direct current (“DC”) requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology.


• | Lack of monitoring. The majority of solar installations with central inverter technology offer limited monitoring capabilities. A failure of the central inverter will often go unnoticed for days or even weeks. If a module fails or is not performing to specification, the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time.


• | Safety issues. Central inverter solar PV installations have a wide distribution of high-voltage (600 volts to 1,000 volts) DC wiring. If damaged, DC wires can generate sustained electrical arcs, reaching temperatures of more than 5,000 °F. This creates the risk of fire for solar PV installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel.

These challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners:

• | Installer. Solar PV installers aim for simple installation design, fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability. The installation of high-voltage DC central inverter technology, however, requires significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string calculations, extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer.


• | System owner. Solar system owners aim for high energy production, low cost, high reliability, and low maintenance requirements, as well as reduced fire risks. With traditional central inverters, owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar PV installations due to string design limitations. As such, they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions, can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar PV installation. In addition, central inverter installations operate at high-voltage DC which bears significant fire risks. Further, due to their large size, central inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building.

Our Products
We design, develop, manufacture and sell home energy solutions that connect energy generation, energy storage and control and communications management on one intelligent platform. We have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and, combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies, provides advanced energy monitoring and control. This is vastly different than the string inverter approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array. The IQ platform, which is our current generation integrated solar, storage and energy management offering, enables self-consumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy, simplifying design and installation, and improving system uptime and reliability. The IQ family of microinverters, like all of our previous microinverters, is fully compliant with NEC 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements. Unlike string inverters, this capability is built-in, with no additional equipment necessary.

The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ™ brings a high technology, networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage, by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics, semiconductors and cloud-based software technologies. Our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ uses a single technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution, enabling rapid commissioning of the Installer Toolkit™; consumption monitoring with a metered Envoy™ and a consumption tracker; and energy insights from the Enphase Enlighten Software™, or Enlighten, platform’s easy-to-use interface. Unlike our core competitors, who utilize a single-point or traditional inverter, or offer separate components of solutions, we have built-in system redundancy in both PV generation and energy storage, eliminating the risk that comes with a single-point of failure. Further, the nature of our cloud-based, monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates, enabling cost-effective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance.
The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ consists of four key components — Enphase microinverters, the AC Battery™, an Envoy gateway, and Enlighten cloud-based software:

• | Enphase microinverters provide highly reliable power conversion at the individual solar module level by introducing a digital architecture that incorporates custom application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, specialized power electronics devices, and an embedded software subsystem that maximizes energy production from each module. The Enphase IQ microinverters provide a path to substantially lower unit cost, a simplified installation process, and higher performance and enhanced features. In addition, they offer advanced grid functions that are capable of meeting worldwide regulatory requirements.

In the first quarter of 2018, we began shipping IQ 7, our seventh-generation Enphase microinverters for the Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ, our next-generation integrated solar, storage and energy management system, to distributors in the U.S. In the second quarter of 2018, we began shipping IQ 7 to Europe, representing our entry into the German and Austrian solar markets, while expanding our presence in other solar markets such as France, Benelux, United Kingdom, and Switzerland. We also began selling IQ 7, which has a single worldwide stock keeping unit (commonly referred to as “SKU”), in Australia and New Zealand during the second quarter of 2018.
The Enphase IQ 7 Micro™ and Enphase IQ 7+ Micro™ support high-powered 60-cell and 72-cell solar modules and integrate with alternating current (“AC”) modules. During the second quarter of 2018, we began shipping the Enphase IQ 7X Micro™ to solar distributors in the U.S. The Enphase IQ 7X Micro, the higher power and higher efficiency variant of our seventh-generation family of microinverters, supports and can be integrated with 96-cell modules. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we began shipping in limited quantities, IQ 7A™, which addresses up to 450W DC modules. In addition, as the result of the completion of our acquisition of SunPower’s microinverter business in August 2018, we began volume shipments of our IQ 7XS microinverters for use in SunPower’s modules in the fourth quarter of 2018.
AC Module products are integrated systems which allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics, reduced installation times, faster inspection and training. We began shipping Enphase Energized™ AC Modules in North America in 2017. Enphase Energized AC Modules with IQ were previously produced through our AC module partnerships with LG Electronics, Inc., Jinko Solar Technology and Waaree Energies Ltd. In 2018, we announced new AC module partnerships with SunPower, Panasonic Corporation of North America, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. and Solaria Corporation.
Our next-generation microinverter system, IQ 8™, is based upon our grid-agnostic “always on” Ensemble™ technology, which will allow a solar system to operate independently of the power grid is expected to be introduced in the fourth quarter of 2019. This system has four components: (i) energy generation, which is accomplished with the grid-agnostic microinverter IQ 8; (ii) energy storage, which is achieved by the Encharge™ battery with capacities of 3.3 kWh, 10 kWh and 13.2 kWh; (iii) communication and control called Enpower™, which consists of the Automatic Transfer Switch that provides fine-grained load control and the combiner box with the Envoy gateway; and (iv) Enlighten, which is the internet of things, or IoT, cloud software.

The pure off-grid solution that Ensemble technology also addresses shipped in limited quantities to our partner on IQ 8 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect to ramp production in the first half of 2019.

• | The Enphase AC Battery™, a key part of the Enphase Home Energy Solution, applies the modular architecture developed for our microinverter to energy storage. Solar-plus-storage, which includes our AC Battery product, is central to our product strategy. Our approach delivers low up-front costs resulting from the AC Battery’s system design and the ease and speed of installation. The AC battery balances safety and performance and is warranted for 10 years.


• | The Envoy™ Communications Gateway with IQ Combiner+ is installed at the system location and serves as a hub providing three critical roles: collecting and sending data to Enlighten software, receiving and distributing microinverter firmware or software updates, and managing the use of energy within the system. Homeowners can maximize the value of their solar PV system, taking advantage of self-consumption and time-of-use tariff management opportunities with an expandable platform for evolving uses of energy storage, such as residential peak shaving and grid services. One Envoy is typically sold with each solar installation and can support up to 600 Enphase microinverters, making it compatible for both residential and commercial applications.


• | Our Enlighten cloud-based software provides the capabilities to remotely monitor, manage, and maintain an individual system or a fleet of systems. System owners can use Enphase Enlighten to monitor their home’s solar generation, energy storage and consumption from any web-enabled device. The software collects and analyzes system performance information to enable owners and operators to realize the highest performance of their solar PV system. Two versions of the monitoring software are available: MyEnlighten™, designed for consumers, which provides performance assurance and Enlighten Manager™, available for the solar professional, which provides detailed diagnostic capabilities, as well as fleet management tools.

Key benefits of our Home Energy Solution with IQ include: 

• | Truly Integrated. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ is a fully integrated solar generation plus storage offering from one provider. Designed and manufactured to work together, the Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ is a truly integrated home energy solution.


• | Higher Performance. Our microinverter system delivers higher performance by maximizing the energy production of each module. A microinverter at each module overcomes issues such as module-mismatch and soiling or shading which can have a significant impact on string inverter systems. Our microinverters also provide greater system availability with no single-point of failure. An independent analysis from PV Evolution Labs has concluded that an Enphase microinverter system yields higher performance over systems with string inverters or traditional inverters. We believe that our microinverter systems achieve higher energy production and can generate superior returns on investment relative to competitive solutions for system owners.


• | Simplified Design and Installation. Our all-AC infrastructure simplifies the design process and eliminates the typical costs of a complicated DC voltage system for PV or storage. In addition, our microinverters are installed on the roof and hidden from view, with minimal impact to the aesthetics of a home or building. We also offer additional tools, such as the Enphase Installer Toolkit mobile app or the Enphase IQ Combiner+™ with Enphase IQ Envoy™, which offer unmatched simplicity, reliability and ease of installation for solar installers.


• | Enhanced Safety. Microinverters and AC Batteries are safer because they process low voltage DC and are isolated to the module level, leading to an all-AC architecture. Our microinverter system does not contain any of the high voltages common to string inverter systems. High voltage arc faults associated with string or traditional inverters are the leading cause of fires in solar PV installations. Microinverter technology mitigates this safety risk.

– 7 –


• | Reduced Operations and Maintenance Costs. Our microinverter system is highly reliable with one million power-on hours of testing incorporated into our microinverter design. This high reliability, plus a distributed architecture means ongoing operations and maintenance do not require emergency truck rolls, unlike string inverter or traditional inverters which have a 100% probability of failure leading to full replacement within 10 to 12 years. In addition, with module-level monitoring capabilities, remote maintenance can pinpoint issues, thus reducing any time on site. Finally, the networked-nature of our system enables us to remotely update the firmware and software of the microinverters, reducing ongoing utility compliance costs.

Our partnership with Flex provides us with strategic manufacturing capabilities and flexibility. We announced in 2018 that starting in the second quarter of 2019, Flex is expected to begin producing our products in Mexico to serve the markets in the Americas. We anticipate that this additional manufacturing capacity in Mexico could help us to not only mitigate tariffs, but also better serve our customers by cutting down delivery times.
Customer Service
We continue to cultivate an organizational focus on customer satisfaction and are committed to providing a best-in-class customer experience. We maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group and the Enlighten cloud-based software portal. During 2018, we introduced self-service support tools to help installers and homeowners solve their problems quickly. We launched Service-on-the-Go™, which installers can use from their mobile devices to get service instantly. We also started tracking our Net Promoter Score (commonly referred to as “NPS”) as another tool to measure how our customers perceive us and how likely they are to recommend us to a friend or colleague.
Research and Development
We devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems, adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and optimize the effectiveness of our energy management solutions for our customers. We measure the effectiveness of our research and development against metrics, including product unit cost, efficiency, reliability, power output and ease-of-use.
Intellectual Property
We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property, or IP, rights are critical for success. We protect our technology through a variety of means, including through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2018, we had 220 issued U.S. patents, 118 issued foreign patents, 71 pending U.S. patent applications and 70 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2020 and 2037.
We license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our ASICs under a fully-paid, royalty-free license, which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain ASIC hardware should the licensor fail, under certain conditions, to deliver such technology in the future. This license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third-party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market. The license carries a 75-year term, subject to earlier termination upon agreement of the parties, or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor. 
We also license digital intellectual property cores, or IP blocks, for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products, including our ASICs, complex programmable logic devices, or CPLDs, and field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs. This is a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license providing for the integration of such digital IP blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products. Other than in connection with the distribution of our products, our use of such digital IP blocks is limited to certain of our business sites. The license is perpetual, subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination, suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business, or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us. In addition, we license open source software from third parties for integration into our Envoy products. Such open source software is licensed under open source licenses. These licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer, which we provide via our website.
We continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to DC to AC power conversion for alternative energy power systems, as well as power system monitoring, control and management systems.
– 9 –

With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures.
All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
As part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property, we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology.
Seasonality
Historically, the majority of our revenues are from the North American and European regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends, including weather patterns and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry, due to these same factors. Although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. 
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive, and we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers and new technology start-ups. The principal areas in which we compete with other companies include:

• | Product performance and features;


• | Total cost of ownership;


• | Breadth of product line;
