This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I—“Risk Factors.”
 
Odyssey Group International, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation in March 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 2372 Morse Ave., Irvine, CA 92614. The registration statement effectuating our initial public offering became effective in July 2015.
 
Currently our shares of common stock are listed on the Over the Counter (OTC) exchange and there is currently very little public market for our common stock. We are in the process of applying for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, known as the OTCQB.
 
As used herein, when we refer to “Odyssey”, “ODYY,” the “company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean Odyssey Group International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
JOBS Act
 
Recently the United States Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), which provides for certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to public companies that are reporting companies and are “emerging growth companies.” We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 3(a) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012), and we will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC) or more; (b) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (c) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b–2. Therefore, we expect to continue to be an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future.
 
Generally, a registrant that registers any class of its securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is required to include in the second and all subsequent annual reports filed by it under the Exchange Act a management report on internal control over financial reporting and, subject to an exemption available to registrants that meet the definition of a “smaller reporting company” in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, an auditor attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from the requirement to include an auditor attestation report in our annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, even if we do not qualify as a “smaller reporting company”. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are able to avail ourselves to the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and not to present to our stockholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, obtain approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved or present the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and our financial performance. We have irrevocably elected to comply with new or revised accounting standards even though we are an emerging growth company.
 
General
 
Odyssey Group International, Inc. (“Odyssey” or “the Company”), was formed as a publicly held holding company with an emphasis on the development and acquisition of medical products and health related technologies. The Company is focused on building and acquiring assets in areas that have an identified technological advantage and a substantial market opportunity within significant target markets across the globe.
 
The corporate mission is to create or acquire distinct assets, intellectual property, and technologies with an emphasis on acquisition targets that will generate positive cash flow. Our strategic mission is to deliver financial results, which yield high rates of returns for our shareholders and partners. The Company’s leadership team has significant experience and capabilities to further refine the technologies and submit to the appropriate regulatory agencies for marketing approval. We engaged The Center for Valuation Studies (“CFVS”) to assist in estimating the fair market value of the assets of the Company for general corporate purposes. To derive an estimate of fair market value of the assets, CFVS relied on the information provided by management.

Our business model is to develop or acquire medical related products, engage third parties to manufacture such products and then distribute the products through various distribution channels, including third parties. The Company has significant assets in three different life saving technologies; the CardioMap® heart monitoring and screening device, the Save A Life choking rescue device and a unique neurosteroid drug compound intended to treat rare brain disorders.
 
We intend to acquire other technologies and assets and plan to be a trans-disciplinary product development company involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of products and technologies that may be applied over various medical markets.
 
We intend to license, improve and/or develop our products and identify and select distribution channels. We intend to establish agreements with distributors to get products to market quickly as well as to undertake and engage in our own direct marketing efforts. We will determine the most effective method of distribution for each unique product that we include in our portfolio.
 
We intend to engage third party research and development firms who specialize in the creation of medical products to assist us in the development. We intend to apply for trademarks and patents as we develop proprietary products.
 
Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
We do not report our revenues or expenses by segment. See financial statements.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Once the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) clears us to market the CardioMap® and Save a Life products, we intend to enter into agreements with qualified distributors throughout the United States and world, including: Europe, South America, Africa, India and China. We intend to require such distributors to pay to our company an initial license fee as well as royalties based on gross sales. Retaining exclusivity, we will bill based on a mutually agreeable semi-annual or quarterly sales minimum. We have determined to focus on international growth because generally such international license agreements provide a stronger path to revenue and earnings than purely domestic products.
 
Our objective is to grow revenue through marketing and sales of each of our current products, CardioMap® and Save a Life. Although no assurances can be given, management anticipates company growth from the following areas:
 

1) | Distribution or License Agreements. In most cases, we will enter into distribution agreements with companies who already have sales professionals that already have experience selling through a variety of sales methods. These distribution agreements will allow us to more quickly achieve sales and revenue in the health products industries.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Generate revenues from sales of CardioMap® and Save a Life. We intend to market CardioMap® and Save a Life through third party distributors and through our own efforts. 
3) | Identify and develop CardioMap® for additional proprietary uses of the product. We intend to identify and find new areas of the human body to map utilizing CardioMap® technology such as the brain, liver and kidney. 
4) | The development and acquisition of new products. We intend to market any new products that may be developed or acquired. We intend to, as capital resources permit, develop such opportunities if and when they present themselves. 

 
About CardioMap®
 
The CardioMap® System will be an internet service based on the new development of Dispersion Mapping Method in ECG analysis for the early, non-invasive testing of coronary heart disease (CHD). The heart monitoring system is in a prototype stage and will provide high quality 3-D visualization and diagnosis of the heart using advanced signal analysis.

The Company owns technology and the marketing and distribution rights related to CardioMap®. CardioMap® measures disease or stress levels, along with current heart conditions as a 3D image supplementing the line drawing electrocardiogram (ECG), but with device sensitivity that surpasses standard ECG analyzers. It is highly portable and provides a rapid analysis in 30 or 60 seconds. The device is connected through the Internet to the central server that converts the electric conductivity of the cardiac tissue into a three-dimensional, color-coded and easy-to-interpret visual portrait. The CardioMap® is in advanced prototype stages of development and is not yet cleared by the FDA.
 
Once FDA cleared, CardioMap® could provide a better level of diagnosis with its improved sensitivity levels that can detect early warning signs that would normally be invisible with standard ECG devices. The system can dramatically cut the costs associated with the detection of ischemic heart disease and could prove to be an invaluable testing device for cardiologists, physicians, clinics, hospitals, the fitness industry, sports teams, emergency facilities and general public. CardioMap® was developed by VE Science Technology LLC, from whom we have purchased the product rights.
 
About Save a Life Choking Rescue Device
 
On June 27, 2019, Odyssey entered into a Definitive Agreement with Dr. James De Luca (“De Luca”), inventor and Murdock Capital Partners (“MCP”), advisors to De Luca, to acquire the intellectual property, know-how and patents for a life-saving medical device currently in development. The Company acquired intellectual property rights, namely, United States Letters Patent No. 7,559,921, entitled “Device for Removing a Lodged Mass” which issued on July 14, 2009 and which was reissued on June 2, 2015 and received U.S. Reissue Patent No. Re 45,535 and United States Patent Number 8,454,624 also entitled “Device for Removing a Lodged Mass” which was issued on June 4, 2013.
 
As consideration for the patent and intellectual property, the Company granted stock options totaling 600,000 shares of the Company’s stock, vesting on certain milestones. The options will be split between De Luca and MCP. The Company also granted Dr. De Luca, 20,000 common shares of stock. Upon commercial sales of the product, the Company will also pay a three percent (3%) royalty on the net profit of each device sold, once it is approved by all necessary regulatory bodies.
 
The Save a Life (“SAL”) Choking Rescue Device will be the only FDA cleared device that uses a patented “Negative Pressure” design to dislodge objects from the throat. It is an instantaneous, one step action that anyone can operate. A working prototype has been tested successfully in the lab. A development program for further refining the design and submitting for FDA clearance has been created. In June 2019, the Company acquired the issued patents number RE45, 535 E and patent number 8,454,624 B2 for the choking rescue device.
 
The Company believes its choking rescue device will quickly become the “accepted” standard and leader in the treatment of choking incidents globally. The Company’s device is designed to quickly, safely and economically address a medical situation that occurs often, is indiscriminate of time and place, is complex, time-sensitive, and if treated incorrectly can cause unintended or unexpected injury and even death.
 
The Save a Life choking rescue device is a patented, safe, and easy to use for removing a lodged mass or bolus from the throat of a choking victim. The device includes a pump for creating a vacuum chamber which is connected seamlessly with a replaceable/disposable mouthpiece. In an emergency the SAL may be easily inserted into the victim’s mouth which depresses the tongue providing a clear, trauma-free application. By pressing a button on the device, the device will deliver the appropriate amount of instantaneous vacuum to dislodge the mass or bolus in the throat without harm or damage to the victim. The application is instantly effective as the device is operational and effective in a matter of seconds.

The Save a Life has a number of advantages and features. The highlights are:
 

- | Easy to Use – The product is designed to be used by adults and children. The tongue depressor vacuum tube is inserted versus trying to place and keep a mask on a traumatized patient. Management also believes the product can be self-administered.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Smart Patented Design - The product is designed specifically to immobilize the palate from reflex spasm and open the air passage using a replaceable tongue depressor vacuum tube. A controlled vacuum action (manual or CO2 powered), with specific negative pressure, has been carefully calculated enabling the lifting of a lodged mass from the throat, so it may be ejected by reflexive coughing. This device utilizes a negative pressure to gently uplift the object from the larynx, at which point it will be coughed upward and outward reflexively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Used on Anyone – The SAL can be used on infants (20 months plus) to elderly adults. Also, it can be use on pregnant women and others who the Heimlich maneuver cannot help.

About Orphan Drugs for Niemann Picks and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”)
 
On June 27, 2019, Odyssey entered into a Definitive Agreement with Prevacus, Inc. (“Prevacus”), a biotechnology company, to form a Joint Venture (“JV”) relating to the development of a neurosteroid for treating two orphan disorders, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”) and Niemann Picks disease. Prevacus will contribute to the JV, the chemical compound and Odyssey will be responsible for funding the JV through Phase One clinical trials. The JV company will own the patents. Each party will own the JV company equally. In addition to the JV, the two companies have entered into a share exchange agreement whereby Prevacus will receive three million shares of Odyssey common stock and Odyssey will receive one million shares of Prevacus stock. The chemical compound for the neurosteroid being developed has issued patents, and as consideration for the patented compound, Odyssey will issue Prevacus two million shares of its common stock.
 
Prevacus, a leading biotech company in the area of neurological disorders and brain trauma has a neurosteroid compound intended to treat rare brain disorders, such as ALS, Niemann Pick’s disease, Krabbe’s Disease, Metachromatic Leukodystrophy and other leukodystrophies. These rare diseases are considered to have orphan drug status by the FDA. Orphan drug status is granted by the FDA and is intended to give companies that are researching cures for rare diseases that affect a small percentage of the population, a seven-year exclusive right to develop a cure and favorable tax considerations. The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development determines if a drug qualifies as an orphan product and drug status can be granted for new drugs, already approved drugs, or drugs that are already on the market.
 
The Prevacus and Odyssey joint venture will seek a solution to improve function and lifespan in pediatric disorders where de-myelination and cell death is widespread in the cortex and cerebellum regions of the brain. The new chemical entity is designed to work through gene amplification to simultaneously remove intra-neuronal debris while promoting antioxidant capacity and myelin repair/cell proliferation. Disorders like Niemann Pick Type C disease are multi-faceted in their pathology and require a treatment that can work at many levels to stop progression. The chemical compound for the neurosteroid being developed has issued patents. Toxicology studies have been performed and show a 380-fold safety margin. Preclinical efficacy studies show improvements in cognitive function and neuromotor performance.
 
Competition
 
We believe that the primary competition for our services is from existing companies offering EKG equipment and anti-choking devices, as well as other pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of Orphan drugs.
