Item 1. Business
Outbrain Inc., together with our subsidiaries, (“Outbrain,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) was incorporated in August 2006 in Delaware. The Company is headquartered in New York, New York with various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including in Israel, Europe and Asia.
On July 22, 2021, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-257525), filed on June 29, 2021, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with our initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock, and our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on July 23, 2021. On July 27, 2021, we closed our IPO and issued 8,000,000 shares of our common stock at an initial offering price of $20.00 per share, receiving aggregate net proceeds of $145.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. 
Our mission is to help people discover content, products and services.
Outbrain is a leading recommendation platform for advertisers and digital media owners, reaching over a billion unique users around the world. Outbrain’s technology provides personalization, engagement and monetization solutions to thousands of digital media properties, including many of the world’s most prestigious publishers. For tens of thousands of advertisers around the world, Outbrain helps attract new customers and grow their businesses, driving measurable results and return on investment.
Over the past decade, consumers have become increasingly accustomed to seeing highly curated digital content and ads that align with their unique interests. Similar to the way in which social media and search have simplified discovery by synthesizing billions of consumer data points to offer personalized experiences, we provide digital media owners with a platform that encompasses data at scale as well as prediction and recommendation capabilities, helping them deliver both editorial content and paid advertising based on context and each user’s interests and preferences. Additionally, as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny and consumer privacy advocacy, technologies such as ours, that rely primarily on context and first party data, have a unique advantage in building the future of online advertising.
Consumption of content continues to shift online, with over five billion consumers accessing the Internet, primarily through mobile devices, where scrolling through a feed experience is habitually expected by consumers on every page. According to the 2022 Digital News Report by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University, 77% of people access news through side-doors, not through the homepages of publications. We believe this means discovering content on article pages, on which we deliver user experiences, is more important than ever to help users navigate what to read, watch, or buy next.
Our platform is built for user engagement and, as a mobile-first company, is designed to be highly effective on mobile devices. Outbrain’s technology is deployed on the mobile apps and mobile websites of most of our media partners, generating 72% of our revenue in 2022. 
Outbrain operates a two-sided marketplace, which means we usually have exclusive control over all aspects of the user experience, allowing us to quickly test and deploy new formats for our advertisers and media owners. Since inception, we have been guided by the same core principles pertaining to our three constituents: users, media partners, and advertisers.
Users.  We believe that by focusing on improving the user experience and ad format innovation, we are able to cultivate user behavior patterns that compound engagement over time, delivering superior long-term monetization for ourselves and for our media partners, as well as better return on ad spend for our advertisers. 
Media Partners.  We are committed to the long-term success of our media partners. Consistent with this philosophy, we focus on establishing a true win-win partnership. We strive to develop trusted, transparent, multi-year relationships with media partners through contracts which are typically exclusive with us. Our media partners include both traditional publishers and companies in new and rapidly evolving categories such as mobile device manufacturers and web browsers.
Advertisers.  We offer a unique advertising solution across the entire advertising funnel, serving tens of thousands of advertisers and brands - from small businesses to large, Fortune 500 enterprise brands and the agencies that support them. Outbrain’s value proposition to advertisers is to deliver performance, or measurable engagement, that drives business outcomes - not limited to impressions, views, and reach. Our success in delivering user engagement stems from long-developed artificial intelligence (“AI”) and prediction capabilities that allow us to improve advertisers’ return on ad spend (“ROAS”) thus unlocking more advertising spend and attracting more advertisers. In turn, this enables us to better match ads to users and further grow user engagement and overall monetization. Additionally, our predictive algorithms can increasingly be leveraged to drive brand awareness and engagement objectives, especially with video and other high-impact formats.

We have delivered approximately $4.5 billion in direct revenue to our media partners since inception. We partner with thousands of the world’s most trusted digital media owners for which we believe we are an important technology and monetization partner. Some key media partners with which we have long-standing relationships across our various regions include Asahi Shimbun, CNN, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, MSN, Sky News and Sky Sports, and The Washington Post. In addition to these long-standing relationships, Axel Springer, Daily Mail and Fox News joined our platform on an exclusive basis in 2022. The average tenure of our top 20 media partners, based on our 2022 revenue, is over seven years. 
Through our direct, usually exclusive integrations with media partners, we have become one of the largest online advertising platforms on the open web. In 2022, we provided personalized recommendations and ads to over a billion monthly unique users, delivering on average nearly 12 billion recommendations to content, services and products per day, with over 30,000 advertisers directly using our platform.
Our platform is user engagement focused. We create and deliver highly engaging formats for our advertisers across native, display and video channels. In addition, a significant proportion of the engagement created by our platform is with the content of the media partner for which we are providing the platform, which we refer to as ‘organic recommendations.’ Outbrain is trusted to power organic recommendations across all publisher media types, including written editorial, video and audio content. This provides the user with a personalized content experience, while increasing time spent and engagement on the media partner’s digital properties. We believe this is crucial to increasing long-term loyalty and retention of users for media partners, while increasing the depth and value of user visits in the short term. Powering both organic recommendations and targeted ads creates significant proprietary, first-party data that enables us to continuously refine our prediction algorithms, supporting our efforts to further increase engagement.
Data and AI-based algorithms are fundamental to everything we do. We process billions of data signals per minute, powering more than 500 million Click Through Rate (“CTR”) predictions and over 100,000 recommendations per second. This drives our ability to deliver more than 40 million engagements per day. Our ability to collect and synthesize large data sets into our real-time decisioning engine powers our recommendations and our ad targeting, helping us optimize user engagement and monetization. As our platform grows, we are able to leverage our data scale in order to enhance our algorithms, enabling us to improve the efficacy of our platform. This, in turn, drives additional user engagement and thus more monetization for our partners and ourselves, which helps us further grow our business and scale our data. We refer to this phenomenon as our data flywheel. Engagements with our recommendations include user clicks on one of our recommendation links and views of a video that we recommended. We believe engagements are an indicator of the value users find in our recommendations and the value we create for our media partners through increased monetization.
We are targeting a large, fragmented and growing market. eMarketer states that approximately $567 billion was spent on global digital advertising in 2022, and by 2024, this figure is expected to increase to $696 billion. According to Statista, nearly 40% of the world’s population has yet to gain access to the Internet. As the migration to online takes place, there remains significant future growth potential in e-commerce, given that just 14.8% of total retail sales in the United States in 2022 occurred online, according to Statista. Online retail sales are both growing and fragmenting. We believe this represents an opportunity as the broader ecosystem of retailers seek advertising and technology partners to support their continued online growth. Advertisers increasingly expect measurable impact from their digital advertising investment, with spending on marketing analytics hitting an all-time high in 2022 and predicted to grow by 63% over the next three years, according to the 2022 CMO Survey. Given our ability to deliver high impact and measurable performance to our advertisers, as well as our significant reach and unique inventory, we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market.
Our Industry
Advertising is the primary business model for digital media on the open web. In addition, advertising is also increasingly used as a key revenue driver for other Internet based businesses, such as mobile gaming and e-commerce retailers. As a result, digital advertising not only subsidizes media consumption for billions of consumers globally, but also finances the creation of journalism, news, and entertainment, while lowering the costs to consumers of various products and services.
We believe that the following industry trends are relevant to our business:
Proliferation of digital media and digital advertising, particularly across mobile environments. As mentioned above, the consumption of content continues to shift to digital and primarily to mobile devices. In order to address this change, most media providers have shifted their focus from traditional means of content delivery to digital ones, with new ‘digital-native’ providers increasingly gaining attention. Advertising spend follows time spent and engagement, and mobile ad spend is expected to increase at a faster pace than digital ad spend in total. According to eMarketer, in 2022 global digital ad spend grew to $567 billion, an 8.6% year over year increase, and mobile ad spend grew to approximately $424 billion, a 12.1% year over year increase. According to Statista, the percentage of worldwide media ad spending in digital is estimated at 66.9% in 2022 and is projected to be 68.5% in 2023, growing to 73% by 2027.

Consumer habits and expectations are changing. Consumers have grown accustomed to consuming engaging content that is personalized and curated across multiple digital formats, including social, entertainment, gaming and audio. In mobile environments, consumers habitually scroll through apps, mobile browsers and news feeds, such as those found on social media, providing continuous opportunities to deliver personalized advertising experiences. As a result, we believe that personalized and engaging digital content experiences, supported by non-intrusive ads, have become the expectation of media owners, rather than a consumer luxury. 
Trusted editorial content is becoming increasingly important. The massive scale of content creation and distribution across social media has made it difficult to curb the creation and proliferation of factually inaccurate news and misinformation, leading to a growing distrust of user-generated social media content. A study by The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, published in September 2022, found that levels of trust in news on social media are consistently lower than audience trust in information in the news media more generally. We believe that this trend will continue. At the same time, advertisers are increasingly growing concerned about having their messages shown alongside unsavory user-generated content. As a result, advertisers have become increasingly cognizant of where they spend ad dollars, seeking media environments that prioritize quality, transparency and brand safety.
Performance and ROAS are important to advertisers. Following challenging global macroeconomic trends, advertisers across the advertising funnel are increasingly focused on high ROI campaigns that deliver on measurable performance objectives. As advertising spend becomes more accountable to key business metrics, technology platforms that deliver on engagement and performance are more relevant than ever. Furthermore, the ability to target advertising based on specific user interests and context, in real-time, has become increasingly important to advertisers, as it contributes to more efficient campaigns and improved ROAS. This creates demand for solutions that can adjust in real-time while measuring and optimizing for specific price and performance thresholds. As tools for targeting and tracking become more sophisticated and effective, advertisers are increasingly relying on performance centric pricing models to drive more measurable ROAS, for example, paying for a click (cost-per-click), lead, acquisition, download, install, or sale, instead of paying to simply display an ad which may or may not create value. Many advertisers, including the largest brands, leverage third-party software and predictive data-driven models to meet their performance goals. In parallel, increasingly user friendly and engagement-focused formats of digital advertising have evolved to better serve advertisers seeking performance and ROAS. In particular, video is a fast-growing segment of online advertising spend that has the potential to combine high impact formats and creative experiences with the more measurable engagement and business outcomes for advertisers. 
Data-driven decisioning delivers better experiences and outcomes. Advances in AI models, software and hardware, along with the growing use of the Internet have made it possible to collect and rapidly process massive amounts of real-time data signals related to content, context and performance, and incorporate those signals into prediction algorithms like ours. Leveraging data at scale, advertising technology providers can dynamically serve content or ads that integrate seamlessly into user environments to deliver tailored, impactful experiences. The decisioning intelligence developed by leading technology providers and large Internet platforms has made advertising more engaging for users and more effective for advertisers. As a result, advertisers are increasingly focused on data-driven decisioning, making these capabilities critical for media partners, as they seek to deliver quality experiences to their users while maintaining their relevance with advertisers.
The Challenge for Digital Media Owners
As the pace of online content creation and consumption continues to accelerate, and competition for user attention intensifies, digital media owners must focus on their core strength: creating relevant, interesting, quality content. However, their success also depends on sustainably attracting, engaging, retaining and monetizing audiences while competing with the major social and aggregation platforms, known as the ‘walled gardens.’ These platforms, driven by the nature of their services and their scale, have significant resources to invest in technology and have amassed large volumes of coveted user data, enabling them to deliver highly targeted and thus effective ads alongside user generated or third-party content, helping them achieve an outsized share of the advertising market.
As a result, we believe that digital media owners, whose properties are often referred to as the ‘open web,’ face challenges in the following key areas:
User experience. In today’s dynamic, mobile-first environment, providing a high-quality user experience that addresses consumer habits and expectations is critical to attracting, engaging and retaining audiences. For example, over the past few years, consumers have grown accustomed to receiving personalized content recommendations, which are now common within the walled gardens. In addition, infinite scrolling feeds of content have also become popular, especially on mobile devices. Keeping pace with these changes, as well as other emerging products and features, represents a significant challenge to many digital media owners who lack the scale and resources required to compete.

Monetization. The fragmented ecosystem of digital advertising technology intermediaries, constantly evolving landscape of ad formats and the growing sophistication of advertisers seeking measurable ROAS makes it difficult for digital media owners to develop and maintain the technology required to optimize their monetization. In addition, digital media owners often lack access to a large and diverse advertiser base. As a result, they may not benefit from the variety of ads that are necessary in order to optimize consumer engagement and thus overall monetization. New technologies such as Keystone by Outbrain™ seek to optimize revenue for media owners across not just advertising, but subscription revenue, e-commerce revenue, and other sources of revenue with one holistic optimization algorithm.
Our Solution
We enable digital media owners to provide their users with an experience that is relevant to their interests while generating incremental revenue through highly engaging content recommendations and relevant advertisements. Our platform is informed by large, proprietary data sets. Our recommendation engine relies on advanced artificial intelligence technology and machine learning algorithms. We leverage our scale, gained through a large number of media partners and advertisers, to continuously grow and enhance our unique data and our technology.
By delivering relevant recommendations, alongside targeted ads, our platform increases and monetizes user engagement. Our technology platform forms the underlying “operating system” of our media partners’ content feeds and other placements, optimizing the user journey and helping them manage and grow their business.

Outbrain typically provides media partners with close to a 100% fill rate of the ad inventory managed by Outbrain; we believe that Outbrain’s role as an end-to-end solution, working directly with both media owners and advertisers, provides an economic advantage for our partners.
•Maximize user engagement.  Our solution enables media partners to engage and retain their audience, helping them achieve multiple business outcomes such as time spent with their content, growth of digital subscriptions, app downloads, and more. In addition, Smartlogic optimization engine is an always-on testing and optimization solution that continuously enhances page layouts for maximum engagement and value.
•Manage their business.  Our solution includes a dashboard enabling media partners to manage and control certain aspects of our platform including the content, formats, sources, frequency and categories of ads delivered on their properties, while simultaneously considering our media partner key performance indicators (“KPIs”). In addition, we provide precise advertiser and creative classification and filtering tools while strictly enforcing rigorous ad and content quality requirements by the media partner. We operate at great scale, with hundreds of thousands of new ads uploaded to our platform daily. We have processes and technology to review ads, either through our automated processes or manually, in a process designed to ensure compliance with our content guidelines (which are available publicly on our website). Our extensive ad processes and automated monitoring tools provide a further layer of quality control for our media partners.
With the launch of Keystone by Outbrain in 2022, media owners can now use Outbrain’s technology to optimize across all of their digital media properties and across all their business goals, not just advertising revenues and editorial recommendations. This platform enables them to maximize revenue from growing sources of revenues such as subscriptions, e-commerce, events, and any other revenue-generating activity that is relevant to their business. By optimizing the user journey and internal campaigns, Keystone by Outbrain enables a more holistic management of overall revenue initiatives for media owners that are increasingly focused on revenue diversification.

We have thousands of media partner arrangements. We document most of our media partner arrangements using standard contract terms, which are comprised of a partner enrollment form, completed by media partners seeking our services, that hyperlinks to our publicly available standard partner distribution terms. The partner enrollment form contains the commercial terms of our arrangements: term length (initial, auto-renewal and notice period), the specified percentage of the revenue earned from implementing our technology on the media partner pages, the payment terms, as well as any additional terms agreed upon by the parties. The hyperlinked standard partner distribution terms include terms related to the license and use of the platform and technology, limitations on use of similar technologies, and customary terms and conditions. 
In addition, certain media partner arrangements include additional commercial terms such as variable revenue percentages based on page view volume or revenue, or a guaranteed minimum rate of payment if the media partner meets certain additional criteria, including the implementation of advertisement spaces in defined placements across the media partner sites. We also have arrangements with media partners on a programmatic basis such that the contract defines the mechanics to participate in the media partner’s real-time auction for access to the media partner’s inventory, with neither party committing to provide or bid on inventory. The type of commercial terms, such as revenue percentages, tiering of such percentages, guaranteed minimum rates of payment or programmatic are all factors, among others such as geography and size of the media partners, that contribute to our revenue mix. 
Our Offering for Advertisers
Our platform enables advertisers to have one-on-one interactions with consumers, at scale. We provide advertisers with a powerful platform with significant reach and exclusive inventory on the open web, helping them connect with audiences on premium digital properties around the world. Our platform enables advertisers to launch and run campaigns on a self-service basis or as a fully managed service offering for larger enterprise brands and the agencies that support them, via our own campaign management and demand side solution or via a third party demand side platform. 
Outbrain provides advertisers with:
•Seamless and non-intrusive ad formats.  We provide advertisers with access to ad inventory that benefits from high user attention by delivering ads that are native to the user experience and are personalized based on our unique data and understanding of each user’s context and interests. We support a variety of formats, including text and image native ads, outstream video, pre-roll video ads, interactive carousel, app install ads and other forms of display and rich-media ads.
Table of Contents

•Ads optimized for engagement.  Our deep and direct integration across the digital properties of thousands of media partners provides us with a wealth of proprietary data pertaining to user engagement and content consumption patterns. This enables us to deliver ads based on our proprietary user graph, as well as other unique data-driven tools and technologies. We believe that our direct integrations and exclusive partnerships are a differentiator when compared to most other online advertising solutions. Unlike other solutions, which often connect an advertiser to an available ad opportunity in a non-exclusive manner, typically mediated by other third-party platforms and technologies, our platform benefits from direct visibility into users’ overall engagement.
•Results—optimize and pay for performance.  Our platform enables advertisers to optimize to specific campaign goals, and buy on a Cost-per-Click basis, guaranteeing engagement and delivering other measurable business outcomes. Advertisers are able to view progress, manage ongoing campaigns and maximize ROAS. Our AI-based autopilot feature enables advertisers to set their varied goals and KPIs, such as conversion goals, and the platform automatically optimizes bid prices and budget allocations to hit these goals. 
•Programmatic Access.  We provide a full suite of programmatic buying capabilities for advertisers and agencies. We offer advertisers an engagement focused programmatic demand side platform (DSP) Zemanta, and in addition we integrate with most of the leading third-party DSPs to provide access to our marketplace. We are continually investing in partnerships with programmatic technologies to better deploy, measure, and optimize programmatic campaigns.
•Quality.  We work with established media partners, employing rigorous selection criteria, onboarding standards, controls, processes, and ongoing monitoring. As a result, our platform provides predominantly exclusive access to engaged users in high quality content environments across many of the world’s most trusted media properties.

Our Personalized Experience for Users
Our Smartlogic product dynamically adjusts both the arrangement and the formats of content delivered to a user, depending on the user’s preferences and our media partner’s KPIs, ensuring a more personalized and engaging experience while providing a balance of editorial engagement and monetization. It leverages machine learning to personalize not just the content, but the entire user experience, including the format of ads, ordering and more.
Our recommendation solution drives deeper discovery of content, products and services, longer sessions, and better user engagement. We power the content feeds of thousands of digital media owners, combining highly engaging multimedia formats, such as text and image, or video, with a diverse range of experiences and dynamic optimizations, continuously improving a personalized user experience.
Our Strengths
•Mission-critical partner for digital media owners.  We provide digital media partners with mission-critical technology, an “operating system,” that is designed to increase user engagement and content monetization. The capabilities and revenue we provide enable many of our partners to sustain their businesses and deliver quality journalism, in some cases as they continue a long-term transition away from historic reliance on offline ad revenue. 
•Unique, at-scale end-to-end platform for advertisers.  Through our vast and predominantly exclusive relationships with media partners, we provide advertisers with access to over a billion monthly unique users. The breadth of our audience reach enables advertisers to deliver at-scale campaigns and to optimize the performance of their advertising spend.
•Unique proprietary data and algorithms driving a virtuous cycle.  Our direct integrations across our partners’ properties provide us with a large volume of proprietary first-party engagement data, including context, user interest and behavioral signals. Leveraging our data, we continuously optimize our algorithms to improve user engagement and advertiser ROAS. By delivering better results to advertisers, we are able to grow our business and our platform, which, in turn, helps us collect more data and further enhance our algorithms, driving better results for our partners, helping us further grow our platform and our business.
•Well positioned for a privacy-centric world.  By integrating directly with our media partners’ properties, we generate proprietary first-party data and are able to collect and infer valuable user related data and insights. With the upcoming discontinuation of third-party cookies and confusion about the efficacy of any new approaches, marketers are looking for more enduring ways to understand their customers. Our ability to extract and leverage unique contextual signals enables us to deliver strong user engagement and advertiser ROAS without the need to rely solely on cookie-based targeting that may not be available in the future.

•History of successful innovation.  We pioneered our category and have been focused on innovation since our founding. To ensure seamless product innovation we operate as a continuous deployment engineering organization, releasing an average of over 300 code deployments daily. We plan to continue investing in our technology stack, platform and its capabilities.
•Scaled, profitable and diversified business.  We have grown our business while achieving profitability, demonstrating the power and scalability of our technology, the strength of our partner and advertiser relationships and the inherent operating leverage of our model. Our business is well diversified. In 2022 our top twenty digital media partners accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue, with the largest accounting for 10% of our revenue. During the same year, our top twenty advertisers accounted for approximately 20% of our revenue, with the largest accounting for approximately 2% of our revenue. 
•Team and culture.  Companies cannot effect the change they aspire to achieve without passionate, innovative employees. We rely on a global and diverse team of highly capable employees to collaborate, innovate, and execute our vision—to empower high quality journalism and content creation. Outbrain routinely conducts anonymous employee engagement surveys; according to the survey in August 2022, which had a 91% employee participation rate, 82% of our employees responded that they would recommend Outbrain as a great place to work.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of digital content consumption and digital advertising. We intend to continue investing in technology and innovation to improve our recommendation engine and product offering, support our efforts to grow relationships with existing and new media partners, and expand our advertiser footprint and share of wallet. We plan to pursue the following growth strategies:
•Continuously improve user engagement.  Improving the quality of our recommendation engine has been an important driver of past growth and we expect it to remain a key driver of future growth. We believe that a great user experience drives engagement that compounds over time. Continued investment in our technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities drives a better user experience, resulting in better CTR predictions and, in turn, higher monetization yield and revenue. We believe that we can significantly grow our business solely by improving user engagement.
•Grow our ad inventory.  We have an extensive history of growing ad inventory by expanding our media partnerships and forming new ones with an emphasis on premium, top 20 media owners in the markets where we operate.
Existing partners.  We have a strong track record of growth through the continuous expansion of existing media partnerships, as we launched products, features and formats that improved user engagement and retention, grew audiences, and improved monetization. We plan to continue innovating as we seek to grow our ad inventory by implementing optimizations, creating new ad formats, seeking additional high impact ad placements, and pursuing opportunities to manage a larger proportion of our media partners’ digital properties through both direct integrations and programmatic relationships. In addition, we plan to expand our partnerships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), enabling us to offer personalized content feeds and advertising solutions for different platforms such as browsers and mobile operating systems.
New partners.  We plan to pursue new partnerships with media owners as well as integrations with programmatic platforms that will expand our reach to additional user segments, helping us grow our business.
•Grow advertiser spend.  We plan to grow spend from existing, as well as new advertisers by pursuing the following initiatives: 
◦Further invest in our advertiser product suite.  In the past, improvements to our advertiser solutions have been a meaningful driver of growth for our business. We plan to continue investing in our media buying platforms, Amplify and Zemanta engagement DSP, as well as optimize our existing programmatic integrations to third party DSPs, in order to deliver better tools and technologies for advertisers on our platform.
◦Continuously improve ROAS.  We aim to deliver better results for advertisers through improved CTR, as well as automation in pricing and conversion optimization through our autopilot AI-based solution, helping us grow the existing and new advertisers’ share of wallet.

◦Grow brand spend with high impact ad formats.  With the introduction of our brand studio and the acquisition of the vi video advertising platform in 2022, we are able to expand our existing suite of solutions aimed at brand advertisers looking to drive high-impact and highly engaging experiences. The addition of pre-roll video ads to our platform presents a significant growth opportunity in video. From 2018 to 2022, we grew video revenues from approximately 2% to approximately 10% of our annual revenue, with significant remaining headroom for growth into a higher yielding business.
We believe that we will be able to capture significant spend from new and existing brand advertisers by providing, amongst others, new capabilities, such as additional exclusive ad placements, creative brands studio, new optimization solutions, and unique ad formats delivering measurable outcomes.
◦Attract new types of advertisers.  In addition to investments in our advertiser product and technology, we plan to invest in sales and marketing initiatives aimed at attracting new types of advertisers to our platform. Our focus on premium media partnerships and display and video formats enable us to form new business relationships with advertisers who traditionally have not spent with Outbrain. We believe that Zemanta’s programmatic offerings will gain adoption amongst leading agencies and brands looking for an alternative DSP that delivers on engagement goals, and that new programmatic demand partners will enable us to continue to expand our brand advertiser footprint. 
◦Deepen strategic value to media partners. With the launch of Keystone by Outbrain in 2022, media owners can now use Outbrain’s technology to optimize across all of their business goals, not just advertising and editorial recommendations. This enables them to maximize revenue from growing sources such as subscriptions, e-commerce, events, and any other revenue-generating activity that is relevant to their business. While our core product remains focused on maximizing advertising revenue and editorial engagement, Keystone by Outbrain enables a more holistic management of overall revenue for media owners increasingly focused on revenue diversification.
◦Acquisitions and strategic partnerships. We have a track record of successfully executing a number of acquisitions and partnerships, helping us efficiently expand our offerings, grow our business and grow our talent. In 2017, we acquired Zemanta, providing us with advanced programmatic capabilities. In 2018, we acquired AdNgin, an advanced user interface optimization platform. In 2019, we acquired Ligatus, a German-based native advertising company. In January 2022, we acquired video intelligence AG, providing us with an expanded video offering for advertisers and media owners. We intend to continue pursuing partnership and acquisition opportunities that will enhance our technology or market presence and deliver more value to our partners and advertisers.

Our platform consists of the following key technology components:
•Infrastructure.  To support our business needs, we operate our own proprietary cloud infrastructure, and also utilize other public clouds. Our proprietary infrastructure includes over 7,000 servers, with storage capacity exceeding several petabytes. Our servers are primarily located in three third-party data centers, on a co-location basis, in Secaucus, NJ, Sacramento, CA, and Chicago, IL. Each of our data centers is operated by a different vendor, in order to minimize the impact of any outage on our platform. While all three data centers actively serve recommendations to users, we are able to serve all of our traffic from two of the three data centers if needed. We utilize a global content delivery network (CDN), and dynamic acceleration, for additional performance optimization and redundancy. In 2022, we also started serving recommendations from a public cloud based in the Netherlands to countries in Europe. We use similar architecture as our primary third-party data centers and deploy over two availability zones for high availability.
Our infrastructure is designed such that we do not have any known single point of failure at any level. Within each data center, we have load-balanced servers on each layer of the system, so that a failure in one server or component will not impact performance or availability. Some of these clusters are dedicated to handling incoming traffic and delivering content, including web servers, caches and real-time database applications. Other clusters are devoted to the data analytics and algorithm modeling involved in creating content recommendations. The design also includes load balancers, firewalls and routers that connect the components and provide connections to the Internet. In particular, we use software specifically designed for processing large data sets to provide real-time data analysis, the results of which are then fed back to refresh and improve our recommendation algorithms.
We monitor our system using several tools, both internal and external, to gauge our uptime and performance. We also use multiple layered security controls to protect our recommendation engine and our data assets, including software-based access controls for our source code and production systems, segregated networks for different components of our production systems and centralized production systems management. We believe that the failure of any individual component will not affect the overall availability of our platform, having maintained an uptime of 99.9% from 2018 to 2022.
•Data.  One of the key benefits of our platform is the management, analysis, and structuring of valuable user engagement and advertising data. 
◦Our data scale:   We gather billions of data events per minute delivering nearly 12 billion recommendations per day. On average, we collect in excess of 80 terabytes of data per day consisting of contextual signals, advertiser data, and user engagement data (typically clicks on recommendations). We leverage our data to improve our algorithms and prediction capabilities. 
◦Our automated content index:  To operate our platform, we have created our automated content index, comprising over 5 billion content elements. Our technology automatically classifies and analyzes content at a rate of over 1.5 million pages a day in 20 different languages. We index content through RSS feeds and JavaScript triggers to continuously identify new content and changes to existing content. Our automated index deconstructs content into base elements including titles, images and topics in order to recombine the elements into targeting data and formatted recommendations and ads.
•Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  Our proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities enable us to harness the vast volume of data we collect in order to effectively match users to relevant content and ads based on our content index. Our algorithms make over 1,000 click and conversion rate predictions, on average, before selecting which recommendations to present on each page view.

Our Data Flywheel
Sales and Marketing
We focus our sales and marketing efforts on supporting, advising, and training our partners and advertisers, helping them optimize their use of our platform. We employ in-market sales teams across our markets, helping us attract premium digital media owners and advertisers to our platform. In addition, we have developed and currently utilize online acquisition channels to attract new advertisers, who we are able to onboard and serve in an automated manner, using self-serve tools and technologies.
Our sales teams educate prospective media owners, partners, and advertisers on the use, technical capabilities, and benefits of our platform. Our dedicated teams work with potential customers through the entire sale cycle, from initial contact to contract execution and implementation. Throughout the process, our teams provide guidance as to how our platform can optimize the value of a media partner’s audience or how an advertiser can reach relevant users. Additionally, following contract execution and implementation, our account management teams guide media partners on how additional platform deployment and optimizations can deliver incremental monetization. We engage advertisers and their agencies in order to educate them on how to increase reach and ROAS using our solutions.
Our marketing team is focused on delivering strategies that drive efficient new partner and advertiser acquisition, enhancing our position as key industry thought leaders, supporting our sales teams, and increasing awareness of our brand.
Human Capital Resources
Much of our success can be directly attributed to our global team of technology, business, and data science experts who work out of our 17 locations worldwide. Outbrain comprises a diverse, intelligent and driven group of individuals who are passionate and excited to be leading the way in which users discover things online.
Our culture and team are the most important assets in building and expanding our business. Our team identifies new problems to solve, builds solutions, optimizes and extends our infrastructure, and acquires and serves customers. We believe that strong and diverse teams deepen customer relationships, promote innovation, and increase productivity. Our Culture Manifesto, available publicly on the Outbrain website, is one of many important expressions of the values and principles that reflect how we behave, collectively and individually.
Our people strategy revolves around creating employee experiences. We strive to foster deep employee engagement built upon personal development and achievement that is supported by continuous feedback, learning, and team building. As we continue growing our team, and become more diverse culturally and geographically, we want to make sure we retain a shared mission among the people that become part of our company. In particular, there are certain characteristics that we seek out in our employees:
Table of Contents

•Intelligent and productive.   There are many great attributes companies can seek in the candidates they hire—academic degrees, deep industry expertise, hands-on work experience, etc. While these attributes are an important part of our screening process, we seek, above all else, a combination of smarts and a “get stuff done” attitude.
•Collaborative.   We love hiring and nurturing professionals who are great at their craft. At the same time, we are cognizant that we are ultimately playing a team sport and we therefore look for people who strive to be amazing team players. A self-described “Superstar” or “Ninja” focused on personal status is not likely to fit our team, even if they might be very good at their profession.
•Passionate.   People who have a passion for something typically have that spark in their eyes when they engage in the work they love. They bring their best self to work, possess the desire to improve and learn, and focus on opportunities rather than obstacles. Through their passion, they set the tone for the rest of the team and become excellent examples for everyone to follow.
We also strive to make Outbrain diverse at all levels of the Company, and in all types of jobs. Our priority is to always hire and promote people based on qualifications and merit, and we believe that this approach does not conflict with the objectives of inclusion and empowerment. Our team consists of people from many different nationalities and cultures with different perspectives, opinions and ideas which we believe is undeniably powerful and ultimately drives shareholder value. We support employee-led employee resource groups ("ERGs"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We currently have four ERGs: OB Good, OB Green, OB WE and OB-4-Equality, focusing on social responsibility, environmental sustainability, women's empowerment, and diversity equity and inclusion, respectively, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,076 employees and contractors. Based on where data is available, approximately 51% were male and approximately 47% were female. Approximately 41% of our workforce is located in Israel, 13% is located in the United States, 11% is located in Slovenia, and the remaining 35% is located in our other global offices. In March 2020, we transitioned to remote work, with selective offices returning on a hybrid basis where conditions related to COVID-19 permitted. In 2022, we returned to our offices using a hybrid model, with employees working from both our office locations and their homes.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal and state statutory and common law rights, foreign laws where applicable, and contractual restrictions. We seek to control access to our proprietary technology by entering into non-disclosure agreements with third parties and disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors.
We consider our trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. In addition to our intellectual property rights, we also consider the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions to be contributors to our success. We believe our platform would be difficult, time consuming, and costly to replicate. We protect our competitive technology position through innovation and by continually developing new intellectual property.
Outbrain has built an extensive intellectual property portfolio to date. This portfolio includes 18 granted U.S. utility patents, 35 granted U.S. design patents and 15 European registered community designs.
Regulatory Environment 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted or enforced in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, accessibility, taxation, and economic or other trade controls including sanctions, and securities law compliance. Foreign laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, may impose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services that could significantly increase our compliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. More generally, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.

Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities have caused us, and in the future will continue to cause us, to incur substantial costs and expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies). Such orders, inquiries or enforcement actions could be materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. 
We have been subject to significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we implemented a number of changes and controls as a result of requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions of regulators are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan and Singapore and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or result in fines or other penalties. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. In addition, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business. The enactment of new proposed laws is gaining momentum and adds additional complexity to our and our partners’ compliance programs.
We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including the collection of data and the data shared between countries or regions in which we operate. If we are unable to collect data and/or transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union and the other bases upon which we rely to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. If no alternative adequacy decision, such as E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, is adopted by the European Commission, or we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs, this would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Interest-based advertising specifically, or the use of data to draw inferences about a consumer’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that consumer, is under increasing scrutiny by legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, self-regulatory bodies, privacy advocates, academics, and the press in the United States and abroad. In particular, much of this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies that collect or aggregate information regarding consumers’ online browsing and mobile app activity. Our Company, our media partners and advertisers rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies and other tracking technologies. It is essential that we monitor legal requirements and other developments in this area, both domestically and globally, maintain a robust privacy and security compliance program, anticipate the evolution of regulations applicable to us and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect, how we collect it, with whom we share it, how we use that data to provide our solutions and how consumers can exercise their rights and personalization choices. We typically collect IP addresses and device identifiers that are considered to be personal data or personal information under the privacy laws of some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of current or future data privacy legislation or regulation. The definition of personally identifiable information, personal information, or personal data varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to comply with laws and regulations related to the collection, storage, use, and sharing of consumer data. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly against a continuously evolving legal, regulatory, and technology landscape. 
Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data. We are members in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), an association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising. We adhere to the NAI Code of Conduct, along with the IAB Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, and the IAB Europe OBA Framework. We are also Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) Brand Safety Certified. We are participants in the Digital Advertising Alliance and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance and adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by these organizations. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to review or sanction members or participants, which could result in penalties and cause reputational harm. Additionally, some of these bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulators.

Security
Being a trusted partner is a key value for us and, as such, cyber security is an ongoing commitment. Our dedicated cyber security team has implemented industry best practices and standards including, but not limited to, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27032, Cloud Security Alliance Star level 1, and PCI-DSS SAQ A-EP, SOC 2 data centers. In addition to our certifications, we (i) conduct routine employee training sessions and onboarding security training, including phishing simulation, to increase awareness of phishing and other cyber threats; (ii) require multi-factor authentication access methods for all employees into our network; (iii) operate general monitoring and service protections that are subject to continuous enhancements to detect and mitigate various threats, including performing ongoing manual and automatic vulnerability assessment tests; and (iv) manage an ongoing cyber risk-management framework to assess internal technological changes, as well as external systems and services as part of supply chain risk.
Our products are designed with security and privacy at the forefront. We maintain tight controls over the personal data we collect, encrypting it where necessary, and retaining it in our databases with strictly limited and controlled access rights, to ensure it is secure while utilizing advanced monitoring over our environment. All traffic to and between our data centers is encrypted, along with all sensitive configurations, while our users and customers have their passwords hashed.
Secure advertising is a building block of user trust. In order to provide secure ads, we integrated an advanced industry leading third-party technology to scan live ads looking for potential security violations either in the ads themselves or on the pages to which they directly link. Combined with internally developed capabilities and our content review process we are tackling both malicious ads and the bad actors behind them.
We constantly strive to understand what we have yet to discover by running an exhaustive security testing framework, including scanning all internal and external assets for vulnerabilities, utilizing multiple third-party security testing teams every year, and running a bug bounty program with more than 300 security researchers.
Providing a clean, non-fraudulent premium network for publishers, advertisers and consumers is a top priority at Outbrain. Our dedicated anti-fraud team monitors our platform to identify and investigate unusual web traffic patterns. We detect, block and prevent fraudulent web traffic by using both internal and external third-party TAG Anti-Fraud certified solutions. We have been a TAG-verified member since 2018. We are also adopting the Media Rating Council Invalid Traffic Detection and Filtration Standards in our internal fraud detection technological ecosystem.
