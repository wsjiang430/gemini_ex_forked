Item 1. Business
 
Marine Products manufactures fiberglass motorized boats distributed and marketed through its independent dealer network. Marine Products’ product offerings include Chaparral sterndrive, outboard and jet pleasure boats and Robalo outboard sport fishing boats.
 
Organization and Overview
 
Marine Products is a Delaware corporation incorporated on August 31, 2000, in connection with a spin-off from RPC, Inc. (NYSE: RES) (“RPC”). Effective February 28, 2001, RPC accomplished the spin-off by contributing 100 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of Chaparral to Marine Products, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of RPC, and then distributing the common stock of Marine Products to RPC stockholders.
 
Marine Products designs, manufactures and sells recreational fiberglass powerboats in the sportboat, deckboat, cruiser, jet boat and sport fishing markets. The Company sells its products to a network of 168 domestic and 86 international independent authorized dealers. Marine Products’ mission is to enhance its customers’ boating experience by providing them with high quality, innovative powerboats. The Company intends to remain a leading manufacturer of recreational powerboats for sale to a broad range of consumers worldwide.
 
The Company manufactures Chaparral sterndrive pleasure boats including H2O Sport and Fish & Ski boats, SSi and SSX Sportboats, Sunesta Sportdecks, and Signature Cruisers, as well as SunCoast Sportdeck outboards, Vortex jet boats and the Surf Series, a line of Chaparral models first introduced for the 2018 model year. The most recent available industry statistics [source: Statistical Surveys, Inc. report dated September 30, 2018] indicate that Chaparral is the largest manufacturer of sterndrive boats in lengths from 19 to 34 feet in the United States.
 
Chaparral was founded in 1965 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Chaparral’s first boat was a 15-foot tri-hull design with a retail price of less than $1,000. Over time Chaparral grew by offering exceptional quality and consumer value. In 1976, Chaparral moved to Nashville, Georgia, where a manufacturing facility of a former boat manufacturing company was available for purchase. This provided Chaparral an opportunity to obtain additional manufacturing space and access to a trained workforce. With 54 years of boatbuilding experience, Chaparral continues to expand the range of its offerings through insightful product design and quality manufacturing processes in order to reach an increasingly discerning recreational boating market.
 
The Company also manufactures Robalo outboard sport fishing boats. Robalo was founded in 1969 and its first boat was a 19-foot center console salt-water fishing boat, among the first of this type of boat to have an “unsinkable” hull. The Company believes that Robalo is the second largest manufacturer of outboard boats in lengths from 16 to 31 feet in the United States.

Manufacturing
 
Marine Products’ manufacturing facilities are located in Nashville, Georgia. Marine Products utilizes five different plants to, among other things, manufacture interiors, design new models, create fiberglass hulls and decks, and assemble various end products. Quality control is conducted throughout the manufacturing process. When fully assembled and inspected, the boats are loaded onto either Company-owned trailers or third-party marine transport trailers for delivery to dealers. The manufacturing process begins with the design of a product to meet dealer and customer needs. Plugs are constructed in the research and development phase from designs. Plugs are used to create a mold from which prototype boats can be built. Adjustments are made to the plug design until acceptable parameters are met. The final plug is used to create the necessary number of production molds. Molds are used to produce the fiberglass hulls and decks. Fiberglass components are made by applying the outside finish or gel coat to the mold, then numerous layers of fiberglass and resin are applied during the lamination process over the gel coat. After curing, the hull and deck are removed from the molds and are trimmed and prepared for final assembly, which includes the installation of electrical and plumbing systems, engines, upholstery, accessories and graphics.
Product Warranty
 
For our Chaparral and Robalo products, Marine Products provides a lifetime limited structural hull warranty and a transferable one-year limited warranty to the original owner. Chaparral also includes a five-year limited structural deck warranty. Warranties for additional items are provided for periods of one to five years and are not transferrable. Additionally, as it relates to the first subsequent owner, a five-year transferrable hull warranty and the remainder of the original one-year limited warranty on certain components are available. The five-year transferable hull warranty terminates five years after the date of the original retail purchase. Claim costs related to components are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer.
 
The manufacturers of the engines, generators, and navigation electronics included on our boats provide and administer their own warranties for various lengths of time.

Suppliers
 
Marine Products’ three most significant cost components used in manufacturing its boats, are engines, resins and fiberglass. For each of these, there is currently an adequate supply available in the market. Marine Products has not experienced any significant shortages in any of these products. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mixes, introducing new product lines or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand. Import tariffs enacted during 2018 may cause disruptions in the availability of fiberglass, the largest supplier of which is in a county impacted by tariffs. Marine Products believes that there are several alternative suppliers if this supplier fails to provide adequate quality or quantities at acceptable prices.
 
Marine Products does not manufacture the engines installed in its boats. Engines are generally specified by the dealers at the time of ordering, usually on the basis of anticipated customer preferences or actual customer orders. Sterndrive engines are purchased through the American Boatbuilders Association (“ABA”), which has entered into engine supply arrangements with Mercury Marine and Volvo Penta, the two currently existing suppliers of sterndrive engines. These arrangements contain incentives and discount provisions, which may reduce the cost of the engines purchased, if specified purchase volumes are met during specified periods of time. Although no minimum purchases are required, Marine Products expects to continue purchasing sterndrive engines through the ABA on a voluntary basis in order to receive volume-based purchase discounts. Marine Products does not have a long-term supply contract with the ABA. Marine Products has an outboard engine supply contract with Yamaha and a jet engine supply contract with BRP US Inc. These engine supply arrangements were not negotiated through the ABA. In the event of a sudden and extended interruption in the supply of engines from any of these suppliers, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted. See “Risk Factors” below.
 
Marine Products uses other raw materials in its manufacturing processes. Among these are resins made from hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper and steel. The costs of these commodities have fluctuated significantly over the past several years in response to changes in global economic conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the costs of several of these materials have begun to increase. See “Inflation” below.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Domestic sales are generated through our independent dealer network of approximately 47 Chaparral dealers, 33 Robalo dealers and 88 dealers that sell both brands located in markets throughout the United States. Marine Products also has 86 international dealers. Most of our dealers also inventory and sell boat brands manufactured by other companies, including some that compete directly with our brands. The territories served by any dealer are not exclusive to the dealer; however, Marine Products uses discretion in establishing relationships with new dealers in an effort to protect the mutual interests of the existing dealers and the Company. Marine Products’ six independent field sales representatives call upon existing dealers and develop new dealer relationships. The field sales representatives are directed by a National Sales Coordinator, who is responsible for developing the dealer distribution network for the Company’s products. The marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer. Marine Products supports dealer marketing efforts by supplementing local advertising, sales and marketing follow up in boating magazines, and participation in selected regional, national, and international boat show exhibitions. No single dealer accounted for more than 10 percent of net sales during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
 
Marine Products continues to seek new dealers in many areas throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, Asia, Russia and the Middle East. In general, Marine Products requires full payment prior to shipping a boat overseas. Consequently, there is no credit risk associated with these international sales or risk related to foreign currency fluctuation. The Company’s international sales are affected by trends in consumer discretionary spending and the value of the U.S. dollar on global currency markets, among other things. During 2018, the Company’s international net sales were impacted by trade tariffs, most notably in Canada, Mexico and the European Union. While the volume of sales to international dealers as a percentage of total net sales increased slightly in 2018 compared to 2017, they decreased significantly towards the end of the year due to the impact of trade tariffs that were enacted during 2018. International net sales as a percentage of total net sales were 6.5 percent in 2018, 6.3 percent in 2017, and 8.8 percent in 2016.
 
Marine Products’ sales orders are indicators of strong interest from its dealers. Historically, dealers have in most cases taken delivery of all their orders. The Company attempts to ensure that its dealers do not accept an excessive amount of inventory by monitoring their inventory levels. Knowledge of inventory levels at the individual dealers facilitates production scheduling with shorter lead times in order to maintain flexibility in the event that adjustments need to be made to dealer shipments. In the past, Marine Products has been able to resell any boat for which an order has been cancelled.

Approximately 68 percent of Marine Products’ domestic shipments are made pursuant to “floor plan financing” programs in which Marine Products’ subsidiaries participate on behalf of their dealers with major third-party financing institutions. The remaining dealers finance their boat inventory with smaller regional financial institutions in local markets or pay cash. Under these established arrangements with qualified lending institutions, a dealer establishes a line of credit with one or more of these lenders for the purchase of boat inventory for sales to retail customers in their showroom or during boat show exhibitions. In general, when a dealer purchases and takes delivery of a boat pursuant to a floor plan financing arrangement, it draws against its line of credit and the lender pays the invoice cost of the boat directly to Marine Products generally within ten business days. When the dealer in turn sells the boat to a retail customer, the dealer repays the lender, thereby restoring its available credit line. Each dealer’s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer’s inventory, letters of credit, and perhaps other personal and real property. Until recently, most dealers maintained financing arrangements with more than one lender, although that is less common at the present time, given that there are fewer lenders. In connection with a dealer’s floor plan financing arrangements with a qualified lending institution, Marine Products or its subsidiaries have agreed to repurchase inventory which the lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to Marine Products in a “new and unused” condition subject to normal wear and tear, as defined. The contractual agreements that Marine Products or its subsidiaries have with these qualified lenders contain the Company’s assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on repossessed boats, up to certain contractually determined dollar limits negotiated with the lender.
 
The Company currently has an agreement with one of the floor plan lenders whereby the contractual repurchase amount is limited to a maximum of 16 percent of the average net receivables financed by the floor plan lender for dealers during the prior 12 month period, which was $15.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation of approximately $5.7 million, with various expiration and cancellation terms of less than one year. Accordingly, the aggregate repurchase obligation with all financing institutions was approximately $20.7 million as of December 31, 2018. In the event that a dealer defaults on a credit line, the qualified lender may then invoke the manufacturers’ repurchase obligation with respect to that dealer. In that event, all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted. Unlike Marine Products’ obligation to repurchase boats repossessed by qualified lenders, Marine Products is under no obligation to repurchase boats directly from dealers. Marine Products does not sponsor financing programs to the retail consumer; any consumer financing promotions for a prospective boat purchaser would be the responsibility of the dealer.
 
Marine Products’ dealer sales incentive programs are generally designed to promote early replenishment of the stock in dealer inventories depleted throughout the prime spring and summer selling seasons, and to promote the sales of older models in dealer inventory and particular models during specified periods. These programs help to stabilize Marine Products’ manufacturing between the peak and off-peak periods, and promote sales of certain models. For the 2019 model year (which commenced July 1, 2018), Marine Products offered its dealers several sales incentive programs based on dollar volumes and timing of dealer purchases. Program incentives offered include sales discounts, retail sales incentives and payment of floor plan financing interest charged by qualified floor plan lenders to dealers generally through April 30, 2019. After the interest payment programs end, interest costs revert to the dealer at rates set by the lender. A dealer makes periodic curtailment payments (principal payments) on outstanding obligations against its dealer inventory as set forth in the floor plan financing agreements between the dealer and its particular lender.
 
We believe that dealer inventories of our boat models as of December 31, 2018 are appropriate relative to the current level of retail customer demand; approximately 91 percent of boats have been in dealer inventory less than 18 months, as of December 31, 2018, approximately the same as the previous year. The sales order backlog as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 1,953 boats with estimated net sales of approximately $94.4 million. This represents an approximate 19.0 week backlog based on recent production levels. As of December 31, 2017, the sales order backlog was approximately 1,722 boats with estimated net sales of $72.9 million, representing an approximate 14.4 week backlog. The Company will continue to monitor the number of boats in dealer inventories and adjust its production levels as it deems necessary to manage dealer inventory levels. The Company typically does not manufacture a significant number of boats for its own inventory. The Company occasionally manufactures boats for its own inventory because the number of boats required for immediate shipment is not always the most efficient number of boats to produce in a given production schedule.
 
Research and Development
 
Essentially the same technologies and processes are used to produce fiberglass boats by all boat manufacturers. The most common method to build fiberglass boats is with open-face molding. This is usually a labor-intensive, manual process whereby employees hand spray and apply fiberglass and resin in layers on open molds to create boat hulls, decks and other smaller fiberglass components. A single open-face mold is typically capable of producing approximately three hulls per week.
 
Marine Products has been a leading innovator in the recreational boating industry. One of the Company’s most innovative designs is the full-length “Extended V-Plane” running surface on its Chaparral boat models. Typically, sterndrive boats have a several foot gap on the bottom rear of the hull where the engine enters the water. With the Extended V-Plane, the running surface extends the full length to the rear of the boat. The benefit of this innovation is more deck space, better planing performance and a more comfortable ride. Although the basic hull designs are similar, the Company has historically introduced a variety of new models each year and periodically replaces, updates or discontinues existing models.

Another hull design is the Hydro LiftTM used on the Robalo boat models. This variable dead rise hull design provides a smooth ride in rough water conditions. It increases the maximum speed obtainable by a given engine horsepower and weight of the boat. Robalo’s current models utilize the Hydro LiftTM design and we plan to continue to provide this design on Robalo models.
 
A bow design known as the Wide TechTM was first used on the Chaparral Sunesta Wide TechTM and Xtreme models for the 2008 model year, and is currently being used on Chaparral’s SSi Wide TechTM Sportboats, Sunesta Sportdecks, and two Signature Cruisers. The Wide TechTM bow design allows the models to have the Extended V-Plane hull, with the features and benefits that this hull design offers. In addition, the Wide TechTM bow design provides a larger seating area, as well as additional storage space, in the front of the boat. Furthermore, it allows the models to have a non-skid walkway on the bow, which makes entering and leaving the boat easier than in other boat models. This bow design may be incorporated on other Chaparral boat models in subsequent model years.
 
In support of its new product development efforts, Marine Products incurred research and development costs of $822 thousand in 2018, $960 thousand in 2017, and $858 thousand in 2016.
 
Industry Overview
 
The recreational marine market in the United States is a mature market, with 2017 (latest data available to us) retail expenditures of approximately $39 billion spent on new and used boats, motors and engines, trailers, accessories and other associated costs as estimated by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (“NMMA”). Pleasure boats compete with all other leisure activities for consumers’ limited free time.
 
There are currently approximately 16 million boats owned in the United States, including outboard, inboard, sterndrive, jet drive, sailboats and personal watercraft. Marine Products competes in the sterndrive boating category with five lines of Chaparral boats, in the jet drive category with its Chaparral Vortex jet boats and in the outboard category with its Robalo sport fishing boats, Chaparral SunCoast deck boats and a new Chaparral H2O outboard model. Approximately 38 percent of the Company’s unit sales in 2018 were sterndrive boats compared to 39 percent in 2017.
 
Industry sales of new sterndrive boats in the United States during 2018 totaled 10,267 (source: Info-Link Technologies, Inc.) and accounted for approximately 14 percent of the total new fiberglass powerboats sold between 19 and 34 feet in hull length. Sales of new sterndrive boats had an estimated total retail value of $849 million, or an average retail price per boat of approximately $74,000. Management believes that the five largest states for boat sales at the present time are Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, California and Wisconsin. Marine Products has dealers in each of these states.
 
The U.S. domestic recreational boating industry includes sales in the segments of new and used boats, motors and engines, trailers, and other boat accessories. The new fiberglass boat market segment with hull lengths of 19 to 34 feet, the primary market segment in which Marine Products competes, represented $5.1 billion in retail sales during 2018. The table below reflects the estimated annual sales within this segment by category for 2018 and 2017 (source: Info-Link Technologies, Inc.):
 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
-----------------+-------+--------+-------------+--
 | Boats | | Sales ($ B) | | | Boats | Sales ($ B)
Sterndrive Boats | | 10,267 | | $ | 0.9 | | 10,847 | $ | 0.9
Outboard Boats | | 51,419 | | | 2.9 | | 49,041 | | 2.5
Inboard Boats | | 10,831 | | | 1.2 | | 9,887 | | 1.0
Jet Boats | | 3,200 | | | 0.1 | | 2,819 | | 0.1
TOTAL | | 75,717 | | $ | 5.1 | | 72,594 | $ | 4.5



Chaparral’s products are categorized as sterndrive boats, jet boats and outboard boats and Robalo’s products are categorized as outboard boats. Although industry-wide sterndrive boat unit sales have been declining, the rate of decline in recent years has slowed. The Company first introduced jet boat models in 2015 and has been pleased with the reception by of our models by dealers and customers. Based on available market share data, Chaparral’s share of the jet boat market during the latest reported period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately 9.7 percent.
 
The recreational boat manufacturing market remains highly fragmented with the exception of Brunswick Corporation, which has acquired and currently operates a number of recreational boat brands. We estimate that the boat manufacturing industry includes fewer than 20 sterndrive manufacturers and approximately 75 outboard boat manufacturers with significant unit production, with the majority representing small, privately held companies with varying degrees of professional management and manufacturing skill. According to estimates provided by Statistical Surveys, Inc., during the latest reported period ended September 30, 2018 (latest information available), the top five sterndrive manufacturers, which includes Chaparral, have a combined market share of approximately 61 percent; compared to 59 percent in the same period one year ago. Chaparral’s market share in sterndrive units during this period was approximately 16.1 percent, which represents a decrease of approximately 0.7 percentage points compared to 16.8 percent during the period ended September 30, 2017. The Company believes that its market share is primarily due to the success of our value priced Chaparral H20 models, our larger SSX models and the Surf Series.

Several factors influence sales trends in the recreational boating industry, including general economic growth, consumer confidence, household incomes, the availability and cost of financing for our dealers and customers, weather, fuel prices, tax laws, demographics and consumers’ leisure time. Also, the value of residential and vacation real estate in coastal and recreational areas influences recreational boat sales. The most recent NMMA surveys indicate that many past boating participants do not currently participate in boating because of high costs and a lack of leisure time. The increases in the cost of certain components, international tariffs, operating costs, and the impact of environmental regulation have increased the cost of boats and boat ownership in recent years, and these trends may continue. Competition from other leisure and recreational activities for available leisure time can also affect sales of recreational boats.
 
Management believes Marine Products is well positioned to take advantage of the following conditions, which continue to characterize the industry:
 

· | labor-intensive manufacturing processes that remain largely unautomated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increasingly strict environmental standards derived from governmental regulations and customer sensitivities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a lack of focus on coordinated customer service and support by dealers and manufacturers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a lack of financial strength among retail boat dealers and many manufacturers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a high degree of fragmentation and competition among the large number of sterndrive and outboard recreational boat manufacturers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Strategies
 
Recreational boating is a mature industry. According to Info-Link Technologies, Inc., sales of new boats of all types increased at a compounded annual rate of approximately 6.9 percent between 2014 and 2018. During this period, Marine Products experienced a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.2 percent in the number of boats sold. The Company has historically grown its boat sales and net sales primarily through increasing market share and by expanding its number of models and product lines. During 2018 the Company’s strategy was to support our dealers’ need to maintain a higher level of inventories than in previous years, given relatively stable retail demand and an improved dealer financing environment. At the end of 2018, the Company’s dealer inventories were approximately 1.0 percent higher than they were at the end of 2017, and our unit order backlog was 31.9 percent higher than it was at the end of 2017. We believe that inventories and the current unit order backlog are appropriate relative to expected retail demand during the 2019 retail selling season. Chaparral has grown its sterndrive market share in the 19 to 34 feet length category from 5.9 percent in fiscal 1996 to 16.1 percent during the latest reported period ended September 30, 2018 (the most recent information available to us from Statistical Surveys, Inc.).
 
During 2018, we continued to emphasize the Surf Series line of Chaparral models, our larger Chaparral SSX models, and our larger Robalo models. We believe that these boat models will expand our customer base, and leverage our strong dealer network and reputation for quality and styling. These models were partially responsible for increases in our net sales, gross profit, operating profit, and net income.
 
These models align with Marine Products’ overall operating strategy, which emphasizes innovative designs and manufacturing processes, and the production of a high quality product, while also seeking to lower manufacturing costs through increased efficiencies in our facilities. In the current environment, this strategy also includes the production of lower-priced, entry level models which appeal to a value-conscious consumer who wants an updated, high quality product. In addition, we seek opportunities to leverage our buying power through economies of scale. Management believes its membership in the ABA positions Marine Products as a significant third-party customer of major suppliers of sterndrive engines. Marine Products’ Chaparral subsidiary is a founding member of the ABA, which collectively represents 14 independent boat manufacturers that have formed a buying group to pool their purchasing power in order to achieve improved pricing on engines, fiberglass, resin and many other components. Marine Products intends to continue seeking the most advantageous purchasing arrangements from its suppliers.
 
Our marketing strategy seeks to increase market share by enabling Marine Products to expand its presence by building dedicated sales, marketing and distribution systems. Marine Products has a distribution network of 254 independent dealers located throughout the United States and in several international markets. Our strategy is to increase selectively the quantity of our dealers, and to improve the quality and effectiveness of our entire dealer network. Marine Products seeks to capitalize on its strong dealer network by educating its dealers on the sales and servicing of our products and helping them provide more comprehensive customer service, with the goal of increasing customer satisfaction, customer retention and future sales. Marine Products provides promotional and incentive programs to help its dealers increase product sales and customer satisfaction. During 2018 we continued to expand our nationally advertised fixed retail pricing to include more of our models. We believe the nationally advertised fixed retail pricing gives the consumer confidence that that they are getting the best possible price resulting in higher customer satisfaction, and also encourages consistent pricing across our dealer network. Marine Products also realizes that innovative marketing is an increasingly important component of the full customer experience, and is leading the way with marketing and branding that consistently present a luxury-oriented message and integrate themselves into the boater’s entire experience.

A component of Marine Products’ overall strategy is to consider making strategic acquisitions in order to complement existing product lines, expand its geographic presence in the marketplace and strengthen its capabilities depending upon availability, price and complementary product lines. We constantly review potential acquisition targets and intend to continue doing so in the future.
 
Competition
 
The recreational boat industry is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers, dealers and boat show exhibition space. There is significant competition both within markets we currently serve and in new markets that we may enter. Marine Products’ brands compete with several large national or regional manufacturers that have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. However, we believe that our corporate infrastructure and marketing and sales capabilities, in addition to our financial strength, and our nationwide presence, enable us to compete effectively against these companies. In each of our markets, Marine Products competes on the basis of responsiveness to customer needs, the quality and range of models offered, and the competitive pricing of those models. Additionally, Marine Products faces general competition from all other recreational businesses seeking to attract consumers’ leisure time and discretionary spending dollars.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Certain materials used in boat manufacturing, including the resins used to make the decks and hulls, are toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state pollution control agencies, which require reports and inspect facilities to monitor compliance with their regulations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards limit the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Marine Products’ manufacturing facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. Marine Products believes that its facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. Although capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws are expected to increase during the coming years, we do not currently anticipate that any material expenditure will be required to continue to comply with existing environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities.

Recreational powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. All boats sold by Marine Products meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971. The Boat Safety Act requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. Marine Products has from time to time instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by other manufacturers. None of the recalls has had a material adverse effect on Marine Products.
 
The EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet an air emission standard that requires fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. These regulations also require, among other things, that the engine manufacturer provide a warranty that the engine meets EPA emission standards. The engines used in Marine Products’ Chaparral and Robalo product lines are subject to these regulations. These regulations are similar to regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board in 2007, but apply to all U.S. states and territories. This regulation has increased the cost to manufacture the majority of the Company’s boat products. The additional cost of complying with these EPA regulations may reduce Marine Products’ profitability, because the Company may have to absorb the increased cost. It may also reduce Marine Products’ net sales, because the increased cost of owning a boat may force consumers to buy a smaller or less expensive boat or forego a boat purchase, and because increased product cost will reduce the amount of inventory that Marine Products’ dealers can carry, thus reducing retail consumers’ choices.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, Marine Products had approximately 976 employees (an increase from approximately 891 at December 31, 2017), of whom four were management, 63 were administrative and six were sales.
 
None of Marine Products’ employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement. Marine Products’ entire workforce is currently employed in the United States and Marine Products believes that its relations with its employees are good.
Proprietary Matters
 
Marine Products owns a number of trademarks, trade names and patents that it believes are important to its business. Except for the Chaparral and Robalo trademarks, however, Marine Products is not dependent upon any single trademark or trade name or group of trademarks or trade names. The Chaparral and Robalo trademarks are currently registered in the United States. The current duration for such registration ranges from seven to 15 years but each registration may be renewed an unlimited number of times.
 
Several of Chaparral’s and Robalo’s designs are protected under the U.S. Copyright Office’s Vessel Hull Design Protection Act. This law grants an owner of an original vessel hull design certain exclusive rights. Protection is offered for hull designs that are made available to the public for purchase provided that the application is made within two years. As of December 31, 2018, there were 22 Chaparral hull designs and four Robalo hull designs registered under the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act.
 
During 2008 Chaparral was granted a design patent on its Wide TechTM hull design by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patent has a term of 14 years and protects the Wide TechTM hull currently used on the Sunesta Wide TechTM and Xtreme, SSi Wide TechTM and two of its Signature Cruisers from being used by other pleasure boat manufacturers. Marine Products believes that this patent is important to its business.
 
Seasonality
 
Marine Products’ quarterly operating results are affected by weather and general economic conditions. Quarterly operating results for the second quarter have historically recorded the highest sales volume for the year because this corresponds with the highest retail sales volume period. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period.
Inflation
 
The market prices of certain materials used in manufacturing the Company’s products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper and steel, have at certain periods been volatile. During 2018, the costs of several of these raw materials have increased slightly. In addition, the cost of certain components used in the manufacturing of the Company’s products has increased due to high demand and limited supplier capacity. As a result, it is possible the Company will incur higher materials purchase costs in 2019. These higher prices of materials would increase the costs of manufacturing the Company’s products, and could negatively affect our profit margins, due to the competitive nature of the selling environment for recreational boats. Furthermore, the costs of these raw materials remain volatile, and may decrease in the future.

New boat buyers typically finance their purchases. Higher inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. During 2018, there were indications that inflation in the general economy was beginning to increase, and general market interest rates have increased as well. If these trends continue during 2019, prospective buyers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event that interest rates rise or credit is not available to finance their boat purchases.
