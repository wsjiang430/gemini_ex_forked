Item 1.    Business
Overview
Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. is a leading physician-centric, technology-powered, risk-bearing healthcare company. Leveraging its proprietary end-to-end technology solutions, ApolloMed operates an integrated healthcare delivery platform that enables providers to successfully participate in value-based care arrangements, thus empowering them to deliver high-quality care to patients in a cost-effective manner. We, together with our affiliated physician groups and consolidated entities, provide coordinated outcomes-based medical care primarily serving patients in California, the majority of whom are covered by private or public insurance provided through Medicare, Medicaid, and health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), with a small portion of our revenue coming from non-insured patients. We provide care coordination services to each major constituent of the healthcare delivery system, including patients, families, primary care physicians, specialists, acute care hospitals, alternative sites of inpatient care, physician groups, and health plans. Our physician network consists of primary care physicians, specialist physicians, physician and specialist extenders, and hospitalists. We operate primarily through ApolloMed and the following subsidiaries: Network Medical Management, Inc. (“NMM”), Apollo Medical Management, Inc. (“AMM”), and APAACO, and their consolidated entities, including consolidated VIEs. 
Led by a management team with several decades of experience, we have built a company and culture that is focused on physicians providing high-quality medical care, population health management, and care coordination for patients. As a result, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the shift in the U.S. healthcare industry toward providing value-based and results-oriented healthcare with a focus on patient satisfaction, high-quality care, and cost efficiency.
In December 2017, ApolloMed merged with NMM, a California corporation formed in 1994 (the “2017 Merger”). As a result of the 2017 Merger, NMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of ApolloMed. The combined company operates under the Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. name, but NMM is the larger entity in terms of assets, revenues, and earnings. In addition, as of the closing of the 2017 Merger, the majority of the board of directors of the combined company was comprised of former NMM directors and directors nominated for election by NMM. Accordingly, ApolloMed is considered to be the legal acquirer (and accounting acquiree), whereas NMM is considered to be the accounting acquirer (and legal acquiree).
We implement and operate different innovative healthcare models, primarily including the following integrated operations:
•Independent practice associations (“IPAs”), which contract with physicians and provide care to Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial and dual-eligible patients on a risk- and value-based fee basis;
•Management service organizations (“MSOs”), which provide management, administrative and other support services to our affiliated physician groups such as IPAs;
•APAACO, which participates in the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model (“GPDC Model”) model sponsored by CMS, and focuses on providing high-quality and cost-efficient care to Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) patients;
•Outpatient clinics providing primary care, specialty care, urgent care, as well as an ambulatory surgery center and specialty clinics, including cardiac care and diagnostic testing services; and
•Hospitalists, which include our contracted physicians who focus on the delivery of comprehensive medical care to hospitalized patients.
We operate under one reportable segment, the healthcare delivery segment. Our revenue streams are diversified among our various operations and contract types, and include:
•Capitation payments, including payments made by CMS from the GPDC Model;
•Risk pool settlements and incentives;
•Management fees, including stipends from hospitals and percentages of collections; and
•FFS reimbursements.
ApolloMed’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol “AMEH.”
Organization
Subsidiaries
We operate through our subsidiaries, including:
•NMM;
•AMM; and
•APAACO.
Each of NMM and AMM operates as a management services organization (“MSO”) and is in the business of providing management services to physician practice corporations under long-term management and/or administrative services agreements (“MSAs”), pursuant to which the MSO manages certain non-medical services for the physician groups and have exclusive authority over all non-medical decision-making related to ongoing business operations. The MSAs generally provide for management fees that are recognized as earned based on a percentage of revenue or cash collections generated by the physician practices.
With the termination of the NGACO Model on December 31, 2021, APAACO participated as a Direct Contracting Entity (“DCE”) under the GPDC Model for Performance Year (“PY”) 2022, or PY2022. Under the GPDC Model, CMS contracts with DCEs, which are composed of healthcare providers operating under a common legal structure, and accepts financial accountability for the overall quality and cost of medical care furnished to Medicare FFS beneficiaries aligned to the entity. The combination of the FFS model and the GPDC model changes the distribution of responsibilities, risks, costs, and rewards among CMS, DCEs, and providers. Under the GPDC Model, a DCE voluntarily takes on operational, financial, and legal responsibilities and risks that no party has, individually or collectively, under the existing FFS model. Each DCE bears the economic costs, and reaps the economic rewards, of fulfilling its responsibilities and managing its risks as a DCE. CMS has redesigned and renamed the GPDC Model to the ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health Model (“ACO REACH Model”). The ACO REACH Model commenced on January 1, 2023. 
Through our accountable care organization (“ACO”) and network of IPAs with more than approximately 11,000 contracted healthcare providers, which have agreements with various health plans, hospitals, and other HMOs, we are responsible for coordinating the care of approximately 1.3 million patients, as of December 31, 2022. These patients are comprised of managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employers, or who have acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for Medicaid or Medicare benefits. Our managed patients benefit from an integrated approach that places physicians at the center of patient care and utilizes sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high-quality, cost-effective care. To implement a patient-centered, physician-centric experience, we also have other integrated and synergistic operations, including (i) MSOs that provide management and other services to our affiliated IPAs, (ii) outpatient clinics, and (iii) hospitalists that coordinate the care of patients in hospitals.
Variable Interest Entities
If an entity is determined to be a VIE, we evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis is a qualitative analysis based on power and benefits. We consolidate a VIE if we have both power and benefits – that is, (i) we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly influence the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) we have the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 18 – “Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)” to our consolidated financial statements for information on our entities that qualify as consolidated VIEs. 
Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners from practicing medicine, which are generally referred to as the corporate practice of medicine laws. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws require that only physicians can practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions, or engage in certain arrangements with other physicians, such as fee-splitting. California is a corporate practice of medicine state.
Therefore, in addition to our subsidiaries, we mainly operate by maintaining long-term MSAs with our affiliated IPAs, which are owned and operated by a network of independent primary care physicians and specialists, and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide medical services. Under such agreements, we provide and perform non-medical management and administrative services, including financial management, information systems, marketing, risk management, and administrative support.
NMM has entered into MSAs with several affiliated IPAs, including Allied Physicians of California IPA d.b.a. Allied Pacific of California IPA (“APC”). APC contracts with various HMOs or licensed healthcare service plans, each of which pays a fixed payment (“capitation”). In return, APC arranges for the delivery of healthcare services by contracting with physicians or professional medical corporations for primary care and specialty care services. APC assumes the financial risk of the cost of delivering healthcare services in excess of the fixed amounts received. The risk is subject to stop-loss provisions in contracts with HMOs. Some risk is transferred to the contracted physicians or professional corporations. The physicians in the IPA are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for enrolled patients. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, APC has been determined to be a VIE of NMM, as NMM is its primary beneficiary with the ability, through majority representation on the APC Joint Planning Board and otherwise, to direct the activities (excluding clinical decisions) that most significantly affect APC’s economic performance. Therefore, APC and its consolidated subsidiaries, Universal Care Acquisition Partners, LLC (“UCAP”), Medical Property Partners, LLC (“MPP”), AMG Properties, LLC (“AMG Properties”), and ZLL Partners, LLC (“ZLL”), AHMC International Cancer Center, a Medical Corporation (“ICC”), 120 Hellman LLC (“120 Hellman”), APC’s consolidated VIEs, Concourse Diagnostic Surgery Center, LLC (“CDSC”), APC-LSMA Designated Shareholder Medical Corporation (“APC-LSMA”), Tag-8 Medical Investment Group, LLC (“Tag 8”), and Tag-6 Medical Investment Group, LLC (“Tag 6”), and APC-LSMA’s consolidated subsidiaries, Alpha Care Medical Group, Inc. (“Alpha Care”), Accountable Health Care IPA, a Professional Medical Corporation (“Accountable Health Care”), and AMG, a Professional Medical Corporation (“AMG”) are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.
CDSC is an ambulatory surgery center in City of Industry, California. The facility is Medicare-certified and accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare. CDSC is consolidated as a VIE by APC, as it was determined that APC has a controlling financial interest in CDSC and is the primary beneficiary of CDSC. 
Due to laws prohibiting a California professional corporation that has more than one shareholder, such as APC, from being a shareholder in another California professional corporation, APC cannot directly own shares in other professional corporations in which APC has invested. However, an exception to this regulation permits a professional corporation that has only one shareholder to own shares in another professional corporation. In reliance on this exception, APC-LSMA holds controlling and non-controlling ownership interests in several medical corporations. APC-LSMA was formed in October 2012 as a designated shareholder professional corporation. Dr. Thomas Lam, a shareholder and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of APC and the Co-Chief Executive Officer of ApolloMed, is a nominee shareholder of APC-LSMA. APC makes all investment decisions on behalf of APC-LSMA, funds all investments, and receives all distributions from the investments. APC has the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from all investments made by APC-LSMA. APC-LSMA’s sole function is to act as the nominee shareholder for APC in other California medical professional corporations. Therefore, APC-LSMA, and its consolidated subsidiaries, Alpha Care, Accountable Health Care, and AMG are controlled and consolidated by APC as the primary beneficiary.
Through AMM, we manage a number of our affiliates pursuant to their long-term MSAs, including: ApolloMed Hospitalists (“AMH”), a physician group that provides hospitalist, intensivist, and physician advisor services, and Southern California Heart Centers (“SCHC”), a specialty clinic that focuses on cardiac care and diagnostic testing. AMH and SCHC are VIEs of AMM. We have determined that AMM is the primary beneficiary of such entities. 
AP-AMH Medical Corporation (“AP-AMH”) and AP-AMH 2 Medical Corporation (“AP-AMH 2”) were formed in May 2019 and July 2021, respectively, as designated shareholder professional corporations. Dr. Thomas Lam is the sole shareholder of AP-AMH and AP-AMH 2. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, AP-AMH and AP-AMH 2 are determined to be VIEs of ApolloMed. Therefore, AP-AMH, AP-AMH 2, and AP-AMH 2’s consolidated subsidiaries, Access Primary Care Medical Group (“APCMG”), Jade Health Care Medical Group, Inc. (“Jade”), and All American Medical Group (“AAMG”) are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.
Sun Clinical Labs (“Sun Labs”) is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified full-service lab that operates across the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California. In August 2021, Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. acquired 49% of the aggregate issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun Labs for an aggregate purchase price of $4.0 million. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, Sun Labs is determined to be a VIE of the Company and is consolidated by the Company.
Diagnostic Medical Group of Southern California (“DMG”) is a professional medical California corporation and a complete outpatient imaging center. APC owns 40% of DMG and is managed by a subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, DMG is determined to be a VIE of the Company and is consolidated by the Company. 
On October 14, 2022, a sole equity holder acquired 100% of the equity interest in Valley Oaks Medical Group (“VOMG”). Under the terms of the Physician Equity Holder Agreement (the “Equity Agreement”) between ApolloMed and the equity holder, ApolloMed may designate a third party who is permitted under Nevada law to be an owner or equity holder of VOMG with the right (the “Acquisition Right”) (a) to acquire the equity holder’s equity interest or (b) to acquire from VOMG. The Acquisition Right shall be exercisable by ApolloMed and equity holder shall be obligated to assign and transfer the equity interest or to cause VOMG to issue new equity interests (as applicable) to ApolloMed. As a result of the arrangement and in accordance with relevant accounting guidance, VOMG is determined to be a VIE of ApolloMed and is consolidated by the Company.
As of December 31, 2022, ApolloMed and its subsidiaries’ consolidated VIEs, and their consolidated subsidiaries, included the following entities: (i) ApolloMed’s consolidated VIEs, AP-AMH, AP-AMH 2, Sun Labs, DMG, AMH, SCHC, APC, and VOMG; (ii) AP-AMH 2’s consolidated subsidiary, APCMG, Jade, and AAMG; (iii) APC’s subsidiaries, UCAP, MPP, AMG Properties, ZLL, ICC, 120 Hellman, APC’s consolidated VIEs, CDSC, APC-LSMA, Tag 8, and Tag 6; and (iv) APC-LSMA’s consolidated subsidiaries Alpha Care, Accountable Health Care, and AMG.
Investments
We invested in several entities in the healthcare and real estate industries. APC holds a 50% interest in each of the following real estate entities: 531 W. College LLC, and One MSO LLC (“One MSO”). ApolloMed holds a 30% interest in CAIPA MSO, LLC (“CAIPA MSO”). CAIPA MSO is a New York-based management services organization affiliated with Chinese-American IPA d.b.a. Coalition of Asian-American IPA (“CAIPA”), a leading independent practice association serving the greater New York City area. APC-LSMA holds a 25% interest in the IPA line of business of LaSalle Medical Associates (“LMA”) and a 40% interest in Pacific Medical Imaging and Oncology Center, Inc. (“PMIOC”). PMIOC provides comprehensive diagnostic imaging services using state-of-the-art technology. PMIOC offers high-quality diagnostic services, such as MRI/MRA, PET/CT, CT, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, digital x-rays, bone densitometry, and digital mammography, at its facilities. These investments are accounted for under the equity method as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control over operations.
APC holds a 2.8% membership interests of MediPortal LLC, a New York limited liability company, and NMM holds a 10% interest in AchievaMed, Inc., a California corporation. The Company also holds equity securities that are primarily comprised of common stock of a payor partner that completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) in June 2021 and Nutex Health Inc. (formerly known as Clinigence Holdings, Inc.) (“Nutex”). As of December 31, 2022, the value of the equity securities was $5.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, APC also holds a 18.12% ownership interest in ApolloMed. APC’s ownership interest in ApolloMed is eliminated upon consolidation. 
Our Industry
Industry Overview
U.S. healthcare spending has increased steadily over the past approximately two decades. CMS estimates that total U.S. healthcare expenditures are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.1% from 2021 to 2030 and will reach $6.8 trillion by 2030. Health spending is projected to grow 1.8% faster than the U.S. gross domestic product per year on average over 2021-2030, and as a result, the healthcare share of gross domestic product is expected to stay consistent from 19.7% in 2020 to 19.6% in 2030. Medicare spending increased by 8.4% to $900.8 billion and Medicaid spending increased by 9.2% to $734.0 billion in 2021, which accounted for 21% and 17% of total health expenditures, respectively. Private health insurance spending increased by 5.8% to $1.2 trillion in 2021, accounting for 28% of total health expenditures. Medicare spending is expected to have the fastest growth (7.3% per year for 2021-2030) primarily due to the projected enrollment growth. 
Managed care health plans were developed in the U.S., primarily during the 1980s, in an attempt to mitigate the rising cost of providing healthcare to populations covered by health insurance. These managed care health plans enroll members through their employers in connection with federal Medicare benefits or state Medicaid programs. As a result of the prevalence of these health plans, many seniors now becoming eligible for Medicare have been interacting with managed care companies through their employers for the last 30 years. Individuals now turning 65 are likely more familiar with the managed care setting than previous Medicare populations. The healthcare industry, however, is highly regulated by various government agencies and heavily relies on reimbursement and payments from government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Companies in the healthcare industry therefore have to organize, operate around, and face challenges from idiosyncratic laws and regulations.
Many health plans recognize both the opportunity for growth from adding members, as well as the potential risks and costs associated with managing additional members. In California, many health plans subcontract a significant portion of the responsibility for managing patient care to integrated medical systems such as ApolloMed and our affiliated physician groups. These integrated healthcare systems offer a comprehensive medical delivery system, sophisticated care management know-how, and infrastructure to more efficiently provide for the healthcare needs of the population enrolled with that health plan. While reimbursement models for these arrangements vary around the U.S., health plans often prospectively pay the integrated healthcare system a fixed capitation payment, which is frequently based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments to integrated healthcare systems, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which the system manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that system. To the extent that these systems manage such expenses under the capitated levels, the system realizes an operating profit. On the other hand, if the expenses exceed projected levels, the system will realize an operating deficit. Since premiums paid represent a substantial amount per person, there is a significant revenue opportunity for an integrated medical system that is able to effectively manage healthcare costs for the capitated arrangements entered into by its affiliated physician groups.
Industry Trends and Demand Drivers
We believe that the healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation and the demand for our offerings is driven by the confluence of a number of fundamental healthcare industry trends, including:
Shift to Value-Based and Results-Oriented Models. According to the 2021 National Health Expenditure Historical Data prepared by CMS, healthcare spending in the U.S. increased 2.7% to $4.3 trillion in 2021, representing 18.3% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product. CMS projects healthcare spending in the U.S. to increase at an average rate of 5.1% for 2021-2030 and to reach approximately $6.8 trillion by 2030. To address this expected significant rise in healthcare costs, the U.S. healthcare market is seeking more efficient and effective methods of delivering care. The fee-for-service reimbursement model has arguably played a major role in increasing the level and growth rate of healthcare spending. In response, both the public and private sectors are shifting away from the fee-for-service reimbursement model toward value-based, capitated payment models that are designed to incentivize value and quality at an individual patient level. The number of Americans covered by capitated payment programs continues to increase, which drives more coordinated and outcomes-based patient care.
Increasingly Patient-Centered. More patients are becoming actively involved and taking an informed role in how their own healthcare is delivered resulting in the healthcare marketplace becoming increasingly patient-centered, and thus requiring providers to deliver team-based, coordinated, and accessible care to stay competitive.
Added Complexity. In the healthcare space, more sophisticated technology has been employed, new diagnostics and treatments have been introduced, research and development has expanded, and regulations have multiplied. This expanding complexity drives a growing and continuous need for integrated care delivery systems.
Integration of Healthcare Information. Across the healthcare landscape, a significant amount of data is being created every day, driven by patient care, payment systems, regulatory compliance, and record keeping. As the amount of healthcare data continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to connect disparate data and apply insights in a targeted manner in order to better achieve the goals of higher quality and more efficient care.
Integrated Medical Systems
Integrated medical systems that are able to pool a large number of patients, such as the Company and its affiliated physician groups, are positioned to take advantage of industry trends, meet patient and government demands, and benefit from cost advantages resulting from their scale of operation and integrated approach of care delivery. In addition, integrated medical systems with years of managed care experience can leverage their expertise and sizeable medical data to identify specific treatment strategies and interventions, improve the quality of medical care and lower cost. Many integrated medical systems have also established physician performance metrics that allow them to monitor quality and service outcomes achieved by participating physicians in order to reward efficient, high-quality care delivered to members and initiate improvement efforts for physicians whose performance can be enhanced.
IPAs and MSOs
    An IPA is an association of independent physicians, or other organization that contracts with independent physicians, and provides services to HMOs, which are medical insurance groups that provide health services generally for a fixed annual fee, on a negotiated per capita rate, flat retainer fee, or negotiated FFS basis. MSOs are formed to provide management and administrative support services to affiliated physician groups such as IPAs. These services include physician recruiting, physician and health plan contracting, care management, provider relations, member services, revenue cycle management, and claims processing.
ACOs
An ACO participates in in one or more payment and delivery models sponsored by CMS that provides high-quality and affordable care to Medicare fee-for-service patients.
Outpatient Clinics
Ambulatory surgery centers and other outpatient clinics are healthcare facilities that specialize in performing outpatient surgeries, ambulatory treatments, and diagnostic and other services in local communities. As medical care has increasingly been delivered in clinic settings, many integrated medical systems also operate healthcare facilities primarily focused on the diagnosis and/or care of outpatients, including those with chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, to cover the primary healthcare needs of local communities.
Hospitalists
Hospitalists are doctors specialized in the care of patients in the hospital. Hospitalists assume the inpatient care responsibilities otherwise provided by primary care or other attending physicians and are reimbursed through the same billing procedures as other physicians. Hospitalists tend to focus exclusively on inpatient care. By practicing in the same facilities, hospitalists perform consistent functions, interact regularly with the same healthcare professionals, and thus are familiar with specific and unique hospital processes, which can result in greater efficiency, less process variability, and better outcomes. Through managing the treatment of a large number of patients with similar clinical needs, hospitalists generally develop practice expertise in both the diagnosis and treatment of common conditions that require hospitalization. For these reasons, hospitalists have an increasingly important role in improving care quality. 
Population Health Management
Population health management (“PHM”) is a central trend within healthcare delivery, which includes the aggregation of patient data across multiple health information technology resources, the analysis of that data into a single, actionable patient record, and the actions through which care providers can improve both clinical and financial outcomes. PHM seeks to improve the health outcomes by monitoring and identifying individual patients, aggregating data, and providing a comprehensive clinical picture of each patient. Using that data, providers can track, and hopefully improve, clinical outcomes while lowering costs. A successful PHM platform requires a robust care and risk management infrastructure, a cohesive delivery system, and a well-managed partnership network.
Our Business Operations
IPAs
Each of our affiliated IPAs comprises a network of independent primary care physicians and specialists who collectively care for patients and contract with HMOs to provide physician services to their enrollees typically under capitated arrangements. Under the capitated model, an HMO pays the IPA a capitation payment and assigns it the responsibility for providing physician services required by patients. The IPA physicians are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for enrolled patients. Most of the HMO agreements have an initial term of two years renewing automatically for successive one-year terms. The HMO agreements generally allow either party to terminate the HMO agreements without cause typically with a four to six months advance notice and provide for a termination for cause by the HMO at any time.
MSOs
Our MSOs generally provide services to our affiliated IPAs or ACOs under long-term MSAs, pursuant to which they manage certain non-medical services for the physician groups and have exclusive authority over all non-medical decision-making related to ongoing business operations. These services include but are not limited to:
•Physician recruiting;
•Physician and health plan contracting;
•Care management, including utilization management, medical management, and quality management;
•Provider relations;
•Member services, including annual wellness evaluations;
•Pre-negotiating contracts with specialists, labs, imaging centers, nursing homes, and other vendors; and
•Revenue cycle management.
ACO REACH (previous iteration: GPDC Model)
In February 2022, CMS announced that APAACO was approved to participate in the GPDC Model and APAACO began operations under this new model in 2022. Under the current Administration, changes were made to the model, and it was renamed the ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health Model. The ACO REACH Model commenced on January 1, 2023. We had devoted significant effort and resources, financial and otherwise, to the GPDC Model in PY2022, and have now transitioned to the ACO REACH Model in PY2023. APAACO’s new Participation Agreement for the ACO REACH Model runs through PY2026. The Company continues to be eligible to receive any shared savings or deficit under the GPDC Model for PY2022. The Company will be eligible to receive any shared savings or deficit under the ACO REACH Model for Performance Years 2023-2026. 
In advance of its participation in the ACO REACH Model, APAACO entered into agreements with approximately 850 medical care providers, including physicians, hospitals, nursing facilities and multiple labs, radiology centers, outpatient surgery centers, dialysis clinics, and other service providers.
Under the Participation Agreement, APAACO must require its Participant and Preferred Providers to make medically necessary covered services available to beneficiaries in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance. During each Performance Year, from PY2021 (April-December 2021) through PY2026 (Calendar Year 2026), ACOs and their Participant Providers may not simultaneously participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The determination of whether such an overlap exists during PY2021 – PY2026 will be made at the TIN level. During the GPDC / ACO REACH Model’s performance years (PY2021 – PY2026), Participant Providers may not simultaneously participate in the GPDC / ACO REACH Model and another model tested or expanded under section 1115A of the Act that involves shared savings, or any other Medicare initiative that involves shared savings unless otherwise permitted by CMS. For example, Participant Providers may not participate in the Kidney Care Choices model or the Vermont All-Payer ACO Model. In addition, for the Primary Care First model, Independence at Home demonstration, and the Maryland Primary Care Program, which have similar payment structures to the GPDC / ACO REACH Model, overlap is prohibited even though they are not shared savings initiatives. For each of these initiatives, overlap is determined based on the TIN/NPI combination of the participating clinicians.
There are different levels of financial risk and reward that an ACO may select under the GPDC / ACO REACH Model, and the extent of risk and reward may be limited on a percentage basis. The GPDC / ACO REACH Model offers two risk arrangement options: the Professional risk track and the Global risk track. In the Professional risk track, the ACO retains 50% of shared savings/losses with CMS, up to 5% under/over the benchmark, with risk corridors for savings/losses greater than 5%. In the Global risk track, the ACO retains 100% of shared savings/losses, up to 25% under/over the benchmark, with risk corridors for savings/losses greater than 25%. Given that the ACO retains 100% of any shared savings up to 25%, the Global risk track incorporates a “discount”, which is the primary mechanism for CMS to obtain savings from ACOs participating in this risk track. Under the GPDC model, this discount was 2% of the benchmark. Under the ACO REACH model, this discount is 3% of the benchmark for PY2023-24, increasing to 3.5% for PY2025-26. APA ACO has opted for the Global risk track.
The ACO REACH Model offers two payment mechanisms:
•Primary Care Capitation (“PCC”). ACOs who have selected the Professional risk track may only opt for PCC. ACOs who have selected the Global risk track may opt for either PCC or Total Care Capitation (“TCC”). In PCC arrangements, ACOs will receive a per-beneficiary, per-month (PBPM) capitated payment for primary care services provided to aligned beneficiaries by all Participant Providers and those Preferred Providers who have opted to participate in PCC Payment. 
•Total Care Capitation. This payment arrangement is only available to ACOs who have selected the Global risk track. In TCC arrangements, ACOs will receive a PBPM capitated payment for all services provided to aligned beneficiaries by all Participant Providers and those Preferred Providers who have opted to participate in TCC payment. This TCC Payment amount will reflect the estimated total cost of care for the ACO’s aligned population.
APAACO opted for, and was approved by CMS to participate in, TCC, under the Global risk track, which is the most advanced risk-taking payment model in the GPDC / ACO REACH program. Under TCC in the Global risk track, APAACO is responsible for paying all Part A and Part B costs for in-network Participant Providers and Preferred Providers with whom it has contracted. In addition, APAACO is at risk for the total sum of all Part A and Part B expenditures incurred by its GPDC and ACO REACH patients, including expenditures incurred by its patients outside of APAACO’s network of Participant and Preferred Providers. Throughout the GPDC and ACO REACH programs, a substantial portion of APAACO’s spending benchmark is held at-risk by CMS, subject to APAACO meeting certain quality measures as determined by CMS. In the GPDC program, the portion of the benchmark held at-risk by CMS for quality was 5% of the benchmark. In the ACO REACH program, the portion of the benchmark held at-risk by CMS for quality is 2% of the benchmark.
Our Revenue Streams
Our revenue reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes revenue generated by our subsidiaries and consolidated entities. Revenue generated by consolidated entities, however, does not necessarily result in available or distributable cash for ApolloMed. Some revenue is generated from Excluded Assets that remain solely for the benefit of APC and its shareholders. Our revenue streams flow from various multi-year renewable contractual arrangements that vary by type of business operation as follows:
Capitation Revenue
Our capitation revenue consists primarily of capitated fees for medical services we provide under capitated arrangements made directly with various managed care providers, including HMOs. Capitation revenue is typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of enrollees selecting us as their healthcare provider. Capitation is a fixed payment amount per patient per unit of time paid in advance for the delivery of healthcare services, whereby the service providers are generally liable for excess medical costs. The actual amount paid is determined by the ranges of services provided, the number of patients enrolled, and the period of time during which the services are provided. Capitation rates are generally based on local costs and average utilization of services. Because Medicare pays capitation using a “Risk Adjustment” model, which compensates managed care providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual enrollee, managed care providers with higher acuity enrollees receive more, and those with lower acuity enrollees receive less, capitation that can be allocated to service providers. Under the Risk Adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled.
Per member per month (“PMPM”) managed care contracts generally have a term of one year or longer. All managed care contracts have a single performance obligation that constitutes a series for the provision of managed healthcare services for a population of enrolled members for the duration of the contract. The transaction price for PMPM contracts is variable, as it primarily includes PMPM fees associated with unspecified membership that fluctuates throughout the term of the contract. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives, performance guarantees, and risk shares. 
Risk Pool Settlements and Incentives
Capitation arrangements are supplemented by risk-sharing arrangements. We have two different types of capitation risk-sharing arrangements: full-risk and shared-risk arrangements.
We enter into full-risk capitation arrangements with certain health plans and local hospitals, which are administered by a related party, where the hospital is responsible for providing, arranging, and paying for institutional risk. We are responsible for providing, arranging, and paying for professional risk. Under a full-risk pool-sharing agreement, we generally receive a percentage of the net surplus from the affiliated hospital’s risk pools with HMOs after deductions for the affiliated hospital’s costs. Advance settlement payments are typically made quarterly in arrears if there is a surplus. Risk pool settlements under arrangements with health plans and hospitals are recognized using the most likely amount methodology and amounts are only included in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. The assumptions for medical loss ratios (“MLR”), incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) completion factor and constraint percentages were used by management in applying the most likely amount methodology.
Under capitation arrangements with certain HMOs, we participate in one or more shared-risk arrangements relating to the provision of institutional services to enrollees (shared-risk arrangements) and thus can earn additional revenue or incur losses based upon the enrollee utilization of institutional services. Shared-risk capitation arrangements are entered into with certain health plans, which are administered by the health plan, where we are responsible for rendering professional services, but the health plan does not enter into a capitation arrangement with a hospital and therefore, the health plan retains the institutional risk. Shared-risk deficits, if any, are not payable until and unless (and only to the extent of any) risk-sharing surpluses are generated. At the termination of the HMO contract, any accumulated deficit will be extinguished.
In addition to risk-sharing revenues, we also receive incentives under “pay-for-performance” programs for quality medical care, based on various criteria. As an incentive to control enrollee utilization and to promote quality care, certain HMOs have designed quality incentive programs and commercial generic pharmacy incentive programs to compensate us for our efforts to improve the quality of services and to promote the efficient and effective use of pharmacy supplemental benefits provided to HMO members. The incentive programs track specific performance measures and calculate payments to us based on the performance measures.
Generally, for the foregoing arrangements, the final settlement is dependent on each distinct day’s performance within the annual measurement period, but cannot be allocated to specific days until the full measurement period has occurred and performance can be assessed.
Management Fee Income
Management fee income encompasses fees paid for management, physician advisory, healthcare staffing, administrative, and other non-medical services provided by us to IPAs, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. Such fees may be in the form of billings at agreed-upon hourly rates, percentages of revenue, or fee collections, or amounts fixed on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The revenue may include variable arrangements measuring factors such as hours staffed, patient visits, or collections per visit against benchmarks, and, in certain cases, may be subject to achieving quality metrics or fee collections.
GPDC / ACO REACH Revenue
Through APAACO, we participate in the Global Risk track with TCC in the GPDC / ACO REACH Model sponsored by CMS. Under the GPDC / ACO REACH Model, we recruit a group of Participant and Preferred (in-network) Providers. Based on the Participant Providers that join our ACO, CMS grants us a pool of Traditional Medicare patients (beneficiaries) to manage. Our beneficiaries will receive services from physicians and other medical service providers that are both in-network and out-of-network. Under TCC, CMS estimates an average of in-network monthly expenditures for APAACO’s aligned beneficiaries and pays that projected amount to us in monthly installments. We are then responsible for paying our in-network providers for all Part A and Part B expenditures incurred by our beneficiaries with those providers. In addition, we bear risk on all Part A and Part B expenditures (both in-network and out-of-network) based on a budgetary benchmark established with CMS. Claims from out-of-network providers are processed and paid by CMS. Our shared savings or losses in managing our beneficiaries are generally determined on an annual basis after reconciliation with CMS. Pursuant to our risk-share agreement with CMS, we will be eligible to receive the surplus (shared savings) or be liable for the deficit (shared losses) according to the budgetary benchmark established by CMS based on our efficiency or lack thereof, in managing the expenditures associated with beneficiaries aligned to us by CMS. We recognize such savings or deficit upon substantial completion of reconciliation and determination of the amounts. We also recognize the final budgetary benchmark established by CMS, net of discounts, and retrospective trend adjustments, as revenue. Our maximum shared savings or losses are determined by the risk track we elect with CMS. Under the Global Risk track, we are responsible for 100% of shared savings or losses up to 25% of the total budgetary benchmark established by CMS, with adjusted risk corridors taking effect for any proportion of shared savings / losses exceeding 25% of the benchmark—for savings/losses of 25-35% of the benchmark, we assume 50% risk responsibility, 
for savings/losses 35%-50% of the benchmark we assume 25% of the risk responsibility, and for savings/losses exceeding 50% of the benchmark, we assume only 10% of the risk responsibility.
NGACO AIPBP Revenue
Through APAACO, we participated in the AIPBP track of the NGACO Model sponsored by CMS. Under the NGACO Model, CMS granted us a pool of patients to manage (direct care and pay providers) based on a budgetary benchmark established with CMS. Pursuant to our risk-share agreement with CMS, we were eligible to receive the surplus or be liable for the deficit according to the budgetary benchmark established by CMS based on our efficiency or lack thereof, in managing how the beneficiaries aligned to us by CMS are served by in-network and out-of-network providers. Our shared savings or losses on providing such services are both capped by CMS. With the ending of the NGACO Model on December 31, 2021, we received $48.8 million and $21.8 million in risk pool savings related to the 2021 and 2020 performance years, respectively, and have recognized such amounts as revenue in the risk pool settlements and incentives in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Fee For Service Revenue
FFS revenue represents revenue earned under contracts in which we bill and collect the professional component of charges for medical services rendered by our contracted physicians and employed physicians. Under the FFS arrangements, we bill, and receive payments from, the hospitals and third-party payors for physician staffing and further bill patients or their third-party payors for patient care services provided.
Our Key Payors
A limited number of payors represent a significant portion of our net revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, four payors accounted for an aggregate of 59.0%, 49.6%, and 53.4% of our total net revenue, respectively.
Our Strengths and Advantages
The following are some of the material opportunities that we believe exist for our company:
Combination of Clinical, Administrative and Technology Capabilities
We believe our key strength lies in our combined clinical, administrative, and technology capabilities. While many companies separately provide clinical, MSO, or technology support services, to our knowledge there are currently very few organizations like us that provide all three types of services to approximately 1.3 million patients as of December 31, 2022.
Diversification
Through our subsidiaries, consolidated affiliates, and invested entities, we have been able to reduce our business risk and increase revenue opportunities by diversifying our service offerings and expanding our ability to manage patient care across a horizontally integrated care network. Our revenue is spread across our operations. Additionally, with our ability to monitor and manage care within our wide network, we are an attractive business partner to health plans, hospitals, IPAs, and other medical groups seeking to provide better care at lower costs.
Strong Management Team
Our management team has, collectively, several decades of experience managing physician practices, risk-based organizations, health plans, hospitals, and health systems, a deep understanding of the healthcare marketplace and emerging trends, and a vision for the future of healthcare delivery led by physician-driven healthcare networks.
A Robust Physician Network
As of December 31, 2022, our physician network consisted of approximately 11,000 contracted physicians, including primary care physicians, specialist physicians, and hospitalists, through our affiliated physician groups and ACOs.
Cultural Affinities with Patients
In addition to delivering premium healthcare, we believe in the importance of providing services that are sensitive to the needs of local communities, including their cultural affinities. This value is shared by physicians within our affiliated IPAs and medical groups, and promotes patient comfort in communicating with care providers.
Long-Standing Relationships with Partners
We have developed long-standing relationships with and have earned trust from multiple health plans, hospitals, IPAs, and other medical groups that have helped to generate recurring contractual revenue for us.
Comprehensive and Effective Healthcare Management Programs
We offer comprehensive and effective healthcare management programs to patients. We have developed expertise in population health management and care coordination, and in proper medical coding, which results in improved Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) scores and higher payments from health plans, and in improving quality metrics in both inpatient and outpatient settings and thus patient satisfaction and CMS scores. Using our own proprietary risk assessment scoring tool, we have also developed our own protocol for identifying high-risk patients.
Competition
The healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for customers across all of our services with other healthcare management companies, including MSOs and healthcare providers, such as local, regional, and national networks of physicians, medical groups, and hospitals, many of which are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial and other resources, including personnel, than we have.
IPAs
Our affiliated IPAs compete with other IPAs, medical groups, and hospitals, many of which have greater financial, personnel, and other resources available to them. In the greater Los Angeles area, such competitors include Regal Medical Group and Lakeside Medical Group, which are part of Heritage Provider Network (“Heritage”), as well as Optum (f.k.a. HealthCare Partners), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group.
ACOs
APAACO competes with other sophisticated provider groups in the creation, administration, and management of ACOs, many of which have greater financial, personnel, and other resources available to them. Major competitors of APAACO include Privia Health and Aledade.
Outpatient Clinics
Our outpatient clinics compete with large ambulatory surgery centers and/or diagnostic centers such as RadNet and Envision Healthcare, many of which have greater financial, personnel, and other resources available to them, as well as smaller clinics that have ties to local communities. Optum (f.k.a. HealthCare Partners) also has its own urgent care centers, clinics, and diagnostic centers.
Hospitalists
Because individual physicians may provide hospitalist services if they have necessary credentials and privileges, the markets for hospitalist services are highly fragmented. Our affiliated hospitalist groups face competition primarily from numerous small inpatient practices in existing and expanding markets, but also compete with large physician groups, many of which have greater financial, personnel, and other resources available to them. Some of such competitors operate on a national level, including EmCare, Team Health, and Sound Physicians.
Regulatory Matters
As a healthcare company, our operations and relationships with healthcare providers, such as hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals, are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, CMS, and various state authorities. These laws and regulations often are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively. Imposition of liabilities associated with a violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We cannot guarantee that our practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate certain healthcare laws. Government investigations and prosecutions, even if we are ultimately found to be without fault, can be costly and disruptive to our business. Moreover, changes in healthcare legislation or government regulation may restrict our existing operations, limit our expansion, or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Below are brief descriptions of some, but not all, of such laws and regulations that affect our business operations.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Our consolidated financial statements include our subsidiaries and VIEs. Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners, such as ApolloMed and its subsidiaries, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, or exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. These laws are generally referred to as corporate practice of medicine laws. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws permit only physicians to practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions, or engage in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In these states, a violation of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition constitutes the unlawful practice of medicine, which is a public offense punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. In addition, any physician who participates in a scheme that violates the state’s corporate practice of medicine prohibition may be punished for aiding and abetting a lay entity in the unlawful practice of medicine.
California is a corporate practice of medicine state, and we operate by maintaining long-term MSAs with our affiliated IPAs and medical groups, each of which is owned and operated by physicians only, and employs or contracts with additional physicians to provide medical services. Under such MSAs, our wholly owned MSOs are contracted to provide non-medical management and administrative services, such as financial and risk management, as well as information systems, marketing, and administrative support to the IPAs and medical groups. The MSAs typically have an initial term of 1-10 years and are generally not terminable by our affiliated IPAs and medical groups except in the case of bankruptcy, gross negligence, fraud, or other illegal acts by the contracting MSO.
Through the MSAs and the relationship with the physician owners of our medical affiliates, we have exclusive authority over all non-medical decisions related to the ongoing business operations of those affiliates. Consequently, ApolloMed consolidates the revenue and expenses of such affiliates as their primary beneficiary from the date of execution of the applicable MSA. When necessary, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Thomas Lam, serves as nominee shareholder of affiliated medical practices on ApolloMed’s behalf, in order to comply with corporate practice of medicine laws and certain accounting rules applicable to consolidated financial reporting by our affiliates as VIEs.
Under these arrangements, our MSOs perform only non-medical functions, do not represent to offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by physicians. The California Medical Board, as well as other states’ regulatory bodies, has taken the position that MSAs that confer too much control over a physician practice to MSOs may violate the prohibition against corporate practice of medicine. Some of the relevant laws, regulations, and agency interpretations in California and other states that have corporate practice prohibitions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. Moreover, state laws and regulatory interpretations are subject to change. Other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, ApolloMed and its subsidiaries are engaged in the prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that such arrangements constitute unlawful fee-splitting between physicians and non-physicians. If this occurred, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our MSAs could be found legally invalid and unenforceable in whole or in part, and we could be required to restructure arrangements with our affiliated IPAs and medical groups. If we were required to change our operating structures due to determination that a corporate practice of medicine violation existed, such a restructuring might require revising our MSOs’ management fees.
False Claims Acts
The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 - 3733, imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim for payment approved. Private parties may initiate qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the federal government and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs. By way of illustration, these prosecutions may be based upon alleged coding errors, billing for services not rendered, billing services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. The federal government and a number of courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of certain other statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, can also be considered a violation of the False Claims Act based on the theory that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement.
Penalties for False Claims Act violations include substantial fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties as well as exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to the provisions of the False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government for payments.
A number of states including California have enacted laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Under Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”), as amended, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, the state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under the state’s false claims act. As a result, more states are expected to enact laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act in the future along with a corresponding increase in state false claims enforcement efforts. In addition, Section 6032 of the DRA requires entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5.0 million or more from any one state to provide their employees, contractors, and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state False Claims Acts and related statues. 
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a provision of the Social Security Act of 1972 that prohibits as a felony offense the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (1) the referral of a patient for items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs or (3) the purchase, lease, or order or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) amended section 1128B of the Social Security Act to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. The OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted as its standard for review a judicial interpretation, which concludes that the statute prohibits any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil fines, and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A violation also can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, pursuant to the changes of the ACA, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a false claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Due to the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute’s broad prohibitions, statutory exceptions exist that protect certain arrangements from prosecution. In addition, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that specify arrangements that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of an activity to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but these arrangements may be subject to scrutiny and prosecution by enforcement agencies. We may be less willing than some competitors to take actions or enter into arrangements that do not clearly satisfy the OIG safe harbors and suffer a competitive disadvantage.
On December 2, 2020, in conjunction with HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care, the OIG finalized modifications to existing safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and added new safe harbors and a new exception to the civil monetary penalty provision prohibiting inducements to beneficiaries, the purpose of which was to remove potential barriers to more effective coordination and management of patient care and delivery of value-based care. The changes implemented by the final rules went into effect on January 19, 2021. These or other changes implemented by OIG in the future may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, but which may be applicable regardless of the payor source for the patient. These state laws may contain exceptions and safe harbors that are different from and/or more limited than those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. For example, California has adopted the Physician Ownership and Referral Act of 1993 (“PORA”). PORA makes it unlawful for physicians, surgeons, and other licensed professionals to refer a person for certain healthcare services if they have a financial interest with the person or entity that receives the referral. While PORA also provides certain exemptions from this prohibition, failure to fit within an exemption in violation of PORA can lead to a misdemeanor offense that may subject a physician to civil penalties and disciplinary action by the Medical Board of California.
For example, Section 445 of the California Health and Safety Code, provides that “no person, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent or employee thereof, shall for profit refer or recommend a person to a physician, hospital, health-related facility, or dispensary for any form of medical care or treatment of any ailment or physical condition. The imposition of a fee or charge of any such referral or recommendation creates a presumption that the referral or recommendation is for profit.” A violation of Section 445 is a misdemeanor and may subject the offender to imprisonment and/or monetary fines. Further, a violation of Section 445 may be enjoined by the California Attorney General. Section 650 of the California Business and Professions Code contains prohibitions against self-referral and kickbacks. Business & Professions Code Section 650 makes it unlawful for a “licensee,” including a physician, to pay or receive any compensation or inducement for referring patients, clients, or customers to any person or entity, irrespective of any membership or proprietary interest in or with the person or entity receiving the referral. Violation of the statute is a public offense punishable by imprisonment and/or monetary fines. Section 650 further provides that it is not unlawful for a physician to refer a patient to a healthcare facility solely because the physician has a proprietary interest or co-ownership in a healthcare facility, provided that (1) the physician’s return on investment for that proprietary interest or co-ownership is based upon the amount of capital investment or proportional ownership of the physician; and (2) the ownership interest is not based on the number or value of any patients referred. A violation of Section 650 is a misdemeanor and may subject the offender to imprisonment and/or monetary fines.
We cannot assure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, or other healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Antitrust Laws
The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. A review or action by regulatory authorities or the courts that is negative in nature as to the relationship between us and the physician groups or IPAs which we manage or contract with, could force us to terminate those contractual relationships. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.
Stark Laws
The federal Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing “designated health services,” if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient prescription drug services, clinical laboratory services, certain imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound), and other services that our affiliated physicians may order for their patients. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral, and therefore, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, intent to violate the law is not required. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.
Because the Stark Law and implementing regulations continue to evolve and are detailed and complex, while we attempt to structure its relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, there can be no assurance that the arrangements entered into by us with affiliated physicians and facilities will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be implemented or interpreted. The penalties for violating the Stark Law can include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, and civil penalties for each violation, double damages, and possible exclusion from future participation in the governmental healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may face substantial fines for each applicable arrangement or scheme. 
On December 2, 2020, in conjunction with HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care, CMS issued a final rule intended to address the regulatory impact and burden of the Stark Law that impeded the healthcare system’s move toward value-based reimbursement. CMS added new exceptions to attempt to address potential barriers to coordinated care and value-based care. The changes implemented by the final rules went into effect on January 19, 2021. These or other changes implemented by CMS in the future may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations against self-referral arrangements similar to the federal Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. For example, California has adopted the Physician Ownership and Referral Act of 1993 (“PORA”). PORA makes it unlawful for physicians, surgeons, and other licensed professionals to refer a person for certain healthcare services if they have a financial interest with the person or entity that receives the referral. While PORA also provides certain exemptions from this prohibition, failure to fit within an exemption in violation of PORA can lead to a misdemeanor offense that may subject a physician to civil penalties and disciplinary action by the Medical Board of California.
An adverse determination under these state laws and/or the federal Stark Law could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, or other healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Health Information Privacy and Security Standards
The privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information (“PHI”) by entities like our MSOs and affiliated IPAs and medical groups. HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. HIPAA also implemented standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including billing and claim collection activities. New health information standards could have a significant effect on the manner in which we do business, and the cost of complying with new standards could be significant.
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules may result in civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil money penalties. A HIPAA-covered entity must also promptly notify affected individuals where a breach affects more than 500 individuals and report annually any breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals.
State attorneys general may bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, obtain damages on behalf of state residents, and enjoin further violations. Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information, which may be similar to or even more stringent than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for monetary penalties and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Both state and federal laws are subject to modification or enhancement of privacy protection at any time.
If we fail to comply with HIPAA or similar state laws, we could incur substantial civil monetary or criminal penalties. We expect increased federal and state privacy and security enforcement efforts.
Knox-Keene Act and State Insurance Laws
The Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Health and Safety Code Section 1340, et seq.), as amended (the “Knox-Keene Act”), is the California law that regulates managed care plans. Neither our MSOs nor their managed medical groups and IPAs hold a Knox-Keene license. Some of the medical groups and IPAs that have entered into MSAs with our MSOs have historically contracted with health plans and other payors to receive capitation payments and assumed the financial responsibility for professional services. In many of these cases, the health plans or other payors separately enter into contracts with hospitals that receive payments and assume some type of contractual financial responsibility for their institutional services. In some instances, our affiliated medical groups and IPAs have been paid by their contracting payors or hospitals for the financial outcome of managing the care costs associated with both the professional and institutional services received by patients, and have recognized a percentage of the surplus of institutional revenues less institutional expense as the medical groups’ and IPAs’ net revenues; and, under certain circumstances, may be responsible for a percentage of any shortfall in the event that institutional expenses exceed institutional revenues. While our MSOs and their managed medical groups and IPAs are not contractually obligated to pay claims to hospitals or other institutions under these arrangements, if it is determined that our MSOs or the medical groups and IPAs have been inappropriately taking financial risk for institutional and professional services without Knox-Keene license or regulatory exemption as a result of their hospital and physician arrangements, we may be required to obtain a restricted Knox-Keene license to resolve such violations and we could be subject to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
In addition, some states require ACOs to be registered or otherwise comply with state insurance laws. Our ACOs are not registered with any state insurance agency. If it is determined that we have been inappropriately operating an ACO without state registration or licensure, we may be required to obtain such registration or licensure to resolve such violations and we could be subject to liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations
We are subject to federal, state, and local regulations governing the storage, use, and disposal of waste materials and products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling, and disposing of these materials and products comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance policies, which we may not be able to maintain on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and the attention of our management could be diverted to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us, including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are being implemented, which could adversely affect our operations.
Other Federal and State Healthcare Laws
We are also subject to other federal and state healthcare laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Health Care Fraud Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute prohibits, in any matter involving a federal healthcare program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up, by any trick, scheme, or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in substantial penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties against any physician who knowingly accepts payment from a hospital (as well as against the hospital making the payment) as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided to Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiaries. Further, except as permitted under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil money penalties for each wrongful act.
In addition to the state laws previously described, we may also be subject to other state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations if we expand our operations beyond California. Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope and interpretations of these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Generally, state laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. A determination of liability under any of these laws could result in fines, penalties, and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
Licensure, Certification, Accreditation, and Related Laws and Guidelines
Our clinical personnel are subject to numerous federal, state, and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Clinical professionals are also subject to state and federal regulation regarding prescribing medication and controlled substances. Our affiliated physicians and hospitalists must satisfy and maintain their individual professional licensing in each state where they practice medicine, including California, and many states require that nurse practitioners and physician assistants work in collaboration with or under the supervision of a physician. Each state defines the scope of practice of clinical professionals through legislation and through the respective Boards of Medicine and Nursing. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject our clinical personnel to sanctions, or to even lose their license and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well. Some state boards of medicine impose reciprocal discipline, that is, if a physician is disciplined for having committed professional misconduct in one state where they are licensed, another state where they are also licensed may impose the same discipline even though the conduct occurred in another state. Since we and our affiliated medical groups perform services at hospitals and other healthcare facilities, we may indirectly be subject to laws, ethical guidelines, and operating standards of professional trade associations and private accreditation commissions (such as the American Medical Association and The Joint Commission) applicable to those entities. Penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards include loss of professional license, civil or criminal fines and penalties, loss of hospital admitting privileges, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. In addition, our affiliated facilities are subject to state and local licensing regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability, and the ability of our affiliated physicians and facilities, to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals and operate in compliance with applicable healthcare and other laws and regulations that evolve rapidly. We provide home health, hospice, and palliative care, which require compliance with additional regulatory requirements. Reimbursement for palliative care and house call services is generally conditioned on clinical professionals providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service and the medical necessity for the service. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information, or the incorrect selection of codes for the level and type of service provided, could result in non-payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. We must also comply with laws relating to hospice care eligibility, development, and maintenance of care plans and coordination with nursing homes or assisted living facilities where patients live.
Professional Liability and Other Insurance Coverage
Our business has an inherent and significant risk of claims of medical malpractice against us and our affiliated physicians. We and our affiliated physician groups pay premiums for third-party professional liability insurance that provides indemnification on a claims-made basis for losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation in order to carry out our operations. Our physicians are required to carry first dollar coverage with limits of liability equal to not less than $1.0 million for claims based on occurrence up to an aggregate of $3.0 million per year. Our IPAs purchase stop-loss insurance, which will reimburse them for claims from service providers on a per enrollee basis. The specific retention amount per enrollee per policy period is $45,000 to $100,000 for professional coverage. We also maintain workers’ compensation, director and officer, and other third-party insurance coverage subject to deductibles and other restrictions that we believe are in accordance with industry standards. While we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate based upon claims experience and the nature and risks of our business, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of pending or future claims asserted against us or our affiliated physician groups in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable. The ultimate resolution of pending and future claims in excess of our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
