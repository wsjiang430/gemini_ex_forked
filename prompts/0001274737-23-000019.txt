Company Overview 
Exagen is dedicated to transforming the care continuum for patients suffering from debilitating and chronic autoimmune diseases by enabling timely differential diagnosis and optimizing therapeutic intervention. We have developed and are commercializing a portfolio of innovative testing products under our AVISE® brand, several of which incorporate Cell-Bound Complement Activation Products (CB-CAPs) technology. CB-CAPs assess the activation of the complement system, a biological pathway that is widely implicated across many autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our goal is to enable healthcare providers to improve care for patients through the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
We market testing products under our AVISE® brand that allow for the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. Our lead testing product, AVISE® CTD, enables differential diagnosis for patients presenting with symptoms indicative of a wide variety of connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and other related diseases with overlapping symptoms. The comprehensive nature of AVISE® CTD allows for the testing of a number of relevant biomarkers in one convenient blood draw, as opposed to testing serially for individual biomarkers, which adds time and cost to the diagnostic process. We believe AVISE® CTD may provide clinical utility for over 24 million patients in the United States suffering from these diseases, which include SLE, RA, Sjögren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), other autoimmune-related diseases such as autoimmune thyroid, and other disorders that mimic these diseases, such as fibromyalgia. There is an unmet need for rheumatologists to add clarity in their CTD clinical evaluation, and we believe there is a significant opportunity for our tests that enable the differential diagnosis of these diseases, particularly for potentially life-threatening diseases such as SLE. 
AVISE® CTD leverages CB-CAPs technology to enable the differential diagnosis of SLE. AVISE® CTD provides rheumatologists and their patients with sensitive and specific results that allow for potentially faster and more accurate differential diagnosis of SLE as compared to other currently-marketed testing methods. Beyond SLE, AVISE® CTD allows rheumatologists to accurately diagnose other overlapping autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including RA, with the same blood sample. 
Our AVISE® SLE Monitor testing product also leverages CB-CAPs technology by measuring two CB-CAPs biomarkers that offer insight into a patient’s disease activity. This test is designed to enable rheumatologists to effectively assess and optimize therapeutic intervention in patients diagnosed with SLE. Depending on disease severity, AVISE® SLE Monitor may be utilized by patients multiple times a year throughout their lives. 
Our RA-focused testing products include AVISE® MTX and AVISE® Anti-CarP. AVISE® MTX is a drug monitoring test designed to aid in the optimization of methotrexate therapy, the standard of care and first-line therapy for patients with RA. AVISE® MTX is based on our proprietary methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG) technology that measures blood levels of MTXPGs, the active metabolite of methotrexate linked to disease control in RA patients. Measuring MTXPGs allows rheumatologists to identify patients presenting with inadequate exposure to methotrexate enabling them to optimize dosing and achieve therapeutic levels commensurate with adequate disease control. AVISE® Touch, the low-volume test sample collection method, is no longer offered for any of our testing products. AVISE® Anti-CarP, which measures anti-carbamylated protein antibody (anti-CarP), was developed by the Leiden University Medical Center, and we introduced it as a biomarker-driven RA prognostic test through a distribution agreement with Werfen USA, LLC with the goal of identifying patients prone to more severe disease.
We market our AVISE® testing products using our specialized sales force. Since the launch of AVISE® CTD in 2012 and through December 31, 2022, we have delivered approximately 750,000 of these tests. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 135,210 AVISE® CTD tests were delivered, representing an approximate 5% increase over 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of ordering healthcare providers reached a record 2,419 compared to 2,126 in the same period in 2021.
In addition, we continue to populate a growing proprietary database of de-identified patient test results from our clinical studies and our clinical laboratory. We believe the insight emerging from these results has the potential to unlock value for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the development and commercialization of therapeutics. We believe we also have the ability to further leverage our database to optimize patient selection in clinical trials for companies developing therapeutics for autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We plan to collaborate with our existing and future pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to help maximize the full value of our in-house database.
Our Strategy 
We address the unmet needs of those suffering from debilitating and chronic autoimmune disorders through aiding in the differential diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and therapeutic selection, to ultimately improve the continuum of care for patients. The key tenets of our business strategy include: 
▪Focus on our flagship product, AVISE® CTD. We have demonstrated a solid track record of commercial growth of our AVISE® CTD test. We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue expanding our commercial presence within the autoimmune disease market by leveraging our specialized sales force and expansive network of relationships with rheumatologists across the United States. Using our specialty laboratory focused on rheumatology, we plan to build upon industry-leading quality, service and technology to support strong AVISE® CTD adoption and continue to grow our ordering physician base. 
▪Continue developing innovative testing products, using clear criteria for R&D projects and commercialization milestones. We intend to leverage our protein and molecular assay development capabilities, bioinformatic team and proprietary technologies to pursue the development of additional testing products designed to have superior clinical utility for CTDs. We undertake research projects that have the potential for impactful results and address the top consumer needs in the rheumatology space. The research projects we support will be those that we believe will have a competitive advantage (such as using proprietary technology), a pathway for reimbursement and an established evidence development plan with sufficient market size. Criteria for developed products that we ultimately commercialize include Medicare coverage (specific to patient population), proprietary value-based pricing, published clinical utility and a strategy for medical guideline inclusion. 
▪Maintain meaningful margin. We seek to maintain meaningful margin by continuing to focus on increasing operating leverage through the implementation of internal initiatives, such as leveraging validation and reimbursement-oriented clinical studies to facilitate payor coverage of our testing products. We plan to increase our focus on long-term reimbursement and average sales price (ASP) growth, by optimizing revenue cycle practices, focusing managed care efforts on medical policy expansion and continuing to educate insurance payors on the published, real-world evidence of the clinical utility of our testing products, showing healthcare cost savings and reductions in time to diagnosis.
We also seek to improve our per-test costs by focusing on profitable, core test offerings, reducing fixed costs and overhead, and focusing our laboratory resources on AVISE® CTD optimization. Additionally, we employ a streamlined salesforce covering territories which are designed to achieve the most efficient and effective reach and frequency for the promotion of AVISE® CTD.
We are currently aligning the organization with this new focus to best accomplish our goals.
Autoimmune and Connective Tissue Diseases 
Autoimmune diseases encompass a broad range of serious, chronic and debilitating conditions in which a person’s immune system creates antibodies that mistakenly react against normal healthy tissues causing inflammation and irreversible tissue damage. These antibodies are called autoantibodies and their detection through blood tests can help diagnose, prognose and monitor the course of autoimmune diseases. However, knowing when and which autoantibody to test for is challenging due to the vagueness of symptoms, the unexplained flaring and remission of symptoms, and the many conditions which can mimic autoimmune disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of the conditions causing these overlapping symptoms is critical as an incorrect diagnosis can lead to toxicity from inappropriate medications, irreversible tissue damage and other comorbidities associated with uncontrolled disease. There is no known cause or cure for these chronic conditions and current treatment interventions are targeted at managing symptoms and limiting disease progression. 
CTDs are a sub-category of autoimmune diseases involving inflammation of the joints, tissues and internal organs. Persons with CTDs often present to their rheumatologist with complaints of joint pain, fatigue, unexplained fever, inflammation, rash, stiffness and muscle aches. These symptoms overlap among numerous CTDs, including SLE, one of the most severe CTDs and historically difficult to rule out, as well as other autoimmune-related diseases and other disorders that mimic these diseases, such as fibromyalgia. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences estimates that there are approximately 24 million patients in the United States with existing cases of autoimmune diseases. Of these patients, we estimate approximately seven million are potentially referable to rheumatologists and would be candidates for an AVISE® CTD test, representing a total addressable market of approximately $7.5 billion, based on the current Medicare allowable reimbursement rate. We estimate the total addressable market for our AVISE® testing products to be approximately $9.0 billion, based on estimated patient populations, the current Medicare allowable reimbursement rate and testing frequencies. 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
SLE, the most common and severe form of lupus, is a chronic, inflammatory disorder that can damage any part of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. The blood of a person afflicted with SLE contains autoantibodies, which are the cause of the inflammation and organ damage and are one indicator of immune system abnormalities. SLE is characterized by a rise in symptoms and/or abnormal laboratory test results. SLE varies in severity, from mild cases to those in which significant and potentially fatal damage occurs to vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and lungs. Detection of these autoantibodies can assist rheumatologists in the diagnosis of SLE. Diagnosis of SLE allows rheumatologists to initiate the most appropriate therapy to minimize irreversible organ damage and reduce morbidity and mortality. Current treatment for SLE involves the use of antimalarials, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and biologic agents to prevent or suppress active disease or flares. 
Standard laboratory tests for diagnosing SLE include measuring immunological biomarkers, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and other autoantibody tests. ANA are a group of autoantibodies produced by a person’s immune system when it fails to adequately distinguish between self and non-self. The ANA test detects these autoantibodies in the blood and is a useful screening tool for SLE and other autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. The vast majority of SLE patients test positive for ANA. However, the high sensitivity of ANA for SLE is counterbalanced by somewhat poor specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of patients who are correctly identified as having a particular condition, while specificity measures the proportion of patients who are correctly identified as not having a particular condition. Therefore, the majority of individuals who test positive for ANA do not have SLE. Approximately 11-13% of individuals with a positive ANA test have SLE. This lack of specificity leads to many inappropriate non-autoimmune referrals to the rheumatologist from primary care physicians. For example, it has been reported that 30% of fibromyalgia patients may test positive for ANA, potentially generating as many as four million inappropriate rheumatology referrals. In addition, a study published in 2012 reported the estimated prevalence of a positive ANA test in the normal, healthy, U.S. population to be 13.8% (32 million people), indicating a significant need for a highly-specific test for this disease. 
Anti-dsDNA are autoantibodies that target a person’s double-stranded DNA. The anti-dsDNA antibody test is a very specific test for SLE as anti-dsDNA antibodies are rarely found in autoimmune diseases other than SLE. A strongly positive anti-dsDNA antibody test makes it very likely that a person has SLE, although if the test is negative it does not necessarily rule out SLE. Many people with SLE have a negative anti-dsDNA antibody test, reaffirming the need for an effective testing product which adds clarity to the rheumatologist’s clinical assessment. 
Activation of the complement system is an integral part of the disease process of SLE. Thus, rheumatologists measure components of the complement system, including serum levels of C3 and C4, to help diagnose SLE and monitor SLE disease activity. In 2012, the Systemic Lupus Collaborating Clinics added low C3 and low C4 as immunologic criteria for classifying SLE. In active SLE, C3 and C4 complement proteins are consumed and broken down to fragments, known as complement activation products. Therefore, low levels of C3 and C4 suggest a diagnosis of SLE and that the disease is active. However, variability in the levels of C3 and C4 can occur due to factors unrelated to SLE disease presence or disease activity, making them less reliable as biomarkers for SLE. For example, C3 and C4 are acute-phase reactants and produced during inflammation. As a result, many SLE patients have normal complement levels even when the disease is active. Although relatively specific for SLE, low complement levels can also be seen in certain chronic infections, including non-lupus-related kidney inflammation, severe liver disease and other autoimmune diseases. CB-CAPs are formed when the fragments of complement activation products from C4 bind permanently to circulating cells such as red blood cells, b-cells and platelets. This binding lasts for the life of the cell and represents a more stable and reliable indicator of complement activation than measuring C3 and C4 alone. 
In March 2011, the first new biologic targeting treatment of SLE in over 50 years, GSK’s Benlysta®, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA), and in December 2020, the FDA approved this biologic drug for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis who are receiving standard therapy. Since Benlysta®'s approval, there have been a number of drug development programs that have failed in SLE, which may suggest that guidelines for classifying SLE patients and the endpoints used to determine clinical effectiveness have not adequately addressed the complexity of the disease process and its heterogeneous population. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the joints and can also affect other organ systems. The annual incidence and prevalence of RA in the United States is estimated to be 135,000 and 1.5 million, respectively. Patients suffering from RA develop joint damage that is associated with painful inflammation and often progresses to irreversible damage of cartilage and bone, leading to significant disability and a reduction in quality of life and the ability to work. Early diagnosis and effective treatment of RA is critically 
important to prevent erosive bone or joint damage and disability. Rheumatologists are compelled to reach a definitive diagnosis quickly and administer effective treatment. 
Diagnosis of RA involves performing a complete medical history with physical and/or radiographic examination of the number and distribution of swollen, tender and painful joints that have persisted for more than six weeks. Laboratory testing for rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and testing for general, nonspecific inflammation with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the ESR) and C-reactive protein tests are used to assist in the diagnosis. 
The standard of care for the treatment for RA involves the use of Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) which have shown, in clinical studies, the ability to slow or stop disease progression. Methotrexate remains the most commonly used DMARD, due to its low cost, effectiveness, and the extensive clinical experience with its use. It is estimated that approximately 90% of RA patients in the United States, or 1.3 million patients, are treated with methotrexate, either as a monotherapy or in combination with another DMARD. 
Biologics DMARDs are proteins that have been genetically modified to target cellular components of the immune system that attack healthy tissues causing the symptoms of RA. They are a targeted form of therapy, which makes them different from traditional RA treatments, such as methotrexate. The first FDA approved biologics for RA were the anti-TNFs. The anti-TNFs dominate the therapy for RA and generally are the first biologics chosen to augment methotrexate when patients are not achieving a satisfactory response. 
Our Solution 
We market testing products under our AVISE® brand that allow for the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including SLE and RA. Our product portfolio integrates CB-CAPs technology, which is a stable and reliable method for differentially diagnosing SLE. We are focused on leveraging our sales channel targeting the approximately 4,500 rheumatologists across the United States. 
Our Proprietary Technologies 
We have two core proprietary technologies, CB-CAPs and MTXPGs, which form the backbone of several of our testing products. 
CB-CAPs 
Our proprietary CB-CAPs technology determines the blood levels of complement activation proteins permanently deposited on hematopoietic cells. The determination of complement proteins in a patient’s blood is a mainstay in clinical laboratory science, and state-of-the-art methods traditionally rely on measurement of serum or plasma levels of soluble complements. C3 and C4 are the most commonly determined complement proteins in the blood and the precursors to activation of complement proteins into biologically active breakdown products. However, there are limitations with measuring C3 and C4 blood levels as indicators of complement activation. For example, increased synthesis of C3 and C4 by the liver can offset increased C3 and C4 breakdown during activation of the complement cascade, resulting in no change in serum levels. While the limitations and drawbacks of measuring standard components of the complement system, such as C3 and C4, are well recognized by the medical community, these laboratory biomarkers are part of international guidelines for the classification of SLE. 
We believe the availability of novel complement biomarkers supporting or replacing standard C3 and C4 measures will be of great value for rheumatologists and ultimately their patients. Our CB-CAPs technology directly measures protein products of complement activation, such as C4d, the product of C4 activation. These complement activation products become stably attached to surfaces of circulating blood cells to become CB-CAPs. As such, the determination of CB-CAPs in the blood provides benefits when compared to the traditional complement measurement. These include the stable, accurate and unequivocal information of complement activation that enable consistent measurement and an improved ability to assess and monitor changes in biological activity related to activation of the complement system. In a head-to-head study published in 2014, CB-CAPs (EC4d or BC4d) showed 22% higher sensitivity (66%) than C3 and C4 (44%) in diagnosing SLE, with specificity fixed at 91%. 
MTXPGs 
Methotrexate is the standard of care and first-line treatment of many autoimmune diseases including RA and psoriatic arthritis. Our proprietary technology measures blood levels of MTXPGs, which are the active metabolite of methotrexate. The technology uses a dried capillary blood-based collection method coupled with liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry and quantifies nanomolar concentrations of MTXPG using at least two 
orders of magnitude lower blood volume than venipuncture. MTXPG blood levels are actionable clinical utility checkpoints and can help clinicians identify causes for a lack of response to methotrexate, such as poor activation to active metabolites, underexposure secondary to poor absorption or poor compliance, all of which are limiting factors to the achievement of a robust clinical response with this first-line treatment. We believe we can leverage this technology to optimize anti-TNF treatment by reducing the formation of anti-drug antibodies that are known to impact the clinical efficacy of these drugs. 
Testing Products 
Since inception, we have been committed to developing and commercializing innovative testing products that address the challenges rheumatologists face in differentially diagnosing, prognosing and monitoring complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We estimate the total addressable market for our AVISE® testing products to be approximately $9 billion, based on estimated patient populations, the current Medicare allowable reimbursement rate and testing frequencies. 
Diagnosis 
AVISE® CTD 
Our lead testing product, AVISE® CTD, is a comprehensive test that aids in the differential diagnosis of SLE versus other common CTDs. The SLE portion of the test employs CB-CAPs technology and specifically measures activation of the complement system by quantifying the level of two CB-CAPs biomarkers in the patient’s blood, B-cell C4d (BC4d), and erythrocyte bound C4d (EC4d), which are higher in patients with SLE compared to patients with other CTDs. In addition, the comprehensive nature of AVISE® CTD enables testing for a series of biomarkers in one convenient blood draw to further aid in the differential diagnosis of a wide variety of CTDs and other diseases which can be challenging to diagnose as a result of overlapping symptoms. These diseases include SLE, RA, Sjögren’s syndrome, APS, other autoimmune-related diseases such as autoimmune thyroid, and other disorders that mimic these diseases, such as fibromyalgia. Our test’s ability to allow rheumatologists to effectively rule out SLE and differentially diagnose other CTDs such as RA adds clarity to the rheumatologist’s assessment, thereby making the larger diagnostic process more efficient and accurate. The clinical performance of our proprietary biomarkers and the convenience of a single blood draw make AVISE® CTD an attractive choice among rheumatologists.
AVISE® Lupus 
The AVISE® Lupus test employs CB-CAPs technology and is the cornerstone of the SLE assessment within our more comprehensive AVISE® CTD testing product. AVISE® Lupus measures activation of the complement system by quantifying the level of BC4d and EC4d in the patient’s blood. Rheumatologists choose to order the comprehensive AVISE® CTD test or the more focused AVISE® Lupus test based on medical necessity, which is determined by each patient’s symptoms and medical history. 
AVISE® APS 
AVISE® APS consists of a specialized panel of autoantibody tests. This test aids in both the diagnosis and management of APS, a hyper-coagulation state leading to thrombosis, pregnancy complications and even death. Rheumatologists would typically request the AVISE® APS test in patients who initially tested positive for one or more APS biomarkers contained in AVISE® CTD, or in the management of patients experiencing a high-risk pregnancy.
AVISE® Vasculitis AAV 
In September 2020, we launched AVISE® Vasculitis AAV which utilizes a testing panel of individual analytes designed to provide physicians with rapid and reliable results in the assessment and monitoring of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV). AAV is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by vascular inflammation and damage. Early signs and symptoms vary greatly and are not always indicative of the severity of the disease. Rapid and accurate testing is essential to prevent death and long-term disability. 
Prognosis 
AVISE® SLE Prognostic 
AVISE® SLE Prognostic is a panel of autoantibodies that have established predictive value for assessing the potential for complications affecting the kidney, brain and cardiovascular system, including lupus nephritis, lupus psychosis, strokes and heart attacks related to lupus. Rheumatologists rely on insights from the AVISE® SLE Prognostic test to help tailor their treatment approach. 
AVISE® Anti-CarP 
AVISE® Anti-CarP, which measures anti-CarP, was developed by the Leiden University Medical Center, and we introduced it as a biomarker-driven RA prognostic test through a distribution agreement with Werfen USA, LLC. with the goal of identifying patients prone to more severe disease. We were the first commercial laboratory to make testing for anti-CarP available in the United States with the introduction of AVISE® Anti-CarP in 2018. This test uniquely addresses two major challenges facing rheumatologists today – (1) patients presenting with RA symptoms but lacking the common confirmatory blood tests for anti-RF or anti-CCP, known as sero-negative patients, and (2) the lack of a serologic indicator, which indicates a poor prognosis and helps guide treatment decisions. Anti-CarP can be positive in up to 26% of RA patients who are negative for anti-CCP. Furthermore, RA patients positive for Anti-CarP have an increased risk for more severe RA disease, including permanent joint damage.
AVISE® PC4d 
AVISE® PC4d, introduced in 2018, reflects over 10 years of research efforts and employs CB-CAPs technology. This CB-CAP biomarker measures platelet-bound C4d (PC4d), and has been shown in clinical studies to have significant association with thrombosis and ischemic stroke in SLE. These thrombotic events can be among the most damaging and deadly forms of lupus flares and often strike without warning. Because of its strong association with thrombosis, we believe AVISE® PC4d promises to be a valuable tool for SLE disease monitoring. 
Monitoring 
AVISE® SLE Monitor
AVISE® SLE Monitor is a blood test that employs CB-CAPs technology and is intended to assess the condition of a patient that has been diagnosed with SLE. It offers a unique combination of biomarkers that measure for EC4d, which has shown greater accuracy in tracking disease activity than C3 and C4, and PC4d, which is associated with thrombosis risk in SLE. AVISE® SLE Monitor offers additional insight into a patient’s disease activity as well as possible adverse events. Rheumatologists have limited methods for evaluating the extent of disease activity taking place inside the body of an SLE patient. They rely on imperfect biomarkers, overt symptoms or flares and patient reported history, all of which leave the rheumatologists looking for greater insights. In surveys conducted with SLE patients, it has been reported that patients tend to under report their symptoms and many healthcare providers are unaware of this bias. AVISE® SLE Monitor demonstrates correlation to SLE disease activity and is therefore designed to enable rheumatologists to effectively assess and optimize therapeutic intervention in patients diagnosed with SLE. Additionally, AVISE® SLE Monitor measures EC4d, anti-C1q, C3, C4 and anti-dsDNA which can assist physicians with managing their lupus nephritis patients. Depending on disease severity, our AVISE® SLE Monitor testing product may be utilized by patients multiple times a year and throughout their lives. We believe AVISE® SLE Monitor will play an increasingly important role in the management of SLE patients and further solidify the role and relationship of AVISE® testing products for these patients. 
AVISE® MTX 
AVISE® MTX is a patented and validated blood test that precisely measures blood levels of MTXPG, the active metabolite of methotrexate linked to disease control in RA patients. There is large variability in the way patients absorb and metabolize methotrexate, leaving rheumatologists unsure of what steps to take when a patient has an inadequate response. Methotrexate is the most widely prescribed drug by rheumatologists in the treatment of RA. Measuring MTXPGs allows rheumatologists to identify patients presenting with inadequate exposure to methotrexate enabling them to optimize dosing and achieve therapeutic levels commensurate with adequate disease control. When faced with a patient who is not responding to methotrexate therapy, the options include increasing the dose, switching to a parenteral delivery method and/or advancing to a more costly biologic therapy. AVISE® MTX provides crucial information as to whether a patient has achieved MTXPG blood levels consistent with an appropriate response to methotrexate, also known as the therapeutic level, or if the MTXPG blood levels are too low to produce adequate effects. AVISE® MTX can allow rheumatologists to make more informed therapeutic decisions in their efforts to optimize methotrexate therapy and give patients their best chance at achieving an optimal response. 
AVISE® HCQ 
AVISE® HCQ is a blood test designed to help rheumatologists objectively monitor levels of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in whole blood as they treat patients with SLE and other CTDs, including RA. HCQ is typically prescribed to patients to control SLE disease activity and prevent flares. However, there is large variability in the response to HCQ therapy, the drug can sometimes take weeks or months to have a therapeutic effect and compliance has been documented to be an issue in CTD patients. We believe measuring HCQ makes the patient accountable, and also 
helps to determine whether HCQ blood levels are adequate and consistent with clinical efficacy. The addition of new and costly biologic therapies approved for the treatment of SLE may drive interest by all healthcare stakeholders, especially payors, to adopt an approach that optimizes a generic drug before advancing to a costlier alternative. 
Test Reports
We provide the results of our AVISE® testing products in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand test report typically sent to rheumatologists within five business days following receipt of the blood specimen. As shown below, the result of the AVISE® Lupus portion of the AVISE® CTD report displays a gradient illustrating the likelihood of the presence of lupus, which facilitates interpretation and discussion of the result with the patient versus only reporting a numerical value. In addition, all biomarker results for AVISE® CTD are reported and organized by disease state, providing clarity and convenience for the rheumatologists. A sample of the full AVISE® CTD report is shown below: 
AVISE® CTD Report 
Our Pipeline and Growth Opportunities 
We regularly confer with national experts in the clinical management of rheumatic autoimmune diseases, including RA and lupus, to help guide the organization’s leadership team on the design and execution of research projects, as well as weigh-in on known and anticipated advances in technologies affecting clinical management of autoimmune diseases. We believe there is significant potential to capitalize on our proprietary technologies by integrating with commercially validated biomarkers to develop testing products with superior clinical utility. The complement pathway is widely implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection. We believe that CB-CAPs technology, owing to its stability and reliability, will allow us to produce meaningful and differentiated proprietary solutions for rheumatologists. For example, we are developing assays that we believe may have high diagnostic, prognostic, monitoring and/or therapeutic response value in patients with Lupus, RA and additional autoimmune indications. 
AVISE® RADR Platform
RA is estimated to affect approximately 1.5 million patients in the United States and can be difficult to manage due to a well-defined treatment response ceiling for the spectrum of FDA-approved biological treatments for RA. Personalized therapeutic agent selection for RA patients remains a significant unmet need. RA patients often try multiple therapies empirically before they find one that lowers their disease activity. The placement of an RA patient on an ineffective therapy risks progression and worsening of the disease, further damage to the joints, and significant wasted spend on expensive therapeutic agents. There are currently no reliable assays for predicting positive patient response prior to the selection of commonly prescribed biological therapeutic agents. In collaboration with Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), we are aiming to develop a family of patented assays pertaining to RNA expression patterns used in the prediction of patient response to biological therapeutics for RA. The assays utilize minimally invasive synovial tissue biopsies as input, which are then processed for total RNA expression data. The resulting data is then run through proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) developed algorithms that provide actionable insights on predicted biological therapeutic response for RA patients based on an individual patient's RNA expression patterns.
AVISE® SLE Monitor (2.0)
SLE is characterized by a chronic, systemic inflammatory burden, and disease progression is defined by the accumulation of irreversible organ damage typically resulting from chronic inflammation and/or chronic corticosteroid use. Among the challenges for rheumatologists responsible for the care of lupus patients is the unpredictability of the disease course defined by periods of waxing and waning episodes of inflammation. The unpredictable nature of SLE and the lack of reliable conventional biomarkers indicative of present and near-term disease activity results in a significant unmet need for a surrogate method to monitor disease activity. Our goal is to leverage clinical and laboratory data collected across multiple longitudinal SLE cohorts to identify a set of biomarkers that can inform an AI-developed algorithm aimed at guiding ongoing treatment decisions throughout the course of a lupus patient’s journey.
AVISE® Lupus Nephritis
Lupus nephritis (LN) is an autoimmune disease and a frequent complication in people who have SLE. It causes the immune system to produce proteins called autoantibodies that attack the body's own tissues and organs, including the kidneys. If left untreated, LN can lead to significant health problems, permanent kidney damage and even death. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to managing LN and to preventing it from escalating. Although early onset of LN is not typically noticeable by patients, nearly 40% of SLE patients go on to develop LN. Currently, urinary protein to creatine ratio measurement is the standard means of assessing kidney damage; however, it is not necessarily indicative of kidney prognosis or treatment response. We aim to develop a test for detecting protein analytes in urine that can aid rheumatologists in the ongoing management and risk stratification of patients suffering from lupus nephritis.
Sales and Marketing 
Our specialized sales force is focused on targeting the approximately 4,500 rheumatologists across the United States. Our sales representatives generally have extensive experience in healthcare sales with backgrounds in rheumatology, diagnostics and/or pharmaceutical sales. In addition, our sales representatives complete a comprehensive disease-level sales training program and are required to participate in regular, ongoing training activities and certifications. 
Our goal is for our sales representative to be viewed as a collaborative resource to the rheumatologists and their practice. 
Our field-based sales force is organized into 40 territories within the following four regions: West, Central, Northeast and Southeast. Our inside sales force helps further our brand awareness with, and access to, rheumatologists located in rural and outlying areas of the United States. We intend to continue to evaluate our sales force's reach and frequency of interactions with rheumatologists, including as we launch our pipeline products. To further support our promotional efforts, we have a centralized, dedicated client services department with a high level of technical training that augments our specialized sales force and marketing activities. This group enhances sales efficiency and customer satisfaction by providing personalized customer support.
Adoption and Growth through Quality Testing and Service 
Our focus on quality allows for a dedicated sales approach which entails a commitment to understanding the needs of both provider and patient. Through raising awareness of the benefits AVISE® testing provides, our sales team is able to deliver quality testing and support services to providers, and ultimately, their patients. To ensure our marketing and sales efforts are reaching those that we believe could benefit most from AVISE®, we emphasize execution in three core areas: targeting, messaging and call frequency. We strategically target the highest-potential practices by utilizing various data sources (e.g., market analytics, demographic data, historical therapeutic usage and diagnostic product trends). Furthermore, we believe the increased access afforded by our testing products will allow for patient-focused messaging and the increased accuracy of our testing products over current standard of care diagnostic methodologies. Finally, we execute a high-frequency promotional strategy for our top-targeted rheumatologists and their office personnel to build knowledge, understanding and retention of the benefits of our testing products. 
We plan to leverage core channels for building awareness and adoption, including our participation with multiple patient advocacy organizations and medical societies, such as the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). We have also established strong relationships with multiple rheumatology care management organizations (Super Groups), which can be key in influencing favorable reimbursement. Our AVISE® MTX testing product has been included in the clinical guidelines for two of these groups. We believe our experience with advancing a testing product from initial development through clinical adoption differentiates us and uniquely positions us to replicate success with our other testing products. Beyond working with these Super Groups, we intend to continue to augment field selling activity with a balanced marketing mix, including print and digital advertising, direct marketing, continuing medical education programs and working with key opinion leaders to support peer-to-peer educational events.
Reimbursement, Clinical Validation and Clinical Utility 
Reimbursement 
The primary source of revenue for our products is reimbursement from third-party payors and client bill arrangements. Third-party payors include government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors, such as insurance companies. Achieving and maintaining broad coverage and reimbursement of our current products by third-party payors, including Medicare, are key components that contribute to our revenue and financial results. Expanding coverage by government and commercial payors for our commercialized and pipeline tests is and will be important for our future growth. 
We are actively engaged in efforts to achieve broad commercial coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products, followed by contracting with commercial payors. Achieving positive coverage reduces the need for appeals and reduces failures to collect from the patient’s insurance. Additionally, achieving in-network contracts with commercial payors can shorten the time required to receive payments. Our approach to commercial payment is centered on impacting our standing in clinical guidelines and individual payor medical policies. We seek to accomplish this through continued evidence development and publication, medical director engagement and individual claim-based appeal efforts, detailed as follows: 
▪Meet the evidence standards necessary to be consistent with leading clinical guidelines. We believe inclusion in leading clinical guidelines plays a critical role in payors’ coverage decisions. In order to change clinical guidelines, tests must carry a high level of published evidence demonstrating analytical validity, clinical validity, clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. When studies with such evidence are published in peer-reviewed journals, the authors of clinical guidelines may assess the level of evidence and determine whether modifying existing guidelines to include new technology is warranted.
▪Execute an internal managed care policy and claims adjudication function as part of our core business operations. We employ a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who work with patients and payors to obtain maximum reimbursement. In parallel, a managed care team collaborates with our reimbursement specialists to ensure our payor outreach strategy reacts to and anticipates the changing 
needs of our customer base. Overall, we work to address payors at the national level in addition to high claim volume regional payors we have identified based on our current territory coverage.
▪Cultivate a network of key opinion leaders. Key opinion leaders are able to influence clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into clinical guidelines. We collaborate with key opinion leaders early in the development process to ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our testing products to healthcare providers and payors.
While we have contracts for reimbursement with a limited number of commercial payors, we are actively pursuing additional commercial payor contracts. When we contract to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements are made pursuant to a percentage of our charges or a negotiated fee schedule amount. Where we are not reimbursed in full, or receive a claim denial, for in-network and out-of-network claims, we may elect to appeal the insurer’s underpayment or denial of payment or seek payment from the patient.
Clinical Validation 
We demonstrated the clinical validity of AVISE® Lupus in a study of 794 patients conducted from 2010 to 2014 across multiple leading academic centers. The primary endpoint of the study was the specificity and sensitivity of AVISE® Lupus compared to common autoantibodies used to diagnose SLE and other CTDs, such as ANA and anti-dsDNA. The final results of this study showed that AVISE® Lupus demonstrated 86% specificity and 80% sensitivity in distinguishing SLE from other CTDs and fibromyalgia, was 33% more specific than ANA (53% specificity/89% sensitivity) and was 48% more sensitive than anti-dsDNA (32% sensitivity/97% specificity). 
We further demonstrated the clinical validity of AVISE® Lupus for detection of probable SLE (pSLE) in a 246 subject multi-center, prospective, cross-sectional study, first published in the Arthritis & Rheumatology Journal in September 2019. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of AVISE® Lupus and CB-CAPs as a marker of complement activation in patients with pSLE and the usefulness of the AVISE® Lupus test as a predictor of the evolution of pSLE into classified SLE by the ACR criteria. Of the 92 pSLE patients, more pSLE were positive for CB-CAPs (28%) or AVISE® Lupus (40%) than for low complement (9%) at the enrollment visit (p=0.0001, for each) and an AVISE® Lupus index score >0.08 prospectively associated with the development from pSLE to SLE by ACR classification criteria within 18 months (hazard ratio = 3.11, p<0.01).
Clinical Utility 
We have collaborated with both academic and community clinicians to demonstrate the clinical utility of AVISE® Lupus versus standard diagnostic tests in physician diagnosis, impact on patient management decisions, patient reported outcomes and health economics. 
We sponsored a longitudinal, case-control, retrospective review of medical charts in 2016 to assess the value and clinical utility of AVISE® Lupus to rheumatologists. The results of this study were published in the Open Rheumatology Journal in 2016 and suggested that a positive AVISE® Lupus test aids in the diagnosis of SLE versus standard diagnostic tests. 
In early 2018, we initiated CARE for Lupus, a prospective, randomized, multi-site study to assess the performance of AVISE® Lupus versus standard diagnostic laboratory tests (SDLT). A total of 145 patients were enrolled across 32 sites between July 2017 and December 2018, with 73 patients enrolled in the SDLT group and 72 patients in the AVISE® Lupus group. The CARE study was published in September 2019 in Lupus Science & Medicine. Results showed among patients who tested positive for AVISE® Lupus (n=9), 44% in the AVISE® Lupus group had a higher likelihood of SLE, compared with 9% in the SDLT group (p=0.127), whereas among patients who tested negative for AVISE® Lupus (n=63), 60% in the AVISE® Lupus group had a lower likelihood of SLE, compared with 37% in the SDLT group (p=0.012). In the group of patients randomized to the AVISE® Lupus group, positive test results associated significantly with initiation of prednisone (p=0.03) and a similar trend was observed with HCQ therapy (p=0.11). Finally, in the group of patients randomized to the AVISE® Lupus group, a positive test result associated with an increase in patient-reported outcomes measuring health-related quality of life using five-level EQ-5D (EQ5D-5L index score) from enrollment to visit 2 (p=0.028), and greater improvements were detectable when compared to the group of patients positive for AVISE® Lupus and randomized to the SDLT arm (p=0.049).
In July 2021, a real-world retrospective analysis of patients tested with the AVISE® Lupus test was published in the journal Lupus Science & Medicine, titled "A multianalyte assay panel with cell-bound complement activation products demonstrates clinical utility in systemic lupus erythematosus clinical utility study summary." A cohort of 161 AVISE® Lupus tested patients from 12 rheumatology centers across the United States provided clinical outcome data on diagnosis and treatment decisions following AVISE® Lupus testing. The study findings revealed a 7 to 15-
fold increased risk of Lupus diagnosis in AVISE® Lupus Positive and anti-dsDNA negative patients relative to patients negative for both tests. In addition, AVISE® Lupus positive and anti-dsDNA negative patients were at 3 to 4-fold increased odds relative to patients testing negative for both tests of starting a new hydroxychloroquine (cornerstone therapy for Lupus) prescription following AVISE® Lupus testing. Collectively, the study results affirm earlier study findings demonstrating the superior clinical utility and actionability of AVISE® Lupus vs. standard diagnostic testing for the differential diagnosis of Lupus. 
In July 2022, we announced new, real-world evidence illustrating that AVISE® testing can enable decisive clinical action in the differential diagnosis of lupus. The "Complement Activation Products vs Standard ANA Testing: Treatment Outcomes, Diagnosis, and Economic Impact in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus" (CAPSTONE) study was the largest comparative utility study in lupus diagnostics and was published in the Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy. The study leveraged multiple databases encompassing electronic health records and linked insurance claims data on nearly 50,000 patients tested with AVISE® or standard of care labs from hundreds of rheumatologists across the United States, comparing diagnosis, treatment and cost of care outcomes for new patients tested with AVISE® Lupus and those tested with a traditional ANA (tANA) approach, including specific autoantibodies. The CAPSTONE study supports that the AVISE® Lupus test is more clinically effective, both for patients who test positive and those who test negative, as compared to the current standard of care. Important key findings of the CAPSTONE study included, among other things, a: (i) 2x decrease in diagnostic testing costs in the first six-month follow-up period for AVISE® Lupus [-] vs. tANA[-]; (ii) 3.5x less frequent repeat testing overall when using AVISE® Lupus vs. tANA; (iii) 6x increased odds of establishing a new SLE diagnosis with AVISE® Lupus [+] vs. tANA[+]; and (iv) 3x increased odds of initiating one or more SLE treatments with AVISE® Lupus [+] vs. tANA[+]. The CAPSTONE study exemplifies the advantages of the AVISE® Lupus test for patients, providers and payors. Delayed diagnosis leads to increased disease burden and diminished quality of life for the patient relative to the current standard of care. By receiving conclusive results, providers are able to initiate treatment early, reducing the need for more aggressive approaches down the road that can lead to irreversible consequences for the patient. Additionally, a conclusive negative test allows providers to lower the number of repeat tests and follow-up visits which is a critical step for achieving diagnostic clarity for the patient.
Healthcare Economics
In October 2020, a study in collaboration with leading health economic experts was published in the journal ACR Open Rheumatology, titled "Evaluation of the Economic Benefit of Earlier Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Diagnosis using a Multivariate Assay Panel (MAP)." This was the first ever evaluation of the economics of diagnosing SLE with AVISE® Lupus (MAP) compared to standard diagnostic laboratory tests in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 suspected SLE patients. Over the four-year time horizon, AVISE® Lupus demonstrated an estimated total direct cost savings of approximately $2.0 million ($1,991 per patient). In addition, the year one savings was $0.7 million ($655 per eligible patient), with the use of AVISE® Lupus, which aligns with early benefit to health plans looking for savings in the first year. 
Laboratory Operations 
We perform all of our AVISE® tests in our approximately 13,000 square foot laboratory located in Vista, California. Our laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). Our laboratory is certified for performance of high-complexity testing by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in accordance with CLIA and is licensed by California and all states requiring out-of-state licensure, including the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). Our clinical laboratory typically reports AVISE® testing product results within five business days. 
We believe that our existing laboratory facility is adequate to meet our business needs for at least the next 12 months and that additional laboratory space will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if required.
Quality Assurance 
Our quality assurance function oversees the quality of our laboratory operations. We have established oversight for systems implementation and maintenance procedures, document control processes, supplier qualification, preventive or corrective actions and employee training processes that we believe achieves excellence in operations. We continuously monitor and improve our processes and procedures and believe this high-quality service leads to customer satisfaction and retention.
Competition 
Our principal competition for our AVISE® testing products is traditional methods used by healthcare providers to test patients with CTD-like symptoms. Such traditional methods include testing for a broad range of diagnostic, 
immunology and chemistry biomarkers, such as ANA and anti-dsDNA, and serum complement biomarkers, such as C3 and C4. We also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, ARUP Laboratories, Inc. and the Mayo Clinic, all of which have existing infrastructures to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. Large, multispecialty group medical clinics, health systems and academic medical university-based clinics may provide in-house clinical laboratories offering autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease testing services. Additionally, we compete against regional clinical laboratories providing testing in the autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease field, including Rheumatology Diagnostics Laboratories, Inc. (acquired by Laboratory Corporation of America in June 2020). Other potential competitors include companies that might develop diagnostic or disease or drug monitoring products, such as Progentec Diagnostics Inc., Scipher Medicine Corporation, Genalyte Inc., Oncimmune plc, DxTerity Diagnostics Inc., AMPEL BioSolutions, and Immunovia AB. In the future, we may also face competition from companies developing new products or technologies. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our target market include: quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data; confidence in diagnostic results; sales and marketing capabilities; the extent of reimbursement; inclusion in clinical guidelines; cost-effectiveness; and ease of use. We rely upon independent sources for phlebotomy to obtain patient samples; interruptions to this capability could dramatically impact patient access to our tests.
Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources; in addition to greater selling and marketing capabilities. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours or have preferred network status that could be viewed by rheumatologists and payors as functionally equivalent to our solution or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration. This could force us to lower the list price of our products and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability. 
Agreements with Pharmaceutical Companies 
Collaboration Agreement with GSK 
In January 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with GSK, pursuant to which we provided GSK with our test result data to provide market insight into and help increase awareness on the benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis of SLE. The agreement was amended in November 2018 to, among other things, include data from our AVISE® Prognostic and AVISE® HCQ testing products and extend the term of the agreement through December 31, 2019. The agreement was further amended in November 2019, November 2020, December 2021 and February 2022.
Under the agreement, we were required to deliver weekly de-identified data files to GSK covering all data obtained from the performance of certain AVISE® testing products, subject to applicable requirements under the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) internal policy requirements and other applicable laws. During the term of the agreement and amendments through December 31, 2021, the data we provided to GSK could not be provided, directly or through a third party, to any other pharmaceutical company that was marketing or developing a product for the treatment of SLE, however, the February 2022 amendment eliminated that limitation. GSK made a single upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive the applicable data files. In addition, GSK agreed to create a joint steering committee to cooperate with us in order to raise awareness and physician support for our AVISE® testing products, including through the development and delivery of approved promotional materials and the implementation of a related training plan for each party’s sales personnel. 
This agreement was terminated, effective January 1, 2023. 
Intellectual Property Overview 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our testing products and services and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, to defend and enforce our patents, to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological 
innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our testing products and services. 
We are the owner or licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets which protect various aspects of our business. The patent families comprising our patent portfolio are primarily focused on our AVISE® testing products for the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, and are generally directed to CB-CAPs, red blood cell MTXPG exposure assessments and anti-MCV antibodies. We intend to leverage the intellectual property surrounding our AVISE® testing products as an important component of our business strategy. 
Patent Protection for our AVISE® Testing Products 
Our portfolio of patents and patent applications related to our AVISE® testing products generally relates to three aspects: CB-CAPs, red blood cell MTXPG exposure assessments and anti-MCV antibodies. The patent families which we believe are important for the protection of AVISE® are summarized below in the section entitled “License Agreements.” As of February 22, 2023, our portfolio primarily consisted of the following:
CB-CAPs 
We are the exclusive licensee of five patent families related to CB-CAPs technology from the University of Pittsburgh (UPitt). We expect that these patent families (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,361,517, 7,390,631, 7,585,640, 7,588,905, 8,080,382, and 8,126,654) will expire in 2024 or 2025. A foreign patent corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 7,361,517 has issued in Europe (EP 1,756,571).

While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
License Agreements 
Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh 
In August 2011, we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement with UPitt, to amend and restate the exclusive license agreement we obtained by our purchase of the medical diagnostics division of Cypress Bioscience, Inc. (Cypress) in 2010 (the Cypress Purchase) and to obtain an exclusive license to UPitt’s patent rights in certain inventions (the UPitt Patent Rights) related to the use of CB-CAPs technology in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, including certain patents related to our AVISE® testing products. The agreement was amended three times, once in May 2012 to, among other things, limit the territory of the license to the United States and exclude certain foreign patents and applications from the agreement, once in September 2013 to add (1) an 
additional U.S. patent to the UPitt Patent Rights licensed under the agreement and (2) the field of monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection to the scope of the license, and once in June 2016 to, among other things, clarify the definition of combination products for determining royalties due under the license. 
Under the agreement, we are permitted to make, use and sell products and services utilizing the UPitt Patent Rights in the field of SLE and the field of monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection and to sublicense such rights. UPitt retained the right to practice under the UPitt Patent Rights and to use such rights for non-commercial education and research purposes. In addition, this agreement is subject to the rights of the U.S. government, if any, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §200, et seq. Pursuant to this law, the U.S. government may have acquired a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. government the inventions described in the UPitt Patent Rights throughout the world. 
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we made certain upfront payments to UPitt on the first and second anniversaries of the agreement that increased on the third and subsequent anniversaries of the agreement until the first sale of products or services utilizing the UPitt Patent Rights. We are required to pay UPitt a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products or services utilizing the UPitt Patent Rights sold by us or our affiliates, subject to minimum annual royalty payments and other adjustment in certain circumstances. We also made a $0.2 million milestone payment to UPitt with the achievement of certain levels of net sales which we met in 2014. Our royalty obligations continue for each licensed product or service on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product or service in such country. 
In the event we sublicense any of the UPitt Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay UPitt a low single-digit percentage sublicense royalty on net sales of products or services sold by our sublicensees that utilize the sublicensed UPitt Patent Rights and a low double-digit percentage of all non-royalty sublicensing income received by us.
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the UPitt Patent Rights, and we have agreed to meet certain development and commercial milestones. UPitt may terminate the agreement if we fail to meet such milestones. In addition, if we fail to meet a milestone relating to development of the UPitt Patent Rights in the monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection field, UPitt may remove that field from our licensed rights. We are currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. 
We may terminate the agreement upon six months’ written notice to UPitt. UPitt may terminate the agreement in the event of our nonperformance of any of our obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a certain period of time following our receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of our insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the UPitt Patent Rights. 
Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh 
We made an economic decision to cease the maintenance and licensing of UPitt Patent Rights outside the United States, which led to such rights returning to UPitt. We subsequently made the determination to re-license these foreign patent rights from UPitt, but at the time of re-licensing these patent rights, a number of the foreign patent rights had permanently lapsed. Accordingly, in September 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with UPitt to obtain an exclusive license to UPitt’s remaining ex-U.S. patent rights in certain inventions (the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights) related to the use of CB-CAPs technology in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, including certain patents related to our AVISE® testing products. 
Under the agreement, we are permitted to make, use and sell products and services utilizing the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights in the field of SLE and the field of monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection outside of the United States, and to sublicense such rights. UPitt retained the right to practice under the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights and to use such rights for non-commercial education and research purposes. In addition, this agreement is subject to the rights of the U.S. government, if any, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §200, et seq. 
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid an initial license fee to UPitt. We are also required to pay UPitt a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products or services utilizing the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights sold by us or our affiliates, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Our royalty obligations continue for each licensed product or service on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product or service in such country. 
In the event we sublicense any of the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay UPitt a low single-digit percentage sublicense royalty on net sales of products or services sold by our sublicensees that utilize the 
sublicensed ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights and a low double-digit percentage of all non-royalty sublicensing income received by us. 
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights, and we have agreed to meet certain commercial milestones. UPitt may terminate the agreement if we fail to meet such milestones. We are currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. 
We may terminate the agreement upon six months’ written notice to UPitt. UPitt may terminate the agreement in the event of our nonperformance of any of our obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a certain period of time following our receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of our insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the UPitt Patent Rights.
Asset Purchase Agreement with Cypress (Royalty Pharma) and Proprius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In October 2010, we completed the Cypress Purchase pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Cypress and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Proprius Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which we obtained certain assets related to our AVISE® testing products and services. In 2011, Royalty Pharma Collection Trust (Royalty Pharma), acquired Cypress and became its successor-in-interest under the agreement. In consideration for the acquisition, we made certain initial cash payments to Cypress and we are currently making payments to Royalty Pharma, as a successor-in-interest to Cypress, pursuant to the August 2012 amendment, which payments are subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. Under our agreements with Royalty Pharma, we are required to pay Royalty Pharma a low double-digit royalty on the world-wide net sales of CB-CAPs products and a low double-digit royalty on the net sales of certain new products in each case, for a period of eight years, which eight-year period expired in January 2020. 
In addition, we are required to make certain one-time contingent milestone payments for two third-party commercial programs, for the launch of a CB-CAPs monitoring assay, and for the achievement of an annual, worldwide net sales level for CB-CAPs products. Our agreement with Royalty Pharma requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the milestones to be achieved. In December 2015, we achieved the specified annual world-wide net sales of CB-CAPs products which required us to make a $2.0 million milestone payment to Royalty Pharma. We paid the applicable $2.0 million milestone payment in 2016. In February 2017, we amended our agreements with Royalty Pharma relating to the launch of a monitoring product using CB-CAPs technology. As a result of this amendment, a prior obligation to make a one-time payment of $1.0 million upon the launch of a monitoring product incorporating CB-CAPs technology was replaced with an agreement to pay Royalty Pharma a one-time payment of $100,000 upon the launch of such a product, plus a 2.5% royalty based on future cash collections from sales of that product which incorporate the licensed technology. Future royalties under this arrangement are limited to the lesser of $1,200,000 (including the upfront payment of $100,000) or the total royalty earned through January 1, 2024. 
Exclusive License Agreement and Master Research Collaboration Agreement with Allegheny Health Network Research Institute 
In May 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Allegheny Health Network Research Institute (AHN), under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to AHN's patent rights in certain inventions (the AHN Patent Rights) related to diagnostics for autoimmune rheumatic diseases.
Under the agreement, we are permitted to make, use and sell products and services utilizing the AHN Patent Rights and to sublicense such rights; provided, however, that any such sublicenses may only be granted with AHN's consent. AHN retained the right to practice under the AHN Patent Rights and to use such rights for teaching, research, education, public service, clinical and other research-related purposes. In addition, the agreement is subject to the rights of the U.S. government with respect to the AHN Patent Rights, including under a funding agreement between AHN and the U.S. government and under the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. §200, et seq.). Pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act, the U.S. government may acquire a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. government the inventions described in the AHN Patent Rights throughout the world.
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid an initial license fee to AHN to cover past patent expenses and agreed to pay future direct patent costs related to AHN Patent Rights. We are also required to pay AHN a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products utilizing the AHN Patent Rights through the first quarter of 2024 sold by us or our affiliates, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we are required to pay AHN an increased low single-digit royalty or a flat annual minimum royalty amount, which royalty obligations continue for each licensed product on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product in such country, pending approvals and 
commercialization, or the earlier termination of the agreement (excluding payment obligations accruing prior to such termination).
In the event we sublicense any of the AHN Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay AHN a mid-double-digit percentage of any sublicense income, whether in the form of royalties or sub-license fees.
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the AHN Patent Rights. If, no earlier than May 2023, we elect not to pursue intellectual property rights or expand commercialization to certain territories within a commercially reasonable period, AHN may pursue other licenses and terminate our exclusive license with respect to such territories upon 30 days prior written notice.
We may terminate the agreement upon 60 day written notice to AHN provided we pay a specified termination fee. AHN may terminate the agreement in the event of our nonperformance of any of our material obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a certain period of time following our receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the AHN Patent Rights.
In addition, we entered into a master research collaboration agreement with AHN, focused on the development of novel patented biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. The agreement has a three-year initial term, expiring May 2024, with renewals thereafter for successive one-year terms upon mutual agreement with AHN. Each party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days' notice to the other party. We are required to pay AHN a collaboration fee of $0.4 million for each year of the agreement and AHN is required to make an in-kind contribution equivalent of $0.3 million for the initial term and each subsequent one-year term, if any.
Exclusive License Agreement and Collaboration Agreement with Queen Mary University of London 
In November 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with QMUL, under which we obtained an exclusive license to QMUL's patent-pending inventions (the QMUL Patent Rights), related to diagnosis and/or development of diagnostic or companion diagnostics for rheumatoid arthritis.
Under the agreement, we are permitted to make, use and sell products and services utilizing the QMUL Patent Rights and to sublicense such rights; provided, however, that any such sublicenses may only be granted with QMUL's consent. QMUL retained the right to practice under the QMUL Patent Rights and to use such rights for teaching, research, education, public service, clinical and other research-related purposes. 
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid an initial license fee to QMUL and payment of past patent expenses and ongoing patent expenses. We are required to make a $0.1 million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of products utilizing the QMUL Patent Rights. In addition, after the first 18 months of commercial sales under the terms of the exclusive license agreement, we are required to pay royalties in the low to high single-digits on net sales of testing products using the assigned patents, pending approvals and commercialization.
In the event we sublicense any of the QMUL Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay QMUL a double-digit percentage of sublicensing income, whether in the form of royalties or sub-license fees.
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the QMUL Patent Rights. QMUL may terminate the agreement if we fail to develop the QMUL Patent Rights in the field of diagnosis and/or development of diagnostic or companion diagnostics for rheumatoid arthritis, QMUL may convert our license to non-exclusive.
We may terminate the agreement upon six month written notice to QMUL. QMUL may terminate the agreement in the event of our nonperformance of any of our material obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a certain period of time following our receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue for a period of 20 years after the first commercial sale of any licensed product utilizing the QMUL Patent Rights.
In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with QMUL for a three-year term, expiring November 2024. The collaboration will focus on development and optimization of patent-pending precision medicine approaches, based on RNA expression signatures, to personalize therapeutic agent selection for RA patients. We or QMUL may terminate the master research collaboration agreement upon 30-day written notice.
Regulations 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 
As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under CLIA, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations, including test processes, personnel, facilities administration, equipment maintenance, recordkeeping, quality systems and proficiency testing. We must maintain CLIA certification to be eligible to bill for diagnostic services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Many commercial third-party payors also require CLIA certification as a condition of payment. 
Our Vista facility holds a current CLIA certificate. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. We elect to participate in the accreditation program of CAP. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of inspection by CMS for CAP-accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time, and any such changes could have a material effect on our business. 
Penalties for non-compliance with CLIA or CAP requirements include suspension, limitation or revocation of the laboratory’s CLIA or CAP certificate, as well as a directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties, as applicable. 
State Laboratory Licensing 
Our Vista facility also holds a state license issued by the California Department of Public Health (DPH). California law and regulations establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of laboratory personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws and regulations also mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory for quality control purposes. 
Because we receive specimens from New York, our Vista facility is also required to be licensed by the NYDOH New York laws and regulations establish standards in a variety of operational areas, including:
▪day-to-day operation of the laboratory, including training and skill levels required of laboratory personnel;
▪physical requirements of a facility;
▪equipment; and
▪validation and quality control.
New York law also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York state law, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in or outside of New York. If a laboratory is out of compliance with New York's statutory or regulatory standards, the NYDOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory’s New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory’s operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. New York's law and regulations are more stringent than CLIA in certain respects. For example, NYDOH must approve a laboratory developed test (LDT) before it is offered in New York. We have received written approval from NYDOH to offer our products in New York.
In addition to New York and California, other states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. 
Federal Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests and Certain Devices
The laws and regulations governing the marketing of diagnostic products are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. We perform our tests like AVISE® CTD, AVISE® SLE Prognostic and AVISE® MTX assays in our Vista, California clinical laboratory, and they are primarily regulated under CLIA, as administered by CMS, as well as by applicable state laws, as described above. The FDA regulates any diagnostic tests that meet the definition of a medical device, except under specific, narrow circumstances. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) defines a medical device as "an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or 
other animals and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes." By this definition, in vitro reagents and diagnostic tests are considered medical devices. Specifically, the FDA defines an in vitro diagnostic test (IVD), as "reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae." Therefore, the FDA generally considers diagnostic testing products like ours to be IVDs subject to the agency's regulatory requirements. Among other things, pursuant to the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices, including IVDs, in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. 
The FDCA classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device, are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II. For most Class II devices, a manufacturer must submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low-risk Class II devices are exempted from this requirement. When a 510(k) premarket notification submission is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent" to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. Class II devices may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling. Most Class I devices are exempt from 510(k) premarket notification requirements, but like Class II and III devices, are subject to general controls, such as registration and listing, quality system, labeling, and reporting requirements.
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses; and the medical device reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution.
Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has generally exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable device regulations with respect to IVDs that are designed, manufactured and used within a single high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory for use only in that laboratory. Such tests are referred to as LDTs. We believe that all of our AVISE® test products are LDTs, as are our near-term pipeline candidate tests. As a result, we believe our diagnostic services are currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion and are not subject to the agency's direct oversight or enforcement of device regulations. However, reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. 
Even though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. For several years, members of Congress have been working with stakeholders on a possible bill to regulate in vitro clinical tests including LDTs. Most recently, legislation called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID Act), has been garnering bipartisan and bicameral support. The VALID Act would codify into law the term "in vitro clinical test" (IVCT) to create a new medical product category separate from medical devices that includes products currently regulated as IVDs as well as LDTs. The VALID Act would also create a new system for labs and hospitals to use to submit their tests electronically to the FDA for approval, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time it takes for the agency to approve such tests, and establish a new program to expedite the development of diagnostic tests that can be used to address a current unmet need for patients.
It is unclear whether the VALID Act would be passed by Congress in its current form or signed into law by the President. If the FDA finalizes its position on regulation of LDTs through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, or the VALID Act or other federal legislation is passed reforming the government’s regulation of LDTs, or alternatively, if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT, we could be subject to enforcement of regulatory requirements such as registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting requirements and quality control requirements. Any new legislation or formal FDA regulations affecting LDTs may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. Additionally, if and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or our tests in particular, whether as a result of new legislative authority or following formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a PMA. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes from one to three years or even longer and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to the FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make.
Regulation of Clinical Trials
We have also conducted and may in the future conduct research studies for our AVISE® tests and our other tests in development that involve clinical investigators and human subjects (or stored specimens from human subjects) at sites in the United States. We may need to conduct additional clinical trials for the AVISE® tests, as well as other tests we may offer in the future, to drive test adoption in the marketplace and reimbursement. Should we not be able to perform these studies, or should their results not provide clinically meaningful data and value for clinicians, adoption of our tests could be impaired and we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for them.
The conduct of clinical trials is also subject to extensive federal and institutional regulations intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and welfare of study participants are protected. Most studies involving human participants must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, a duly-constituted institutional review board (IRB), which is a multi-disciplinary committee responsible for reviewing and evaluating the risks and benefits of a clinical trial for participating subjects and monitoring the trial on an ongoing basis. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials and investigators also must comply with, as applicable, regulations, guidelines and IRB requirements for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. The sponsoring company or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, studies involving human subjects often require significant time and cash resources to complete and are subject to a high degree of risk, including risks of experiencing delays, failing to complete the trial or obtaining unexpected or negative results.
Advertising of Laboratory Services or LDTs
Whether regulated by FDA as Class I or Class II devices or not directly subject to FDA’s device requirements as LDTs, advertising for our laboratory services and diagnostic testing products is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar state law restrictions, such as California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act of 1933 (PORA), and other comparable state laws. The Stark Law generally prohibits us from billing Medicare or Medicaid for certain designated health services, including clinical laboratory services, when the physician ordering the service, or any 
member of such physician’s immediate family, has a financial relationship with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. A financial relationship can be a compensation arrangement or an ownership or investment interest.
Sanctions for a Stark Law violation include the following:
▪denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
▪refunds of amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law;
▪significant civil penalties for each bill or claim for a service arising out of the prohibited referral, and additional penalties for each arrangement or scheme that the parties know (or should know) has the principal purpose of circumventing the Stark Law's prohibition;
▪the imposition of penalties of up to three times the amounts assessed for each item or service wrongfully claimed; and
▪possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
The Stark Law applies regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. In addition, violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act, which can result in additional civil penalties. 
Similarly, PORA makes it unlawful for a physician or certain other healing arts licensees to refer a person for certain healthcare services, including clinical laboratory services, if the licensee has a financial interest with the person or entity that receives the referral, unless an exemption is met. Unlike the Stark Law, PORA applies regardless of the source of payment. PORA also prohibits the submission of claims for services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and violation of this prohibition constitutes a public offense and is punishable upon conviction by a fine not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for each violation and appropriate disciplinary action. Other states also have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply, some of which differ from those imposed by the Stark Law or PORA. 
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a clinical laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of, or the recommending or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service that is reimbursable in whole or in part, under any federal healthcare program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Courts have broadly interpreted of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute and generally have held that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals. 
In addition to statutory exceptions to the Anti-Kickback Statute, regulations provide for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor or exception, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, and the parties are immune from prosecution. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. 
Failure to meet the requirements of an exception or the safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances. 
A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment for up to ten years and significant fines for each violation and additional administrative civil money penalties, plus up to three times the amount of the remuneration paid. Convictions under the Anti-Kickback Statute result in mandatory exclusion from federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as the basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act, which is discussed in greater detail below.
Although the Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to items and services reimbursable under any federal healthcare program, a number of states, including California, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute that apply to all third-party payors, including commercial insurers, and, in some states, to patients without insurance. The California Attorney General and courts have interpreted the California anti-kickback and fee-splitting laws in substantially the same way as the courts have interpreted the Anti-Kickback Statute. Penalties under such state laws include imprisonment and significant monetary fines. 
In addition, in October 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA) was enacted as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. EKRA is an all-payor anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. However, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA is not limited to services covered by federal healthcare programs but applies more broadly to services covered by “healthcare benefit programs,” including commercial third-party payors. Although EKRA apparently was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. Further, certain of EKRA’s exceptions are inconsistent with the Anti-Kickback Statute and regulations. EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued.
Other Federal and State Healthcare Laws 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, federal law permits the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services to exclude an individual or entity from Medicare or Medicaid for charging federal healthcare programs, including Medicare or Medicaid, substantially in excess of its usual charges for its items or services absent a finding of good cause. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are subject to varying interpretations. 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, a person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud pursuant to its qui tam provisions. Because the complaint in a qui tam action is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. Regardless of whether the government intervenes in the action, the relator, if successful, will receive a percentage of the recovery. In addition, providers and suppliers must report and return any overpayments received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification, and failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to federal False Claims Act liability. Violation of the federal False Claims Act may result payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant per-claim civil penalties. Several states, including California, have enacted comparable false claims laws that may apply regardless of payor.
The federal civil monetary penalties law (the CMP Law) prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration (including a waiver of copayments and deductible amounts) to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal healthcare program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; (4) billing for medically unnecessary services; and (5) presenting or causing to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The penalties for violating the CMP Law may include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense. 
As noted, a person who offers or provides to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments, co-insurance and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be held liable under the CMP Law. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive amounts owed by federal healthcare program beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. One of the exceptions to the prohibition under the CMP Law covers non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts, and the Anti-Kickback Statute has a safe harbor. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG), has emphasized in guidance documents that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud, may also be implicated for similar practices offered to patients covered by commercial payors. 
Federal criminal statutes prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including those administered by commercial payors, and 
knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, this federal criminal statute requires a showing of intent, but a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare providers (such as nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined under the statute) and their immediate family members. Any failure to comply with these reporting requirements could result in significant fines and penalties. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe that we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that the government will agree with our determination, and a determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 
We are also subject to applicable state restrictions on laboratory billing. These laws vary from state to state but generally are intended to prevent a provider who ordered but did not perform the service from billing for that service at a markup. For example, California has an anti-markup statute with which we must comply, which prohibits a provider from charging for any laboratory test that it did not perform unless the provider (a) notifies the patient, client or customer of the name, address and charges of the laboratory performing the test, and (b) charges no more than what the provider was charged by the clinical laboratory that performed the test except for any other service actually rendered to the patient by the provider (for example, specimen collection, processing and handling). This provision applies, with certain limited exceptions, to licensed persons such as physicians and clinical laboratories regulated under California’s Business and Professions Code. A violation of this provision can lead to imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $10,000. Other states have similar anti-markup and other client billing restrictions with which we must comply. Many states also have "direct-bill" laws, which require the party that performed the service to bill for the service, with certain exceptions.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the fraud and abuse laws described above or any other healthcare regulatory laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
International Regulations 
Many countries in which we may offer any of our testing products in the future have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national healthcare program. In situations involving physicians employed by state-funded institutions or national healthcare agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and/or other applicable anti-corruption laws. 
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity from offering or providing, directly or through a third party, including any potential distributors we may rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We will also be required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions. 
The standard of intent and knowledge under the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions is minimal intent and knowledge are usually inferred from the fact that bribery took place. The FCPA’s accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2.0 million and officers, directors, stockholders, employees and agents are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and other Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. 
When marketing our testing products outside of the United States, we may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, prohibitions on the import of tissue necessary for us to perform our testing products or restrictions on the export of tissue imposed by countries outside of the United States or the import of tissue into the United States, and marketing approval. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may in some cases require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. 
Privacy and Security Laws 
U.S. Data Privacy and Security Laws
HIPAA established comprehensive federal standards for the privacy and security of health information. In 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amended HIPAA and, among other things, expanded and strengthened HIPAA, created new targets for enforcement, imposed new penalties for noncompliance and established new breach notification requirements. HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare clearing houses and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (collectively, Covered Entities), as well as individuals or entities that perform services for them involving the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information or "protected health information" (PHI) under HIPAA (Business Associates). Under HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of PHI used or disclosed by Covered Entities and Business Associates. HIPAA also regulates and standardizes the codes, formats and identifiers used in certain healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers, for example insurance billing. Any non-compliance with HIPAA and HITECH and related penalties, could adversely impact our business. 
The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures to maintain the security of protected health information.
The HIPAA privacy regulations address the privacy of PHI by limiting the use and release of such information. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI, request an accounting of disclosures of PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA breach notification regulations impose certain reporting requirements on Covered Entities and their Business Associates in the event of a breach of PHI. 
Covered Entities must report breaches of PHI that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of HHS (the Secretary). Breaches must be reported as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals, the HHS Secretary, and depending on the size of the breach, the local and national media. Covered Entities like us are also subject to the HHS HIPAA audit program and may be investigated in connection with a privacy or data security complaint.
Significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties may be imposed for violating HIPAA directly, and in connection with acts or omissions of any agents, including a downstream business associates, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Civil penalties are adjusted for inflation on an annual basis and can exceed one million dollars per year for failure to comply with a HIPAA requirement. A single breach incident can violate multiple requirements. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses PHI in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalties (including fines and imprisonment), which increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use PHI for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Covered Entities are also subject to enforcement by state Attorneys General who were given authority to enforce HIPAA.
Additionally, while HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.
Further, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the transaction standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is 
considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC and states' Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and comparable state laws.
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal "floor" and do not preempt state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI. Certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health-related and other personal information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. The State of California, for example, has implemented comprehensive laws and regulations. The California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. California has also recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. It also creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for PHI maintained by a Covered Entity or Business Associate under HIPAA and medical information maintained by healthcare providers under the CMIA, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) went into effect January 1, 2023 amending the CCPA. The CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data and expands the application of the CCPA to all human resources personal information of our California-based employees. It also created a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and is expected to result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. In addition to the CCPA, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah all enacted similar omnibus privacy laws that will also take effect in 2023, increasing the complexity of compliance and the risk of failures to comply.
Numerous other federal and state laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, as defined by state law, including prompt disclosure within a specified amount of time to affected individuals. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data privacy and data protection. 
Many states, such as Massachusetts, have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and requirements for protecting test results. The interplay of federal and state laws regulating genetic information may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on genetic privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify.
Information Blocking Rules
The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), coordinates the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide in the healthcare sector. In May 2020, ONC released the final Information Blocking Rule to implement the interoperability and patient access provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. We will need to continually review our practices for conduct that could be considered as likely to interfere with access, exchange or use of electronic health information, as those practices are prohibited by the Information Blocking Rule, unless one of the exceptions outlined in the Information Blocking Rule applies. Among other things, the Information Blocking Rule requires us to provide patients with on-demand access to laboratory test results. These requirements can be inconsistent with our obligations as a laboratory under state law and/or medical or ethical standards. It is currently unclear how the ONC will approach delays in providing patient access in these situations. Healthcare providers including laboratories will be subject to 
civil monetary penalties for violations of the Information Blocking Rule once the penalty regulations are finalized. The amount of such penalties is unknown, but the regulations for health industry numbers (HINs), health information exchanges (HIEs), and certified developers of health information technology allow for up to $1.0 million in penalties per violation.
GDPR and Foreign Laws 
We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our testing products. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into full effect in May 2018. The GDPR implements stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is collected and used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, more robust rights for individuals in regard to their personal data and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. It provides that European Union (EU), and European Economic Area (EEA), member states may make their own further laws and regulations, which may impose further limitations, including in relation to the processing of biometric or health data, which may result in differences between member state laws, limit our ability to use and share personal data, cause our costs to increase and/or harm our business and/or financial condition. Among other requirements, the GDPR also regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and the United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the EU. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (U.K. GDPR) which, together with the amended U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in U.K. national law. The U.K. GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how U.K. data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. In June of 2021, the European Commission granted the United Kingdom an adequacy decision with respect to data transfers under the GDPR. This adequacy decision is expected to last until June 27, 2025.
Billing and Government Reimbursement for Clinical Laboratory Services 
Medicare
Medicare coverage is limited to items and services, within the scope of a Medicare benefit category that are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. With respect to Medicare coverage, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) responsible for administering Medicare’s molecular diagnostic services program (MolDX Program), issued a Local Coverage Determination (LCD) that provides coverage for our AVISE® MTX test. The MAC responsible for administering Medicare claims submitted by our laboratory, Noridian Healthcare Solutions (Noridian), has adopted Palmetto’s positive coverage policy, along with a related local coverage article that identifies a unique billing identifier for this test. 
Under Medicare, payment for our laboratory tests are generally made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) with payment amounts assigned to specific procedure billing codes. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), which substantially changed the way in which Medicare sets the payment amounts for clinical laboratory services. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for "advanced diagnostic laboratory tests"), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. As required under PAMA, CMS uses the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests. 
On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under PAMA. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (CDLTs) are based upon these reported private payor rates. For CDLTs, for which there is no comparable existing CDLT, that are assigned a new or substantially revised Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, CMS will set the initial payment rates using the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law. Initial payment rates for new advanced 
diagnostic laboratory tests (ADLTs) will be based on the actual list charge. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to up to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2018 through 2020. As noted below, federal law has delayed implementation of further reductions until 2024, at which time the reduction cap will rise to 15% per test per year. PAMA did not impact Medicare reimbursement for AVISE® CTD in 2022 compared to levels experienced in 2021. Additionally, PAMA and changes to the PFS will not have a significant impact to Medicare reimbursement for AVISE® CTD in 2023 compared to levels experienced in 2022.
On December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act (LAB Act) took effect. The LAB Act delayed by one year the reporting of payment data under PAMA for CDLTs that are not ADLTs until the first quarter of 2021. The CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, delayed the reporting period by an additional year, until the first quarter of 2022. Then, on December 10, 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which included a provision that further delayed the next PAMA reporting period for CDLTs that are not ADLTs to January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, enacted on December 29, 2022, delayed the next PAMA reporting period to January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024, which will cover the original data collection period of January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019. New CLFS rates for CDLTs will be established based on that data beginning in 2025, subject to phase-in limits. As a result, Medicare payment rates determined by data reported in 2017 will continue through December 31, 2024. In addition, under PAMA, as amended, the payment reduction cap will be 15% per test per year in each of the years 2024 through 2026.
PAMA also authorized the adoption of new, temporary billing codes and unique test identifiers for FDA-cleared or approved tests, as well as ADLTs. The American Medical Association's (AMA) CPT Editorial Panel approved a proposal to create a new section of billing codes called Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) codes, to facilitate implementation of this section of PAMA. The AMA publishes approved codes on a quarterly basis. We requested a PLA code and in the quarter ended March 31, 2022, CMS agreed, effective April 1, 2022, to recognize a new PLA code for our protein-based test, AVISE® Lupus. 
Billing for diagnostic testing can be complicated. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we must bill various parties, such as commercial payors, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals, employer groups and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing process. Changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients or increase our costs. CMS also establishes new procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process for billing government healthcare programs. Missing or incorrect information on test requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled tests, and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs could also lead to various penalties, including:
▪overpayments and recoupments of reimbursement received;
▪exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs;
▪asset forfeitures;
▪civil and criminal fines and penalties; and
▪the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business.
Any of these penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. 
Healthcare Reform 
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in the United States. The ACA made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private payors. Although the ACA included a medical device tax, the tax never went into effect and was fully repealed by Congress with enactment of the 2019 federal spending package signed into law on December 20, 2019.
Since the ACA’s enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result, certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or were effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Supreme Court) upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory 
changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new Democrat-led presidential administration has been taking steps to strengthen the ACA. Future changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry in the United States. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels and the number of insured individuals, may lead to delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, and the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, will remain in effect through 2032, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may also be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the clinical laboratory industry.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Requirements
Our laboratory is subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds and blood and other tissue specimens. Typically, we use licensed or otherwise qualified outside vendors to dispose of this waste. However, many of these laws and regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. As a result, we could be held liable for damages and fines if our, or others', business operations or other actions result in contamination of the environment or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous materials. Our costs for complying with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated or predicted and depends on a number of factors, including the amount and nature of waste we produce (which depends in part on the number of tests we perform) and the terms we negotiate with our waste disposal vendors. In 2022, we disposed of all hazardous and/or medical waste that we produced across our entire business through environmentally sound methods.
Our operations are also subject to extensive requirements established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration relating to workplace safety for healthcare employees, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 204 employees: 199 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees. This includes 52 in laboratory operations, 9 in research and development, 62 in sales and marketing and 76 in general and administrative functions. All of our employees are located in the United States, none of which are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. Our employees are a significant asset and we aim to create an equitable, inclusive and empowering environment in which our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, retaining and expanding our workforce, as needed, to support our current pipeline and future business goals. By focusing on employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our business and operations, our pipeline, and also protect the long-term interests of our securityholders. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. Our efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and passionate workforce include providing competitive compensation and benefits packages and efforts to ensure our employees' voices are heard.
We value innovation, passion, data-driven decision making, persistence and honesty, and are building a diverse environment where our employees can thrive and be inspired to make exceptional contributions to bring novel testing products to patients.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, motivating and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through grants of stock-based compensation awards and payments of cash-based performance bonus awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We are committed to providing a competitive and comprehensive benefits package to our employees. Our benefits package 
provides a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual health and wellness needs of our employees. We plan to continue to refine our efforts related to optimizing our use of human capital as we grow, including improvements in the way we hire, develop, motivate and retain employees.
We conduct periodic anonymous employee surveys aimed at measuring the overall satisfaction of our team and make efforts to address issues brought to our attention. The results consistently show that our employees consider their work valuable and meaningful.
