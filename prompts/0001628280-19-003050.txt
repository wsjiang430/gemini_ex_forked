ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General
Linde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom.  Linde plc was formed in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated June 1, 2017, as amended, between Linde plc, Praxair, Inc. ("Praxair") and Linde Aktiengesellschaft ("Linde AG"). Effective October 31, 2018, the business combination was completed and Linde plc is comprised of the businesses of Praxair and Linde AG (hereinafter the combined group will be referred to as "the company" or "Linde").
The business combination brought together two leading companies in the global industrial gases industry, leveraging the proven strengths of each.  Linde believes the merger will combine Linde AG’s long-held expertise in technology with Praxair’s efficient operating model, thus creating a global leader. The company is expected to enjoy strong positions in key geographies and end markets and will create a more diverse and balanced global portfolio.
Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide.  It continues to be a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene). The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. The surface technologies segment supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders. 
 Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.
In 2018, the company, Praxair and Linde AG entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy antitrust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements required the sale of the majority of Praxair's European industrial gases business (completed on December 3, 2018), the majority of Linde AG's Americas industrial gases business (completed on March 1, 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are expected to be sold in 2019. As of December 31, 2018 and until the completion of the majority of such divestitures, Linde AG and Praxair were obligated to operate their businesses globally as separate and independent companies, and not coordinate any of their commercial operations. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (the “FTC”) hold separate order (“HSO”) restrictions were lifted March 1, 2019, concurrent with the sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the United States. See Notes 4 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to divestitures.
Praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Praxair for the periods prior to the business combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of the company. The results of Linde AG are included in Linde's consolidated results from the date of the completion of the business combination forward. Also, during 2018 the company reported its continuing operations in six reporting segments under which it managed its operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Surface Technologies and Linde AG. Linde AG became the sixth reportable segment effective with the merger on October 31, 2018.
Linde’s sales were $14,900 million, $11,437 million, and $10,534 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde’s reportable segments.
Industrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes
Atmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using air as its raw material, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Rare gases, such as krypton, neon and xenon, are also produced through cryogenic air separation. As a pioneer in the industrial gases industry, Linde is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology. Linde also led the development and commercialization of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. These technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases. These technologies include

proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption (“VPSA”) and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. 
Process gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation. Most carbon dioxide is purchased from by-product sources, including chemical plants, refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. Carbon dioxide is processed in Linde’s plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or auto-thermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha. Hydrogen is also produced by purifying by-product sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. Most of the helium sold by Linde is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water. 
Industrial Gases Distribution
There are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).
On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Advanced air separation processes allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. Customers using these systems usually enter into requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years.
Merchant. The merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and helium. The deliveries generally are made from Linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site which are owned and maintained by Linde and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three-to seven-year requirement contracts.
Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and related products. Linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders.
A substantial amount of the cylinder gases sold in the United States is distributed by independent distributors that buy merchant gases in liquid form and repackage the products in their facilities. Packaged gas distributors, including Linde, also distribute hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Over time, Linde has acquired a number of independent industrial gases and welding products distributors at various locations in the United States and continues to sell merchant gases to other independent distributors. Between its own distribution business, joint ventures and sales to independent distributors, Linde is represented in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Engineering
Linde’s Engineering Division has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as olefin, natural gas, air separation, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants. The company utilizes its own extensive process engineering know-how in the planning, project development and construction of turnkey industrial plants and associated services. Linde plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce hydrogen and synthesis gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. The Engineering Division either supplies plant components and services directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of Linde, which operates the plants on behalf of the customer under a long-term gases supply contract.

Surface Technologies
Surface Technologies is a leading worldwide supplier of coating services and thermal spray consumables to customers in the aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, petrochemical, textile, and other industries. Its coatings are used to provide wear resistance, corrosion protection, thermal insulation, and many other surface-enhancing functions which serve to extend component life, enable optimal performance, and reduce operating costs. It also manufactures a complete line of electric arc, plasma and wire spray, and high-velocity oxy-fuel ("HVOF") equipment.
Inventories – Linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases, hardgoods and coatings materials to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory. Inventory obsolescence is not material to Linde’s business.
Customers – Linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.
International – Linde is a global enterprise with approximately 60% of its 2018 sales outside of the United States. The company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries (including Germany, France, Sweden, the Republic of South Africa, and the United Kingdom ); approximately 20 Asian and South Pacific countries (including China, Taiwan, India and Australia); and approximately 20 Americas countries (including Canada, Mexico and Brazil).
The company also has equity method investments operating in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and North America (with the largest located in Germany, China, India, Malaysia, and the United States).
Linde’s international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies of local governments. Also, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
Seasonality – Linde’s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent.
Research and Development – Linde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation and hydrogen process technologies and the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. Research and development for industrial gases is principally conducted at Pullach, Germany; Tonawanda, New York and Burr Ridge, Illinois.
Linde conducts research and development for its surface technologies to improve the quality and durability of coatings and the use of specialty powders for new applications and industries. Surface Technologies research is conducted at Indianapolis, Indiana.
Patents and Trademarks – Linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Linde’s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. While these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses, Linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent, or patent license, or family of patents. Linde also owns a large number of trademarks, of which the "Linde" trademark is the most significant.
Raw Materials and Energy Costs – Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. The company mitigates electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass–through and tolling arrangements.
The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business. However, energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose unforeseen future risks.
For carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen, specialty gases and surface technologies, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions.
Competition – Linde participates in highly competitive markets in the industrial gases, engineering and healthcare businesses, which are characterized by a mixture of local, regional and global players, all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties. In locations where Linde has pipeline networks, which enable the company to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers, Linde derives a competitive advantage.
Competitors in the industrial and medical gases industry include global and regional companies such as L’Air Liquide S.A., Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Messer Group GmbH, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation (through Taiyo 
6

Nippon Sanso Corporation) as well as an extensive number of small to medium size independent industrial gas companies which compete locally as producers or distributors. In addition, a significant portion of the international gases market relates to customer-owned plants. 
Employees and Labor Relations – As of December 31, 2018, Linde had 80,820 employees worldwide. Linde has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world, which expire at various dates. Linde considers relations with its employees to be good.
