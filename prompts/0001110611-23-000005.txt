Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to transform the way businesses drive revenue and customer engagement through data-rich digital experiences.
We provide a leading, cloud-based platform for digital engagement that delivers insights for revenue growth through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. Our platform’s portfolio of interactive, personalized and content-rich digital experience products creates and captures actionable, real-time data at scale from millions of professionals every month to provide businesses with buying signals and behavioral insights to efficiently convert prospects into customers.
Similar to what has taken place in the business-to-consumer, or B2C, market, our platform for digital engagement empowers business-to-business, or B2B, companies with insights to better personalize their engagement. Large social media platforms have been successful at leveraging experiences and insights of consumers on their platforms to enable B2C companies to effectively understand their potential consumers. While these have been effective in the B2C market, B2B companies often lack deep insights about prospective customers to effectively understand and engage them.
Businesses today primarily use automated solutions, such as digital advertising and email, for marketing. While these automated solutions reach large numbers of prospective customers, they have generally failed to deepen customer engagement because they were designed with the simple purpose of pushing marketing messages in one direction – from the business to the prospective customer. As a result, marketing at scale has become synonymous with spam, which is often ignored by prospective customers and can even undermine the customer relationship. At the same time, prospective customers prefer to do their own research by accessing digital marketing resources before consulting with a salesperson to make a purchasing decision.
For businesses to succeed, we believe their sales and marketing strategies must evolve from the era of automation to the era of engagement. We are strategically positioned to help businesses and their sales and marketing organizations make this transition. Our platform provides an innovative way both to scale digital marketing and deepen prospective customer engagement. We believe our opportunity to help businesses convert digital engagement into revenue will continue to grow over time as industries modernize their sales and marketing processes. As our customers create more ON24 content-rich experiences, they gather more data directly from prospective customers, which we refer to as first-person data, to help them create a multiplier effect that strengthens their ability to convert prospective customers and generate revenue.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,990 customers. No single customer contributed more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
Industry Trends
B2B sales and marketing has shifted away from traditional approaches, such as “cold calling,” “snail mail,” industry networking events and in-office visits, to more scalable, digital-based approaches. Going forward, B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers are expected to increasingly occur in digital channels. As they transition to digital-based approaches, businesses are struggling to achieve deep levels of personalized engagement and interactivity. The most common digital marketing tactics that businesses use to operate sales and marketing programs at scale require them to make suboptimal tradeoffs: either annoy their customers with spam, which is frequently ineffective, or use third-party providers to run more expensive marketing campaigns that still may not be engaging or personalized to a prospective customer’s business needs. This has led to frustration and poor returns from digital sales and marketing investments.
The imperative to optimize digital sales and marketing investments to drive revenue conversion has become more important as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives. We believe this digital transformation has fundamentally changed the way businesses engage with their prospective customers, leading to an increased need for innovative methods of B2B engagement at scale to improve sales effectiveness and drive faster revenue growth. The following key trends are impacting sales and marketing strategies today:
•Personalized and interactive digital customer engagement at scale is the new imperative. The ability to engage with large numbers of prospective customers and customers cost-effectively is crucial. As businesses broadly embrace digital transformation initiatives, they are standardizing on cloud-based platforms to transform their sales and marketing strategies. Increased focus on next-generation digital marketing solutions offers our customers an opportunity to drive personalized and interactive prospective customer engagement at scale by aggregating a significant amount of insights on prospective customers. This enables businesses to optimize sales and marketing campaigns and drive revenue growth.

•Democratization of content has led prospective customers to self-educate. Ineffective marketing tactics coupled with broad availability of relevant content across multiple channels have shifted the mindset of B2B prospective customers. Because prospective customers are now self-educating by accessing information on products and brands in advance of purchasing decisions, marketers must adapt by identifying and providing relevant content to their prospective customers earlier in the sales process. We believe this will necessarily shift greater investment into content-rich, interactive platforms for digital engagement and away from low-touch marketing automation strategies.
•Traditional automated marketing approaches are increasingly ineffective. Traditional automated marketing tactics have limited effectiveness at engaging prospective customers because they are generic, intrusive and irrelevant. Having a limited understanding of a prospective customer’s intent and interest leads to largely ineffective, impersonal marketing, wasted sales and marketing investment and frustrated prospective customers. 
•Data privacy requirements are constraining automated digital marketing. Data privacy has become a fundamental area of focus for regulatory bodies given the digital transformation initiatives taking place and the plethora of spam used today. As privacy laws continue to expand and evolve, this puts pressure on traditionally automated methods of marketing at scale that have traditionally been highly dependent on information obtained from third parties. As a result, we believe there will be increased focus on engaging with customers directly and driving engagement through first party insights and integrations.
The new norms of digital transformation and targeting self-educating prospective customers have accelerated the need for cloud platforms that deliver personalized and interactive customer engagement at scale to drive revenue.
Limitations of Traditional Approaches to Customer Engagement at Scale
Businesses have struggled to adapt their marketing strategies for the era of digital engagement where interactions with prospective customers happen online. Traditional marketing tactics and general-purpose communication platforms suffer from many limitations, including:
•Failure to create content-rich, interactive experiences for prospective customers. As prospective customers increasingly self-educate, creating personalized, content-rich and interactive experiences is critical to generate engagement. Typical online sales and marketing strategies are built upon one-way communication from the marketer to their prospective customers, offering no opportunity for developing a meaningful exchange nor empowering prospective customers to dictate their own buying process.
•Limited opportunity for engagement, resulting in less prospective customer data. Highly engaging and interactive experiences generate valuable signals about prospective customers’ buying intentions that can inform the sales process and improve efficiency. To be able to capture and respond to those buying signals, businesses need the ability to track, record, contextualize and analyze prospective customer behavior in real-time. While in-person events, such as business conferences, can sometimes create engaging experiences, they do not allow for the automated and efficient collection of first-person data and are expensive to organize. General-purpose online meeting tools can enable businesses to reach many people at once, but they lack the engagement, analytics and first-person data that are needed to drive revenue. Meanwhile, traditional marketing automation tools collect only superficial data such as click rates that deliver limited understanding into what prospective customers want, what messages are resonating and how to more deeply engage and inform prospective customers that are seeking to learn more.
•Ineffective insights to convert prospects into customers. Insights about prospective customers are only valuable to businesses to the extent that they help convert prospects into customers. Providing contextualized and easy to access information to sales teams in real-time can materially improve their efficiency and improve revenue conversion. Technologies such as general purpose communications and collaboration tools have provided convenient alternatives to hosting physical meetings but were not designed to easily integrate into the broader sales and marketing systems that businesses use, and thus these tools have limited use in connecting real-time customer interaction with a business’s broader sales and marketing strategies.
•Inability to utilize behavioral insights to dynamically personalize content. By gaining insights into their prospective customers’ behavior and engagement, businesses are able to understand and measure the performance of their digital experiences. This understanding provides critical intelligence to optimize the subsequent creation and delivery of other digital experiences. Traditional approaches typically fail to utilize customer behaviors to dynamically adjust content and enable content personalization. 
•In-person events are resource intensive and exist in a discrete moment. A business conference exists in a discrete moment in time, is expensive, and cannot be re-created. In these scenarios, businesses only have one opportunity to engage with prospective customers at scale, and their return on investment is limited. Furthermore, the expectation in today’s new market dynamic is that all events have a digital component and that audiences are able to choose how they engage.

Our Platform and Key Differentiators
Our leading cloud-based platform for digital engagement enables businesses to convert customer engagement into revenue through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences that are backed by analytics and an ecosystem of third-party integrations.
Our portfolio of ON24 Core Platform Experience products include:
•ON24 Elite: live, interactive webinar experience that engages prospective customers in real-time and can also be made available in an on-demand format.
•ON24 Breakouts: live breakout room experience that facilitates networking, collaboration and interactivity between users.
•ON24 Forums: live, interactive experience that facilitates video-to-video interaction between presenters and audiences.
•ON24 Go Live: live, interactive video event experience that enables presenters and attendees to engage face-to-face in real-time and can also be made available in an on-demand format.
•ON24 Engagement Hub: always-on, rich multimedia content experience that prospective customers can engage in anytime, anywhere.
•ON24 Target: personalized and curated, rich landing page experience that engages specific segments of prospective customers to drive a desired action.
Our ON24 Core Platform Experience products are backed by our solutions, including:
•ON24 Intelligence: analytics backbone that captures first-person data to power the insights, benchmarking, reporting and artificial intelligence and machine learning, or AI/ML, engine within our platform.
•ON24 Connect: ecosystem of third-party application integrations.
•ON24 Services and Platform Support: a portfolio of professional services that provide consulting and support for product and platform adoption.
Our non-Core Platform Experience product includes:
•ON24 Virtual Conference: live, large scale, managed virtual event experience that engages prospective customers in real-time and can also be made available in an on-demand format. With the return of large-scale in-person events, we are seeing less demand for this managed-service product. Accordingly, we are deemphasizing this product. As such, we do not consider ON24 Virtual Conference as part of our Core Platform going forward.
We believe the key differentiators of our platform are:
•Designed to drive interactive customer experiences. Our platform was built to power a new kind of customer engagement – highly interactive real-time digital experiences that can scale engagement from hundreds to thousands of prospective customers simultaneously. Unlike spam, which is often ignored, our digital experiences engage prospective customers and encourage them to ask questions and learn about a business’s products and offerings more broadly. This real-time interaction is the foundation of our modern engagement platform and aligns with how B2B prospective customers are seeking to self-educate.
•Interactive customer engagement creates highly valuable customer insight data. Unlike more traditional approaches, creating and measuring customer engagement and interaction is at the center of our platform. Through our products, our customers can create interactive experiences that foster active engagement with their prospective customers and gather data in real time. This enables our customers to obtain rich, valuable insights and predictive analytics as well as integrate the resulting data and insights into their business applications.
•Prospective customer insights drive more efficient conversion of pipeline to revenue. The customer engagement and interaction data gathered through our platform enables businesses to derive deep insights about prospective customer behavior. These insights can drive higher-quality pipeline and ultimately better revenue conversion for our customers. Through our ecosystem of integrations with third-party marketing automation, customer relationship management, or CRM, and business intelligence, or BI, platforms, our customers can leverage insights derived through our platform to more intelligently engage with prospective customers in real-time.

•Flywheel effect drives continuous optimization. Years of capturing engagement insights have provided us with a deep understanding of how to best design digital experiences that engage prospective customers and generate more impactful revenue conversion. The more of our content-rich experiences that our customers create for their prospective customers to engage with, the more first-person data that our customers are able to collect in return. By leveraging AI/ML, our platform enables businesses to use this data to derive highly relevant and deep insights that fuel AI-driven content generation, personalized segmentation, enhanced analytics and reporting and dynamic content recommendations. These AI/ML-driven innovations further strengthen the engagement levels of experiences, enhancing the quality of the interaction data and insights derived through our platform. This combination of rich prospective customer data and AI/ML becomes a flywheel for better content creation, improved customer experiences, greater customer intelligence and enhanced revenue conversion.
•Experiences that can be repurposed and continuously drive engagement to maximize return on investment. Our customers are able to continuously drive results because ON24 digital experiences remain interactive and can continue to engage their prospective customers well after the initial live event ends. The experiences created through our platform are designed with persistent interactivity which gives our customers the ability to engage their prospective customers in either a live or on-demand experience. This flexibility makes it possible to repurpose and reuse digital experiences many times over with no incremental cost.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we have significant competitive strengths that will enable us to extend our market leadership position, including:
•Category defining platform for customer engagement at scale. We created one of the first cloud platforms for businesses to deliver interactive, data driven webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. We believe we have a first-mover advantage because our proprietary and proven platform has enabled our customers to build effective systems for digital engagement that generate high return on investment.
•Cloud-based system of engagement. Our cloud-based platform powers our customers with several key marketing capabilities: creating digital experiences, deploying them at scale, collecting numerous data points on their prospective customers, and leveraging this data to further personalize subsequent experiences. Consolidating these services onto one platform allows our customers to gather a more cohesive understanding of their prospective customers and take more targeted actions to more effectively convert prospects into customers. As a result, businesses no longer need to rely on a combination of standalone products.
•Broad, rich dataset and AI/ML capabilities power valuable insights. Our platform enables highly interactive experiences, giving our customers access to behavioral data that signals buying intent. By leveraging our AI/ML capabilities, our customers can derive valuable and actionable insights in order to optimize their sales and marketing strategies. For example, we help our customers understand what features of a digital experience drive the most engagement with prospective customers and heatmap key moments of an experience that had the greatest impact on audiences. Our customers can also use our platform to benchmark themselves against others in their industry to understand where they can improve as well as to synthesize lifetime behavior on our platform into an easy-to-use business interest report. They can also use our AI-driven content generation to automatically create promotional content. In addition, our customers can more effectively reach their prospects and customers by leveraging our AI/ML capabilities to dynamically personalize digital experiences for particular customers based on their prior behavior and interactions on our platform.
•Enterprise grade, highly scalable cloud platform. Our cloud-based platform has been developed to enable enterprise-grade scalability. This includes options and features to enable our customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align to their needs as well as integrations with a broad ecosystem of third-party applications. Our platform is available in over 20 languages and can be utilized seamlessly across multinational sales and marketing organizations. Our customers are able to use our platform to engage their prospective customers in multiple regions by supporting different streaming protocols, multilingual translation and closed captioning.
•Broad base of customers across verticals. We have a large and diverse set of customers across a broad set of industries. While our customer base decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, our customer base has grown significantly since 2015, from approximately 760 customers as of December 31, 2015 to 1,990 customers as of December 31, 2022. We intend to leverage our land and expand model to further penetrate customers across these verticals.
•Superior, dedicated customer service. Our solutions are designed to be easy to use, featuring drag-and-drop and other similar tools simplifying implementation by our customers. We offer technical support, chat support and live webinar experience emergency support that is available to our customers 24/7. Our platform support and customer success teams are organized into a “follow the sun model” to ensure consistent and reliable service across the globe.

Our Market Opportunity
We estimate the current total addressable market, or TAM, for our solutions is approximately $46 billion worldwide annually. We calculate our TAM by initially estimating the total number of companies that our platform and products can support in the United States across separate bands measured by number of employees: Enterprise, which includes companies with more than 2,000 employees, and Commercial, which includes companies with less than 2,000 employees, which we further divide into Mid-Market companies with 200-1,999 employees, and small and midsize, or SMB, companies with 1-199 employees, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau for 2019. We then apply an average annual value to the companies in each band. This value was calculated using internally generated data for annual recurring revenue, or ARR, as of December 31, 2022 for the top 25% of our customers by ARR that subscribe to two or more of our products, within each of the Enterprise and Mid-Market bands, and the top 25% by ARR of all our customers within the SMB band. We believe these calculations are representative of the current potential spend on our solutions by customers and prospective customers. We multiplied the total number of companies within each band by the calculated annual value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current annual estimated market opportunity in the United States of $23 billion. We believe the market opportunity for our solutions outside the United States is at least as large.
Our Growth Strategy
While we are currently operating in a challenging macro-economic environment, we intend to drive the growth of our business over time and the adoption of our solutions by executing the following strategies:
•Drive new customer acquisition. We believe our market is still relatively underpenetrated and that through scaling our sales force over time and through specialized and aligned sales teams focused on the Enterprise and Commercial markets globally, we can acquire new customers across the substantial Commercial market.
•Expand within existing customers. Our land and expand model is expected to drive expansion of new subscriptions within our existing customer base by selling subscriptions to additional parts of existing customers’ organizations, expanding into new regional divisions and upselling new solutions. In addition, we plan to develop new applications for our platform, including partner training and employee recruiting and forms of indirect marketing, such as education, enrollment and benefits programs.
•Continue to increase attachments and develop new solutions for specific use cases. We expect our business to grow both through increasing attachments for existing solutions and selling our existing customers new solutions that we develop in the future. For example, we have developed a differentiated feature set for our customers that use our platform to conduct online continuing education programs and issue accredited certifications. Our ecosystem of third-party integrations includes business applications in specific industries. We plan to continually develop new solutions that enhance the functionality of our platform and products, improve our customers’ experiences and drive engagement with their prospective customers. 
•Expand into new regions. We believe the expansion of our platform in international markets is a significant opportunity. We plan to continue to evaluate expansion opportunities for our solutions internationally, both in countries where we currently operate and countries where we do not yet sell subscriptions to our solutions.
•Identify and pursue inorganic growth opportunities. We plan to opportunistically evaluate and acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies that expand our platform, add different categories of experiences and support new use cases for our customers. We believe well-selected acquisitions may add significant value to our platform and expand the ability of our customers to gather engagement data to help them convert their prospective customers into revenue.

Our Technology and Infrastructure
Our platform and products have been developed to enable enterprise-grade scalability, performance, and reliability, designed to address all the complexities that come with live, interactive engagement with large audiences of prospective customers. Our platform has two main parts: a web application stack, and a streaming infrastructure stack, running on two co-located data centers in the United States and one in the European Union (EU). We also utilize public-cloud providers as part of our infrastructure.
Our web application stack processes requests from web browsers and APIs. Our streaming infrastructure stack processes live signal acquisition from our customers, encodes it, and delivers it to audiences via a redundant set of content delivery networks. The streaming infrastructure stack is designed to accept inputs from our customers on a wide variety of devices, combine them into an online virtual bridge, and to incorporate controls into the ON24 Elite Studio experience for presenters. The bridged signal is then encoded and distributed to diverse global audiences, who can access it as part of an online experience on desktop and mobile devices. This presentation contains video along with other interactive components, all synchronized and controlled by our customers. We continue to transition more of our capabilities to a hybrid cloud infrastructure, which we believe will enhance our platform’s flexibility and scalability.
We built our platform and products to address the robust performance demanded by large, multinational enterprises in the following ways:
•Performance and scalability: Our Cloud and Network Operations team runs this application in three data centers. This configuration has proven both scalable and cost effective. Our application architecture allows us to independently scale the systems that handle heavier loads, with a lightweight load-balancers routing traffic to additional machines as needed. With leading enterprise components, we expect our architecture to scale readily without any significant change as our business expands. 
•Privacy and compliance: Our platform includes features and options designed to support compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and other privacy laws, and provides options and features to enable customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align to their needs and relevant legal requirements. For example, our platform enables customers to implement tailored notice and consent language, customize registration forms and obtain consent for marketing and other processing activities. In addition, our flexible APIs allow businesses to build solutions to automate compliance with certain data subject requests. 
•Security: We conduct regular penetration tests, web vulnerability scans, and code reviews to enhance the security of our platform.

We believe that our highly responsive and effective support and education are an extension of our brand and are core to building and maintaining user trust. Our global customer success team is closely embedded with our customers and supports their day-to-day usage of our platform, including advising on best practices and providing technical support, services, and training. Our platform support team offers technical support, chat support and live webinar experience emergency support that is available to our customers 24/7. Our portfolio of services provides consulting, support for platform, and product and event adoption as well as support for experience management, monitoring and production. Our training team oversees onboarding, training, certification and a knowledge center.
Our global support team is based in 5 regional offices and is available 24/7 via in-product and presenter chat support. We have a data-driven process and well-established operations in place that proactively monitor our customers’ platform adoption, utilization and success. This approach enables us to efficiently scale our customer success operations as our customer base grows.
Research and Development

Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for customers with a number of different types of companies that offer a variety of products and services, including meeting tools, webinar software, virtual event software, video portal software, content management software, physical events, physical event software and digital marketing tools. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer. Many of our current and potential competitors have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Our solutions face competition. For example, a number of web-based meeting, webinar, and virtual event software products are offered by companies such as Zoom, LogMeIn, Intrado, Microsoft, Cisco, Cvent and Hopin. Many of these products have significantly lower prices. Although many of these companies do not currently offer products with real-time engagement features that gather the types and extent of actionable data that we gather, many of these companies have significantly greater resources and may be able to introduce similar products in the future. Additionally, we operate in a market characterized by an increasing number of new and competitive entrants. As we introduce new solutions, and with the introduction of new technologies, products and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are:
•functionality in providing rich, interactive digital experiences;
•ability to gather near real-time data insights for marketers;
•breadth of functionality within a single platform;
•ease of use and reliability; 
•cloud-based architecture;
•scalability;
•security, privacy and compliance;
•integration into leading marketing automation, CRM and BI platforms; and
•global, always available customer service and support.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We primarily rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a combination of patent, trade secret and domain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In the United States and abroad, as of December 31, 2022, we had 18 issued patents and 27 pending patent applications, the earliest of which expires in 2027. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Our trademarks and service marks include our name and logo, as well as various marketing slogans. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information.
These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated.
Regulatory Considerations
The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Businesses use our platform to engage with and market to their prospects and customers. In doing so, these businesses: (a) upload, broadcast, collect and store data and content within our platform, subject to relatively few general restrictions imposed by us, aside from the technical capabilities and limitation inherent in our platform, (b) use tools and reports available in our platform to access analytics and insights about attendees, experiences and content, and (c) personalize content and experiences to prospects and customers. This presents potential compliance challenges to our business and operations because we do not control customer content and information practices within our platform. Thus, we cannot ensure that information collection and processing by or on behalf of customers, within our platform, complies with applicable privacy, data protection and other laws. Similarly, we cannot ensure that customer content and use of our platform does not infringe or violate rights of privacy or intellectual property rights. At the same time, given the developing and varied nature of privacy and intellectual property laws globally, we cannot guarantee that ON24 would never be

subject to potential or actual claims or enforcement actions associated with customer content or use of our platform. Thus, both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and take steps to respond to a host of legal, compliance and risk issues regarding the data stored and processed by customers on our platform. These include, without limitation, the following:
Privacy, Data Protection and Security
Businesses use our platform to facilitate better engagement with their customers and prospects, derive insights about content and usage, and provide more meaningful and targeted experiences and content. These capabilities rely on collection and processing of information from and about customers and prospects that interact with the business or its content on our platform. As a result, compliance with laws and regulations regarding data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data breaches, and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of personal data, which we refer to as privacy laws, are critical to our compliance and risk strategy. Globally, numerous jurisdictions have passed or are actively considering new or amended privacy laws. As a result, privacy laws are increasing in number, enforcement, and fines and other penalties. Beyond legislative developments, decisions by courts and regulatory bodies relating to privacy laws can also have a significant impact on us and other businesses that operate across international jurisdictions.
In some cases, privacy laws apply directly to both ON24 and our customers and in other cases our customers pass through compliance obligations and requirements to us contractually. Further, under some privacy laws, ON24 may be considered a “processor” or a “service provider” and our customers a “controller” or “business,” while other privacy laws may not clearly distinguish between such roles. In all cases, however, ON24 must monitor, respond to and address privacy laws and related compliance, whether to ensure its own compliance or enable compliant use of its platform by ON24 customers. In general, our failure to adequately safeguard data adequately, address privacy compliance, or comply with our security and privacy commitments to customers could subject us, not only to contractual liability to customers and direct liability under privacy laws, but also to reputational harm and regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under U.S. (federal and state) and international laws and regulations relating to consumer protection and unfair business practices. More particularly, certain privacy law developments could have significant impacts to our platform and business. For example, privacy laws that restrict the use of personal information for marketing purposes or the tracking of individuals’ online activities (such as the EU’s proposed ePrivacy Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act), could expose us to additional regulatory burdens or necessitate changes to our platform or certain features. In addition, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws that impose data localization requirements or cross border data transfer restrictions on certain data. As with most cloud-based solutions, restrictions on the transfer of platform data outside of the originating jurisdiction pose particular challenges that could result in additional costs or otherwise impact platform use.
With the evolving legal landscape, the scope, interpretation and enforcement of privacy laws could change and new or amended laws may take effect. As a result, the associated burdens and compliance costs on us and our platform could increase in the future. Although we continue to monitor and respond to privacy legal developments and have invested in addressing major privacy law developments (such as the GDPR and the CCPA), it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the effect of these developments on our platform and business.
Copyrights
U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws protect the rights of third parties from infringement of their intellectual property. Our customers and their users can generally use our platform to upload and present a wide variety of content. We maintain a copyright infringement policy and respond to takedown requests by third-party intellectual property right owners that might result from content uploaded to our platform. As our business expands to other countries, we must also respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including takedown and cease-and-desist notices in foreign languages, and we must build infrastructure to support these processes. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, also applies to our business. This statute provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright-protected technologies but includes a safe harbor that is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites or hosting content that infringes copyrights of others. The copyright infringement policies that we have implemented for our platform are intended to satisfy the DMCA safe harbor.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 640 full-time employees. Of these employees, 487 are based in the United States and 153 are based in international locations. The members of our management team and our board of directors come from diverse backgrounds, and we seek to attract and recruit diverse, talented, experienced and motivated employees. In order to develop and improve our platform, we must invest in attracting, developing and retaining key talent. We monitor our progress with human capital metrics such as turnover, time to fill open roles and rate of internally developed talent. Our brand, market position, reputation for innovation and culture support our ability to recruit and retain talented employees across our departments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
ON24, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ON24, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2022 due to the adoption of FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.

ON24, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
ON24, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, ON24 or the Company) provides a leading, cloud-based platform for digital engagement that delivers insights for revenue growth through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. The Company’s platform offers a portfolio of interactive, personalized and content-rich digital experience products that creates and captures actionable, real-time data at scale from millions of professionals every month to provide businesses with buying signals and behavioral insights to efficiently convert prospects into customers. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 1998 as NewsDirect, Inc. and in December 1998 changed its name to ON24, Inc. The Company is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
Initial Public Offering
On February 5, 2021, the Company closed its initial public offering (IPO) of 7,599,928 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $50 per share for net proceeds of approximately $347.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of approximately $26.6 million and other offering costs of approximately $5.6 million. The shares of common stock sold in the IPO and the net proceeds from the IPO included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.
Upon the closing of the IPO, all of the Company's outstanding shares of Class A-1 and Class A-2 convertible preferred stock and Class B and Class B-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into an aggregate of 27,227,466 shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ON24 Inc. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for annual financial reporting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified on the consolidated balance sheets and in Note 5 to conform to the current year's presentation. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2022 (as further discussed below), capital leases and equipment loans were reported together as long-term debt, current and non-current, on the consolidated balance sheets. Upon the adoption of the new lease standard, capital leases are now presented separately as finance leases, current and non-current, on the consolidated balance sheets. The current and non-current portion of equipment loans have been reclassified to accrued and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, the determination of standalone selling price for the Company’s performance obligations, the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing reserve, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the assumptions used to measure stock-based compensation, the valuation of deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Risks
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities with high-quality financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with banks in the U.S. and are insured to the extent defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. For concentration of risks on accounts receivables and revenue, refer to Note 2.
Table of Contents

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and highly liquid investments, primarily money market mutual funds purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. Restricted cash included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets consists of term deposits to collateralize our Sydney operating lease.
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase since it is intended that these investments are available for current operations. These investments are included within cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Investments are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the statements of comprehensive income (loss) unless they are determined to be other-than-temporary impairments. The ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company categorizes assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets based on the accounting guidance framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level.
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. U.S. GAAP describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure the fair value:
Level 1 – observable inputs for identical assets or liabilities, such as quoted prices in active markets. 
Level 2 – directly or indirectly observable Inputs other than Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s investment portfolio consists of money market mutual funds, available for sale debt securities and certificates of deposit, which are carried at fair value.
Accounts Receivable
See Note 2, Revenue, for the Company’s accounting policy on accounts receivable.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Significant improvements that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. There were no impairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Table of Contents

Deferred Offering Costs
Deferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal and other fees incremental and directly related to the Company’s IPO. Upon closing of the IPO on February 5, 2021, the deferred offering costs of $5.6 million were reclassified into stockholders' equity (deficit) and recorded against the proceeds from the offering.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for these services. To achieve the core principle of this standard, the Company applies the following five steps:
1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer
The Company determines a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company will evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations committed to in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
The Company’s performance obligations generally consist of access to its digital engagement platform and related support services, which, together, are considered one performance obligation. The Company’s customers do not have the ability to take possession of the Company’s software, and, through access to the Company’s platform, the Company provides a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the applicable subscription. Customers may also purchase incremental capacity to the Company’s digital engagement platform. The Company recognizes incremental access as a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the remaining term of the applicable subscription. The Company’s Legacy offering includes performance obligations to provide customers with access to the Company’s platform for the duration of specific contracted events, and revenue is recognized primarily as events occur. Amounts related to the Company’s digital engagement platform and Legacy offering are recorded as subscription and other platform revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company also provides professional services, which includes consulting services, such as experience management, monitoring and production services, implementation services and premium support services. Professional services are generally considered distinct from the access to the Company’s digital engagement platform. Amounts are recorded as Professional Services revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company enters contracts with customers that regularly include promises to transfer multiple services through access to the Company’s platform. For arrangements with multiple services, the Company evaluates whether the individual services qualify as distinct performance obligations. In its assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, the Company determines whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources and whether the service is separately identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires the Company to assess the nature of each individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services are significantly integrated, highly interrelated or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract.
3. Determination of the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-32-18 of Topic 606 and does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts that are one year or less, and none of our multi-year contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes), which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities.
Table of Contents

The Company’s digital engagement platform and related support services are typically warranted to perform in a professional manner that will comply with the terms of our subscription agreements. In addition, the Company includes service level commitments to its customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits in the event that the Company fails to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form of variable consideration. Historically, the Company has not experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by its subscription agreements. The Company has not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price (SSP). The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, establishing SSP requires significant judgement. The Company estimates the SSP by considering available information, such as market conditions, internally approved pricing guidelines and the underlying cost of delivering the performance obligation.
5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company recognizes subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable contract subscription period beginning on the date access to the Company’s platform is granted. The Company recognizes revenue from consulting services related to events in the period the event occurs and the service is delivered. The Company recognizes revenue from implementation services upon completion of the services. The Company recognizes revenue from premium support offerings on a ratable basis over the applicable subscription term.
Costs to Obtain a Contract
The Company capitalizes sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel and third-party referral fees that are incremental costs resulting from obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. 
Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years as the Company specifically anticipates renewals of customer contracts and commissions paid on renewal contracts are not commensurate with commissions paid on new customer contracts. Sales commissions paid upon renewal of customer contracts are amortized over the contractual renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Sales commissions paid related to professional services are amortized over the expected service period. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and the technological life of its platform and related significant features. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs was $15.7 million, $15.2 million and $11.1 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
The Company periodically reviews these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. The Company had no impairment losses relating to deferred contract acquisition costs during the periods presented.
Cost of Revenue
Subscription and Other Platform Cost of Revenue
Subscription and other platform cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company’s platform and providing operating support services to its customers. These costs are related to the Company’s co-located data centers, personnel-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees and allocated overhead.
Professional Services Cost of Revenue
Professional services cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, third-party consulting services and allocated overhead.
Table of Contents

Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with the Company’s research and development employees, contractor costs related to third-party development and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations and amounted to $14.8 million, $17.3 million and $9.2 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate of return; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Right-of-use (ROU) asset is determined based on the lease liability initially established and reduced for any prepaid lease payments and any lease incentives received. The lease term to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. 
Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets but expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component for its new or modified office facility operating leases entered into on or after January 1, 2022.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards. For time based stock awards, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally three to four years for restricted stock unit awards and four years for option awards. For market performance-based stock awards, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally three years.
The fair value of each restricted stock unit (RSU) is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. 
The fair value of each market performance-based restricted stock unit (PSU) is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation which factors in the number of awards to be earned based on the achievement of the market condition. This model simulates the various stock price movements of the Company and the constituent company of the benchmark index using certain assumptions such as stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. Compensation cost is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is ultimately satisfied.
The fair value of each option award and purchase right under the employee share purchase plan (ESPP) is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the risk-free interest rates, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the Company’s stock price and the expected dividend yield.
The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the PSU and option awards are highly subjective and represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and application of management’s judgement. 
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company elected to account for forfeited awards as they occur. Prior to 2021, the Company estimated the number of awards expected to be forfeited at the time of grant and revised its estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differed from the estimates.
Table of Contents

Foreign Currency
The functional currencies of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are each country’s local currency. Assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the reporting date. Amounts classified in stockholders’ deficit are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains or losses, whether realized or unrealized, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations within other (income) expense, net, and have not been material for all periods presented.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company then assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized. Due to our lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
The Company recognizes benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on their technical merits at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of provision for income taxes.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company calculates net income (loss) per share attributable to common stock using the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The Company considers its convertible preferred stock and unvested common stock to be participating securities as holders of such securities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of the Company’s declaration of a dividend for shares of common stock. In periods when the Company is in a net loss position, the net loss attributable to common stockholders was not allocated to the convertible preferred stock and unvested common stock under the two-class method as these securities do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses.
Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income (loss) in determining net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding.
The diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding. During the periods when there is a net loss attributable to common stockholders, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive.
Segment Information
The Company operates in one operating segment and one reportable segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.
Recent Accounting Standards
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2021-08 amended Topic 805 to require an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination to be in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company early adopted this ASU on April 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Topic 326: Credit Losses Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended, which requires an entity to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable

forecasts utilizing a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The new guidance affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public business entities, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, ASU No. 2016-13, is effective for the annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. For all other entities ASU No. 2016-13, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal year. The Company has elected to use the extended transition period that allows the Company to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended, to supersede existing guidance on accounting for leases in Topic 840, Leases. Topic 842 generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. 
The Company adopted the new lease standard effective January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis using the effective date transition method, which applied the provisions of the new guidance at the effective date without adjusting the comparative periods presented. On the adoption date, the Company recognized on its consolidated balance sheets $7.2 million of additional right-of-use assets, $9.6 million additional lease liabilities, and derecognized existing deferred rent and lease incentives totaling $2.4 million. The Company’s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.
The Company elected a number of the practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. This included the election to apply the practical expedient package upon transition, which comprised the following:
•The Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease;
•The Company did not reassess the classification of existing leases; and
•The Company did not reassess the accounting treatment for initial direct costs.
The Company also elected to apply the hindsight practical expedient which allows the Company to use hindsight in determining the lease term. 
In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient related to short-term leases, which allows the Company not to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for leases with an initial expected term of 12 months or less. The Company also elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for operating facility leases.
Other than described above, the adoption of the new lease standard did not have any other material impacts on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 has no impact on the Company’s debt-covenant compliance under its current revolving credit facility. See Note 8 for additional disclosure on leases.

Contract Balances
Accounts receivable: The Company records accounts receivable when the Company has a contractual right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to consideration for the Company’s performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting in an unbilled receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and billing reserves on the consolidated balance sheets and were not material.
Contract assets: The Company records a contract asset when the Company has satisfied a performance obligation but does not yet have an unconditional right to consideration. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Contract liabilities: The Company defers its revenue when the Company has the right to invoice in advance of performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized during the following 12-month period and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The amount of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period was $92.0 million.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The terms of the Company’s subscription agreements are primarily annual and, to a lesser extent, multi-year. The Company may bill for the full term in advance or on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis, depending on the terms of the agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $146.2 million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $84.2 million and unbilled consideration in the amount of $62.0 million that the Company expects to recognize as revenue.

The Company reviews the individual securities that have unrealized losses on a regular basis to evaluate whether any security has experienced other-than-temporary decline in fair value below amortized cost. The Company evaluates, among other factors, whether the Company has the intention to sell any of these marketable securities and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Since the Company has the ability to hold its investments until maturity, and the decline in fair value was not due to any credit-related factor, no decline was deemed to be other-than-temporary. 
The Company had no realized gains or losses from marketable securities that were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in 2021 and 2020. The amount of realized gains or losses from marketable securities that were reclassified out from accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2022 was immaterial.

Note 9. Credit Facility
In September 2021, the Company amended its revolving line of credit with a financial institution effective August 2021, which increased the Company's borrowing capacity to a maximum of $50.0 million with a letter of credit sublimit of $4.0 million and a credit card sublimit of $1.0 million. The amendment allows the Company to borrow up to $50.0 million if the Company maintains at least $100.0 million on deposit at the institution. If such deposit is less than $100.0 million, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of $50.0 million or an amount determined by the Company's trailing five months of recurring revenue, annualized renewal rate and annualized monthly churn rate, as defined by the agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not drawn down on its line of credit and has a borrowing capacity of $50.0 million. The terms of the agreement permit voluntary prepayment without premium or penalty. The revolving credit facility matures in August 2024 and is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The outstanding principal balance on the revolving line of credit, if any, is due at maturity. The Company is required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on the undrawn portion available under the revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an outstanding standby letter of credit of $1.2 million as a guarantee for a leased space.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable monthly in arrears at a rate equal to the lender’s prime referenced rate as defined in the agreement. Prior to this amendment, interest on the revolving line of credit was the prime rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate), plus 0.75% effective July 31, 2020, and Prime Rate plus 0.50% prior to July 31, 2020. The prime referenced rate was 7.50% as of December 31, 2022 and 3.25% as of December 31, 2021.
Table of Contents

The revolving credit facility is subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants, including the requirement of maintaining a minimum debt to EBITDA ratio when the Company’s current portion of the total borrowing exceeds $5.0 million and the Company fails to maintain $100.0 million in deposits. In addition, the revolving line of credit agreement restricts the Company from paying dividends without prior approval from the financing institution. The Company was not subject to the financial covenants as of December 31, 2022.
Note 10. Commitment and Contingencies
Purchase Obligations
The Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments of $3.5 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to software license fees and co-location facilities and services, of which $3.2 million is expected to be paid in 2023 and $0.3 million in 2024.
Contingencies 
The Company has agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that may enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 
FASB ASC 450-20, Contingencies, sets forth the rules for accounting for uncertain tax positions for taxes not based on income. When a loss contingency exists, the likelihood of the incurrence of the liability can range from probable to remote. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that a loss will result from the sales and use tax assessments in the range of zero to $0.4 million. The Company has not recorded an accrual as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
Legal Proceedings 
The Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, certain current and former members of its Board of Directors and the underwriters that participated in the Company’s IPO are named as defendants in a consolidated putative class action, captioned In re ON24, Inc. Securities Litigation, 4:21-cv-08578-YGR (filed in November 2021), that is currently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The consolidated complaint purports to assert claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased, or otherwise acquired, the Company’s common stock issued in connection with the Company’s IPO. The complaint alleges that the Company’s registration statement and prospectus contained untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted material facts about ON24’s growth and customer base. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, an award of damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in May 2022, which is currently pending. The Company believes the allegations in the consolidated complaint are without merit. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss, if any, arising from this matter at this early stage. Accordingly, no accrued litigation expense has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In June 2022, a shareholder derivative complaint, captioned Banks v. Sharan, et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-03861, was filed by a purported shareholder in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint names as defendants the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and certain current and former members of the Company’s board of directors, and names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint purports to assert claims on the Company’s behalf against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty and alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint is based on allegations that are substantially similar to those in the putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, described above. The complaint seeks, among other things, an award of damages on behalf of the Company, corporate governance reforms, and attorneys’ fees and costs. In September 2022, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the complaint without prejudice.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject from time to time to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes or claims. Although the Company cannot predict with assurance the outcome of any litigation, the Company does not believe there are currently any actions, other than those described in the prior paragraph, that if resolved unfavorably, would have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Pursuant to the automatic annual increase, 2,377,740 additional shares were reserved under the 2021 Plan on January 1, 2023. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units,

Restricted Stock Unit with Performance Conditions (PSUs)
In 2022, the Company’s board of directors granted 341,404 market performance-based restricted stock units to an executive officer with a grant date fair value of $4.2 million. The PSUs vest following three annual performance periods, each in an amount equal to one-third of the target number of PSUs multiplied by a percentage determined by comparing the Company’s total stockholder return to a benchmark index during the performance period. The actual payout can range from 0% to 200% of the shares granted under this award, with the maximum earned PSUs capped at 125% for first two performance periods. The maximum payout for the entire award is capped at 200% of the granted shares. These PSUs additionally are subject to continued service by the award holder through the end of each performance period. As of December 31, 2022, none of these PSUs have vested.
Table of Contents

In 2014, the Company’s board of directors granted 187,500 performance-based restricted stock units to an executive officer with a grant date fair value of $0.5 million. These PSUs were fully vested upon the satisfaction of a one year service condition and the achievement of the IPO in February 2021. The Company recognized the related stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million upon the consummation of its IPO.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In January 2021, the Company’s board of directors adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which became effective in connection with the Company’s IPO. A total of 1,300,000 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance cumulatively increases automatically on January 1, 2022 and on each subsequent January 1, through and including January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (a) 1% of the number of shares of stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, (b) 1,300,000 shares, or (c) an amount determined by the Company’s board of directors. Pursuant to the automatic annual increase, 475,548 additional shares were reserved under the ESPP Plan on January 1, 2023.
 All eligible employees may participate in the ESPP and may contribute up to 20% of their earnings (as defined in the ESPP) for the purchase of the Company’s common stock under the ESPP. Unless otherwise determined by the Company’s board of directors, common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the ESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of purchase. Offering periods generally start on the first trading day on or after May 16 and November 16 of each year, except for the first offering period, which commenced on the effective date of the Company’s IPO and ended on November 15, 2021. 
In 2022 and 2021, employees purchased 200,235 and 75,027 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $7.90 and $14.04 per share under the ESPP, respectively.
Fair Value Determination
The Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options and employee stock purchase rights at the grant dates are as follows. There were no employee options granted in 2022 or employee stock purchase rights granted prior to 2021.

The Monte Carlo assumptions used to value the market performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs) at the grant dates are as follows.
PSUs

 | Year Ended December 31,

Expected term | 3.01 years 
Expected volatility | 59.00% 
Risk-free interest rate | 4.16 | % | - | 4.71%
Dividend yield | —% 

The assumptions and estimates of Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo valuations were determined as follows:
•Fair Value of Common Stock. The fair value of each share of underlying common stock is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on the date of the grant on the New York Stock Exchange.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
•Expected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The Company’s historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, the Company estimates the expected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The expected term of ESPP is the length of purchase period. The expected term of the PSUs is the longer of the requisite service period or the performance period.
•Expected Volatility. For options and ESPP purchase rights granted in and prior to 2021, since the Company has a short trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility is estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in its industry that are similar in size, stage of life cycle, financial leverage or market capitalization, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. For ESPP purchase rights granted after 2021, the expected volatility is equal to our historical volatility over the purchase period. For PSUs granted in 2022, the expected volatility is estimated using a weighting of our historical volatility and the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies.
•Expected Dividend Yield. The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.

Repurchase of Common Stock
In December 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program. The timing and number of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, and general business and market conditions. The share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. 
When the Company repurchased shares under the program, it reduced the common stock component of stockholder’s equity by the par value of the repurchased shares. The excess of the repurchase price over par value of the shares was charged to additional paid in capital as the Company is in an accumulated deficit position. All repurchased shares were retired and became authorized and unissued shares.
 The following table presents certain information regarding shares repurchased under the program during the periods presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 
Number of shares repurchased | 2,460,361 | | | 428,218 | | 
Average price per share, including commissions | $ | 11.84 | | | $ | 16.88
Total repurchase costs, including commissions (in millions) | $ | 29.1 | | | $ | 7.2 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $13.7 million available for future share buybacks under the repurchase program. 
The Company repurchased an additional 526,198 shares of common stock at an average per share price of $8.95 (including commissions) from January 1, 2023 through February 3, 2023.
In March 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved the expansion of its previously announced $100.0 million capital return program by an incremental $25.0 million. The new $125.0 million program comprises a special dividend of $50.0 million in the aggregate and an accelerated stock repurchase program and/or open market purchases of approximately $75.0 million. The Company may pay an additional special dividend if this $75.0 million threshold is not reached by March 2024.
12. Employees Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a retirement savings plan, or the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants may contribute up to applicable annual Internal Revenue Code limits. The 401(k) Plan provides for automatic salary deferrals of 3% of compensation with a 1% escalator each year. Participants are permitted to waive the automatic deferral provision. All participants’ deferrals, rollovers and matching contributions are 100% vested when contributed. The 401(k) plan allows the Company to make matching contributions and profit-sharing contributions to eligible participants. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company began making contributions of up to $500 per year to eligible participants. The contribution expense was $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), foreign accumulated earnings that were subject to the mandatory transition tax as of December 31, 2017, can be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring further U.S. federal tax. The Tax Act moves towards a modified territorial tax system through the provision of a 100% dividend received deduction for the foreign-source portions of dividends received from controlled foreign subsidiaries. As a result, the Company continues to evaluate the indefinite reinvestment assertions with regards to unremitted earnings for our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the total undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries were approximately $4.3 million, $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Historically, the Company has asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the portion of the undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested is not material.

The Company assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence, including a history of taxable income and estimates of future taxable income. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to the losses the Company generated in prior years, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company established a full valuation allowance on its U.S. net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance on its net foreign deferred tax assets as the Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset in its foreign jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $123.5 million for federal income tax purposes, of which a portion will begin to expire in 2023 if unused. As a result of Tax Act, $88.2 million of the federal net operating loss carryovers will carryover indefinitely and are limited to 80% of taxable income. The Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $87.6 million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2025 if unused.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $5.4 million for federal income tax and $5.3 million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development tax credit will begin to expire in 2028 if unused. State research and development tax credits carryforward indefinitely.
The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar provisions under state law. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the federal net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences, including significant ownership changes. The Company completed a review of any potential limitation on the use of its net operating losses under Section 382 through December 31, 2022. Based on such review, the Company does not believe Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code will adversely impact its ability to use its current net operating losses to offset future taxable income, if any,
The Company complies with ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. This pronouncement sets a “more likely than not” criterion for recognizing the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions. There are no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date. If recognized, $0.4 million would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company recognized an immaterial amount of interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax authorities for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized. There have been no examinations of our income tax returns by any tax authority.
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into the U.S. law, which implements a new alternative minimum tax for some large corporations, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and significant tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. The Inflation Reduction Act does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
