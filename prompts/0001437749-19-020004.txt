Item 1. Business
Corporate Organization
 
Uranium Energy Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 16, 2003 under the name Carlin Gold Inc. During 2004, we changed our business operations and focus from precious metals exploration to uranium exploration in the United States. On January 24, 2005, we completed a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of one share for each two outstanding shares and amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Uranium Energy Corp. Effective February 28, 2006, we completed a forward stock split of our common stock on the basis of 1.5 shares for each outstanding share and amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share to 750,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. In June 2007, we changed our fiscal year end from December 31 to July 31 (in each instance our “Fiscal” year now).
 
On December 31, 2007, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, UEC Resources Ltd., under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. On December 18, 2009, we acquired a 100% interest in the South Texas Mining Venture, L.L.P. (“STMV”), a Texas limited liability partnership, from each of URN Resources Inc., a subsidiary of Uranium One Inc., and Everest Exploration, Inc. On September 3, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, UEC Paraguay Corp., under the laws of the State of Nevada. On May 24, 2011, we acquired a 100% interest in Piedra Rica Mining S.A., a private company incorporated in Paraguay. On September 9, 2011, we acquired a 100% interest in Concentric Energy Corp., a private company incorporated in the State of Nevada. On March 30, 2012, we acquired a 100% interest in Cue Resources Ltd. (“Cue”), a formerly publicly-traded company incorporated in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. On March 4, 2016, we acquired 100% interest in JDL Resources Inc., a private company incorporated in Cayman Islands.

On August 9, 2017, we acquired a 100% interest in AUC Holdings (US), Inc. On January 31, 2018, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary under the laws of the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, UEC Resources (SK) Corp.
 
Our principal offices are located at 500 North Shoreline Boulevard, Suite 800N, Corpus Christi, Texas, 78401, and 1030 West Georgia Street, Suite 1830, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.
 
General Business
 
We are pre-dominantly engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on uranium projects located in the United States and Paraguay. We utilize in-situ recovery (“ISR”) mining where possible which we believe, when compared to conventional open pit or underground mining, requires lower capital and operating expenditures with a shorter lead time to extraction and a reduced impact on the environment. We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and/or underground mining techniques. We have one uranium mine located in the State of Texas, the Palangana Mine, which utilizes ISR mining and commenced extraction of uranium oxide (“U3O8”), or yellowcake, in November 2010. We have one uranium processing facility located in the State of Texas, the Hobson Processing Facility, which processes material from the Palangana Mine into drums of U3O8, our only sales product and source of revenue, for shipping to a third-party storage and sales facility. Since commencement of uranium extraction from the Palangana Mine in November 2010 to July 31, 2019, the Hobson Processing Facility has processed 580,100 pounds of U3O8. At July 31, 2019, we had no uranium supply or “off-take” agreements in place.
 
Our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our regional operating strategy in the State of Texas, specifically in the South Texas Uranium Belt, where we utilize ISR mining. We utilize a “hub-and-spoke” strategy whereby the Hobson Processing Facility acts as the central processing site (the “hub”) for our Palangana Mine and future satellite uranium mining activities, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium Belt (the “spokes”). The Hobson Processing Facility has a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U3O8 annually and is licensed to process up to one million pounds of U3O8 annually.
 
At July 31, 2019, we hold certain mineral rights in various stages in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, in Canada and in the Republic of Paraguay, many of which are located in historically successful mining areas and have been the subject of past exploration and pre-extraction activities by other mining companies. We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and/or underground mining techniques.

Our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our uranium extraction activities, which includes advancing certain uranium projects with established mineralized materials towards uranium extraction, and establishing additional mineralized materials on our existing uranium projects or through acquisition of additional uranium projects.
 
During Fiscal 2019, we continued to operate the Palangana Mine at a reduced pace since implementing our strategic plan in September 2013, to align our operations to a weak uranium market in a challenging post-Fukushima environment. This strategy has included the deferral of major pre-extraction expenditures and remaining in a state of operational readiness in anticipation of a recovery in uranium prices.
 
During Fiscal 2019, we made significant advancements in various aspects of our operations including:
 

● | we secured further financing by completing a public October 2018 Offering of 12,613,049 units of the Company at a price of $1.60 per unit for gross proceeds of approximately $20 million;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with our Lenders and extended our $20,000,000 senior secured Credit Facility by deferring required principal repayments until maturity and extending the maturity date to January 31, 2022;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we completed a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Uranium Royalty Corp. ("URC"), where we sold a 1% net smelter return royalty (collectively, the "Royalties") for uranium only at our Slick Rock, Workman Creek and Anderson projects. As consideration for the sale of the Royalties, the Company received 12 million common shares of URC; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we completed an updated NI 43-101 Technical Report to consolidate the resource for the then Reno Creek Project and the North Reno Creek Project acquired in Fiscal 2018. Additionally, the Reno Creek Permit to Mine and the NRC Source Material License were combined into one Permit to Mine, which was approved by the Land Quality Division Uranium Recovery Program in March 2019;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we advanced permitting activities at the Burke Hollow Project and received a Radioactive Materials License after receipt of the Mine Area Permit and Aquifer Exemption in Fiscal 2017 and the two Class I disposal well permits in Fiscal 2016, completing the last permit required for uranium extraction; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we commenced a drilling campaign to prepare for development of the first production area where we drilled 31 exploration/delineation holes and completed 51 monitor wells totaling 33,615 feet at the Burke Hollow Project.

Uranium Industry Background
 
The need for reliable, non-intermittent, pollution free electricity continues to rise as the world’s population grows to new record levels. By 2030 projections increase over 13% from 2019 levels to 8.5 billion people on the planet. This growth and efforts to reach associated global climate change goals are important drivers for the projected long-term increase in nuclear power’s carbon-free electricity and uranium demand. The world’s current operating fleet of nuclear power plants, in addition to the global growth in new reactors under construction and those planned, is testimony to the confidence in nuclear power to provide safe, economical and carbon free electricity as part of an overall energy supply mix.
 
The International Energy Agency reported “global electricity demand increased 4% in 2018”, and that “11.2 GWe of additional nuclear capacity were connected to the grid, the largest increase since 1989”. As of August 2019, World Nuclear Association (“WNA”) data showed 444 reactors operable worldwide with 54 new reactors under construction, 111 reactors planned or on order and another 330 proposed. In the Nuclear Technology Review 2019 report, the International Atomic Energy Agency projects global nuclear capacity could grow to about 511 GWe by 2030. From the current level of 396 GWe, this amounts to about a 30% increase in nuclear generation capacity. The WNA also reports further capacity is being generated by uprating existing plants and by plant lifetime extensions, particularly in the United States. Globally, for the sixth consecutive year, global nuclear generation increased. This past year nine new reactors started operations and at least another 20 more are due to come on-line by the end of 2020.

With 42 reactors connected to the grid in the past six years, nuclear power has reached its highest level of growth in over 25 years. Most of the growth in nuclear power is coming from countries like China and India, although there is also notable growth in other countries, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as new prospective entries like Saudi Arabia. Some of these countries have embarked on sovereign-backed uranium acquisition programs, building inventory stockpiles for their future requirements. This also includes substantial long-term contracting with western suppliers and taking controlling interests in individual mines. In addition, Russia, China and South Korea are aggressively pursuing programs to sell their reactors around the globe. In many cases the sales agreements contain turnkey provisions, including uranium supply as a component of the reactor package, that will require far more uranium than they currently produce. As such, they will need to carve out large supply sources in the coming years.
 
Global generation from nuclear power has eclipsed pre-Fukushima levels, although Japan restarts have been slower than expected. To date a total of 25 reactors have applied for restart and include the nine reactors that have restarted and six more that have been approved for restart. More restarts are expected as Japan ramps back up towards a policy goal of 20-22 percent of their total electrical generation from nuclear power by 2030.
 
World base case uranium demand is about 193 million pounds in 2019 and exceeds the 142 million pounds of projected production by about 51 million pounds (UxC 2019 Q3 UMO). This gap includes the 19 million pound per year impact from the indefinite shutdown of the worlds’ largest uranium mine in Canada as well as other producer shutdowns and production cuts. The WNA’s September 2019 Fuel Report noted “Rapid growth in uranium demand will lead to a need for additional mined uranium in the period to 2040 in all scenarios”. “Projections for nuclear generating capacity growth have been revised upwards for the first time in eight years, following the introduction of more favorable policies in a number of countries”.
 
While the difference between primary production and reactor demand is currently being filled with secondary market supplies, this is not a sustainable long-term supply source. Recent forecasts expect secondary sources to drop more than 30% annually, from 49 million pounds in 2019 to about 34 million pounds by 2024. While there are different estimates on timing, it is clear secondary supply (that includes inventory drawdown) will be insufficient to fill a projected supply-demand gap, and new production will be required. As this transition develops, the market will become more production driven as opposed to inventory driven.
 
The United States has the world’s largest nuclear fleet and produces about 30% of the globe’s nuclear generation. In 2018 electricity production from this fleet reached a new record high of 807.1 billion kilowatt-hours, accounting for about 20% of the U.S.’s total electrical generation (Energy Information Administration (“EIA”)) and about 55% of the nation’s clean air energy (Nuclear Energy Institute (“NEI”)). The operating U.S. reactor fleet stands at 97 reactors, with two new commercial reactors under construction (Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia). Questions remain regarding the longer-term future of the two partially built Summer units, but these reactors may eventually be completed with a consortium of Korean and U.S. companies expressing interest in taking over the cancelled project. While some U.S. reactors have been shut down prematurely, the overall generating capacity remains strong as a result of plant reactor uprate programs and license extensions.
 
Preserving the existing U.S. nuclear fleet is a priority for the industry and, increasingly, the federal government and individual states. President Trump has recently announced “an initiative to revive and expand the nuclear energy sector and directed a complete review of United States nuclear energy policy to help find new ways to revitalize this crucial energy resource”. The NEI notes a recent National Governors Association report key takeaway is “flawed energy markets do not recognize the benefits that nuclear power provides”. This has resulted in a “collaborative, state-level leadership from governors, state legislators, public service commissions and others to preserve their nuclear plants”. Illinois, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Arizona and Ohio have passed measures that will help level the playing field, enabling nuclear energy to continue providing the clean air and the highly reliable base load electricity for their energy supply. The State of Pennsylvania is also working on similar measures to preserve their nuclear plants.

Several actions taken by the U.S. federal government over the past couple of years have been constructive developments for the U.S. uranium mining industry. The Department of Interior included uranium as a “Critical Mineral”, vital to the nation’s economic and national security. U.S. Secretary of Energy, Perry, halted the Department of Energy’s uranium barter system that was introducing price insensitive supply into the market. In July of 2018 the Department of Commerce (“DOC”) launched a Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act investigation “to determine whether uranium imports threaten to impair national security”. The DOC concluded uranium is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances (primarily from “foreign state-owned enterprises, which have distorted global prices”) “as to threaten to impair the national security of the U.S.”. While the President did not agree the finding was consistent with Section 232, he did agree that “the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security”. As a result, the President established the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group (“NFWG”) comprised of various government agencies “to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production”. The NFWG report is due to the President by October 10, 2019. We view this action as having potential to accelerate already improving supply-demand fundamentals with near-term positive impacts for the U.S. uranium mining industry.
 
The U.S. is the world’s largest consumer of uranium with annual requirements of about 50 million pounds of U3O8. The EIA reported domestic mined production totaled 0.7 million pounds in 2018, down 37% from 2017. This continues to highlight the extreme U.S. over-dependency on foreign sources of uranium supply. In 2019 U.S. production is expected to drop to levels not seen since the dawn of the industry, over 70 years ago, to less than 1% of U.S. reactor requirements. This level of production is inconsistent with the President’s national security objectives and we believe increases the prospects that the NFWG will make recommendations to the President in-line with his mandates to revitalize and expand U.S. nuclear fuel production.
 
The uranium market suffered a long downturn after peaking in 2007 at $138 per pound U3O8 that was followed by a rebound and then a subsequent drop of about 75% from early 2011 into the 2016 low at $17.75 per pound. However, the tide appears to have turned with the spot market up over 40% since the 2016 low (through August of 2019). Global fundamentals are in process of rebalancing the uranium market and driving an improvement in the price of uranium. As outlined above, increased levels of production cuts from major producers, plus significant purchasing by producers to fill long-term supply contracts as well as fund buying, are all contributing to the upward movement in uranium prices.
 
Ultimately, the forces of supply and demand will dictate the uranium market’s future direction. While the market has clearly improved since the 2016 low, we still expect several major drivers to further bolster prices. Higher priced contracts that have supported production costs are continuing to roll out of producer and utility supply portfolios. These higher priced contracts are not replaceable with current market prices below production costs for the vast majority of producers. This will likely continue the trend of production cuts and deferrals until prices rise sufficiently to sustain long-term mining operations. On the demand side of that equation, further upside market pressure also appears likely to evolve as utilities return to a longer-term contracting cycle to replace expiring contracts. As these and other forces unfold the more recent inventory driven market is likely to wane, paving the way for a more production driven market. Lead times for new production typically range from seven to 10 years or longer. The market appears to be within the time frame required for investment to bring new supply online to meet those lead times. However, prices are not yet at levels that incentivize future production. All things considered, we believe the supply and demand fundamentals should continue to exert upward price pressure on uranium.
 
Titanium (TiO2) Industry Updates
 
During Fiscal 2019, the market fundamentals for titanium dioxide remained favorable. There is no economic substitute or environmentally safe alternative to titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is used in many "quality of life" products for which demand historically has been linked to global gross domestic product (“GDP), ongoing urbanization trends and discretionary spending. 95% of all the mined titanium feedstocks are used to manufacture pure titanium dioxides – a pigment that enhances brightness and opacity in paints, inks, paper, plastics, food products and cosmetics. The remaining 5% of supply is used in the production of titanium metal.
 
Demand for titanium feedstocks, such as ilmenite, is closely tied to titanium dioxide pigment demand. The global titanium pigment demand continued to be robust through the first half of calendar 2018, with ilmenite prices increasing, although at a slower pace than recorded during 2017.
 
Recent results reported by western pigment producers continue to confirm favorable market conditions, which should support ongoing high pigment plant utilization rates and feedstock offtakes through the coming quarters. In China, as in 2017, feedstock suppliers have been reporting some seasonal weakness in the ilmenite market over the summer months. This, coupled with the decline in pigment plant operating rates associated with the enforcement of stricter environmental regulations, has resulted in somewhat lower levels of ilmenite demand and the softening of ilmenite prices in this region.
 
 5



The longer-term supply and demand fundamentals may have significant potential, in our view, to keep upward pressure on high-quality feedstock prices. Major feedstock supplier deposits are reaching maturity and, as a result, a prominent analyst of the industry is forecasting a supply deficit in the absence of new supply. More specifically, Chinese domestic ilmenite is mainly unsuitable for processing under the stricter environmental regulations and, as such, the long-term global shift towards chloride pigment production will continue to drive overall high-quality feedstock demand and price.
 
In-Situ Recovery (ISR) Mining
 
We utilize or plan on utilizing in-situ recovery or ISR uranium mining for our South Texas projects, including the Palangana Mine, as well as our Reno Creek Project in Wyoming, and will continue to utilize ISR mining whenever such alternative is available to conventional mining.  When compared to conventional mining, ISR mining requires lower capital expenditures and has a reduced impact on the environment, as well as a shorter lead time to uranium recovery.
 
ISR mining involves circulating oxidized water through an underground uranium deposit, dissolving the uranium and then pumping the uranium-rich solution to the surface for processing. Oxidizing solution enters the formation through a series of injection wells and is drawn to a series of communicating extraction wells. To create a localized hydrologic cone of depression in each wellfield, more groundwater will be produced than injected. Under this gradient, the natural groundwater movement from the surrounding area is toward the wellfield, providing control of the injection fluid. Over-extraction is adjusted as necessary to maintain a cone of depression which ensures that the injection fluid does not move outside the permitted area.
 
The uranium-rich solution is pumped from an ore zone to the surface and circulated through a series of ion exchange columns located at the mine site.  The solution flows through resin beds inside an ion exchange column where the uranium bonds to small resin beads.  As the solution exits the ion exchange column, it is mostly void of uranium and is re-circulated back to the wellfield and through the ore zone.  Once the resin beads are fully-loaded with uranium, they are transported by truck to the Hobson Processing Facility and transferred to a tank for flushing with a brine solution, or elution, which strips the uranium from the resin beads. The stripped resin beads are then transported back to the mine and reused in the ion exchange columns.  The uranium solution, now free from the resin, is precipitated out and concentrated into a slurry mixture and fed to a filter press to remove unwanted solids and contaminants.  The slurry is then dried in a zero-emissions rotary vacuum dryer, packed in metal drums and shipped out as uranium concentrates, or yellowcake, to ConverDyn for storage and sales.
 
Each project is divided into a mining unit, known as a Production Area Authorization (“PAA”), which lies inside an approved Mine Permit Boundary. Each PAA will be developed, extracted and restored as one unit and will have its own set of monitor wells. It is common to have multiple PAAs in extraction at any one time with additional units in various states of exploration, pre-extraction and/or restoration.
 
After mining is complete in a PAA, aquifer restoration will begin as soon as practicable and will continue until the groundwater is restored to pre-mining conditions. Once restoration is complete, a stability period of no less than one year is scheduled with quarterly baseline and monitor well sampling. Wellfield reclamation will follow after aquifer restoration is complete and the stability period has passed.
 
Hobson Processing Facility
 
The Hobson Processing Facility is located in Karnes County, Texas, about 100 miles northwest of Corpus Christi.  It was originally licensed and constructed in 1978, serving as the hub for several satellite mining projects until 1996, and completely refurbished in 2008. On December 18, 2009, we acquired the Hobson Processing Facility as part of our acquisition of STMV.
 
With a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U3O8 annually, and licensed to process up to one million pounds of U3O8 annually, our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our “hub-and-spoke” strategy in the State of Texas, specifically in the South Texas Uranium Belt, where we utilize ISR mining.

Palangana Mine
 
We hold various mining lease and surface use agreements generally having an initial five-year term with extension provisions, granting us the exclusive right to explore, develop and mine for uranium at the Palangana Mine, a 6,987-acre property located in Duval County, Texas, approximately 100 miles south of the Hobson Processing Facility. These agreements are subject to certain royalty and overriding royalty interests indexed to the sale price of uranium.
 
On December 18, 2009, we acquired the Palangana Mine as part of our acquisition of STMV. In November 2010, the Palangana Mine commenced uranium extraction utilizing ISR mining and in January 2011 the Hobson Processing Facility began processing resins received from the Palangana Mine.
 
Material Relationships Including Long-Term Delivery Contracts
 
At July 31, 2019, we had no uranium supply or “off-take” agreements in place.
 
Given that there are up to approximately 60 different companies as potential buyers in the uranium market, we are not substantially dependent upon any single customer to purchase the uranium extracted by us. 
Seasonality
 
The timing of our uranium concentrate sales is dependent upon factors such as extraction results from our mining activities, cash requirements, contractual requirements and perception of the uranium market. As a result, our sales are neither tied to nor dependent upon any particular season. In addition, our ability to extract and process uranium does not change on a seasonal basis. Over the past ten years uranium prices have tended to decline during the calendar third quarter before rebounding during the fourth quarter, but there does not appear to be a strong correlation.
Mineral Rights
 
In Texas our mineral rights are held exclusively through private leases from the owners of the land/mineral/surface rights with varying terms. In general, these leases provide for uranium and certain other specified mineral rights only including surface access rights for an initial term of five years and renewal for a second five-year term. Burke Hollow and some of our Goliad leases have a fixed royalty amount based on net proceeds from sales of uranium, and other projects have production royalties calculated on a sliding-scale basis tied to the gross sales price of uranium. Remediation of the property is required in accordance with regulatory standards, which may include the posting of reclamation bonds.
 
In Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming our mineral rights are held either exclusively or through a combination of federal mining claims and state and private mineral leases. Remediation of the property is required in accordance with regulatory standards, which may include the posting of reclamation bonds. Our federal mining claims consist of both unpatented lode and placer mining claims registered with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and the appropriate counties. These claims provide for all mineral rights including surface access rights for an indefinite period. Annual maintenance requirements include BLM claim fees of $155 ($165 for payments beginning this year) per claim due yearly on September 1. Our state mineral leases are registered with their respective states. These leases provide for all mineral rights, including surface access rights, subject to a production royalty of 4% in Wyoming and 5% to 6% in Arizona, ranging from a five-year term in Arizona to a ten-year term in Wyoming. Annual maintenance requirements include lease fees of $1 and $3 per acre and minimum exploration expenditure requirements of $10 and $20 per acre in Arizona. Our private mineral leases are negotiated directly with the owners of the land/mineral/surface rights with varying terms. These leases provide for uranium and certain other specified mineral rights only, including surface access rights, subject to production royalties, ranging from an initial term of five to seven years and renewal for a second five-year to seven-year term, and some of which have an initial term of 20 years.
 
Under the mining laws of Saskatchewan, Canada, title to mineral rights for our Diabase Project is held through The Crown Minerals Act of the Province of Saskatchewan. In addition, The Mineral Resources Act, 1985 and The Mineral Tenure Registry Regulations affect the rights and administration of mineral tenure in Saskatchewan. The Diabase Project lands are currently claimed as “Crown dispositions” or “mineral dispositions”. Subject to section 19 of The Crown Minerals Act, a claim grants to the holder the exclusive right to explore for any Crown minerals that are subject to these regulations within the claim lands. Claims are renewed annually and the claim holder is required to satisfy work expenditure requirements. Expenditure requirements are $nil for the first year, $15 per hectare for the second year to the tenth year of assessment work periods and $25 per hectare for the eleventh year and subsequent assessment work periods. For registering exploration expenditures mineral dispositions maybe be grouped at the time of submission if the total mineral disposition area is not greater than 18,000 hectares. The holder may also submit a cash payment or cash deposit in lieu of a work assessment submission for not more than three consecutive work periods. A claim may be converted to a mineral lease upon application and payment of a registration fee.

Under the mining laws of the Republic of Paraguay, title to mineral rights for the Yuty Project is held through a “Mineral Concession Contract” approved by the National Congress and signed between the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and the Company, and titles to mineral rights for the Oviedo Project and the Alto Paraná Titanium Project are held through “Exploration Mining Permits” granted by the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (“MOPC”), the mining regulator in Paraguay. These mineral rights provide for the exploration of metallic and non-metallic minerals and precious and semi-precious gems within the territory of Paraguay for up to a six-year period, and for the exploitation of minerals for a minimum period of 20 years from the beginning of the production phase, extendable for an additional ten years.
 
During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we have had communications and filings with the MOPC, whereby the MOPC is taking the position that certain concessions forming part of the Company’s Yuty and Alto Paraná Titanium Projects are not eligible for extension as to exploration or continuation to exploitation in their current stages.  While we remain fully committed to our development path forward in Paraguay, we caused our legal counsel to file an appeal with the Administrative Courts in Paraguay to reverse the MOPC’s position in order to protect our continuing rights in those concessions.

--+---------------------------------------

 
The Alto Paraná Titanium Project is a 174,200-acre property held under five exploration mining permits located in Paraguay. The Alto Paraná Titanium Project is subject to 1.5% net smelter returns royalty. We have the right, exercisable at any time for a period of six years following the acquisition of the project, to acquire 0.5% of the royalty at a purchase price of $500,000.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Our activities will be subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Our operations will be subject to stringent environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Railroad Commission of Texas (“RCT”), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).
 
In Texas surface extraction and exploration for uranium is regulated by the RCT, while ISR uranium extraction is regulated by the TCEQ. An exploration permit is the initial permit granted by the RCT that authorizes exploration drilling activities inside an approved area. This permit authorizes specific drilling and plugging activities requiring documentation for each borehole drilled. All documentation is submitted to the RCT on a monthly basis and each borehole drilled under the exploration permit is inspected by an RCT inspector to ensure compliance. At July 31, 2019, we held one exploration permit in each of Bee, Duval and Goliad counties.
 
Before ISR uranium extraction can begin in Texas, a number of permits must be granted by the TCEQ.

A Mine Area Permit application is required for submission to the TCEQ to establish a specific permit area boundary, aquifer exemption boundary and the mineral zones of interests or production zones. The application also includes a financial surety plan to ensure funding for all plugging and abandonment requirements. Funding for surety is in the form of cash or bonds, including an excess of 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2019, we held Mine Area Permits for the Palangana Mine, the Goliad Project and the Burke Hollow Project.
 
A Radioactive Material License (“RML”) application is also required for submission to the TCEQ for authorization to operate a uranium recovery facility. The application includes baseline environmental data for soil, vegetation, surface water and groundwater along with operational sampling frequencies and locations. A Radiation Safety Manual is a key component of the application which defines the environmental health and safety programs and procedures to protect employees and the environment. Another important component of the application is a financial surety mechanism to ensure plant and wellfield decommissioning is properly funded and maintained. Surety funding is in the form of cash or bonds and includes an excess of 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2019, we held RMLs for the Palangana Mine, the Burke Hollow Project, the Goliad Project and the Hobson Processing Facility.
 
PAA applications are also required for submission to the TCEQ to establish specific extraction areas inside the Mine Area Permit boundary. These are typically 30 to 100-acre units that have been delineated and contain producible quantities of uranium. The PAA application includes baseline water quality data that is characteristic of that individual unit, proposes upper control limits for monitor well analysis and establishes restoration values. The application will also include a financial security plan for wellfield restoration and reclamation which must be funded and in place prior to commencing uranium extraction. At July 31, 2019, we held four PAA permits for the Palangana Mine and one for the Goliad Project.
 
A Class I disposal well permit application is also required for submission to the TCEQ for authorization for deep underground wastewater injection. It is the primary method for disposing of excess fluid from the extraction areas and for reverse osmosis concentrate during the restoration phase. This permit authorizes injection into a specific injection zone within a designated injection interval. The permit requires continuous monitoring of numerous parameters including injection flow rate, injection pressure, annulus pressure and injection/annulus differential pressure. Mechanical integrity testing is required initially and annually to ensure the well is mechanically sound. Surety funding for plugging and abandonment of each well is in the form of cash or bonds, including 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2019, we held two Class I disposal well permits for each of the Hobson Processing Facility, the Palangana Satellite Facility, the Burke Hollow Project and the Goliad Project.
 
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) creates a regulatory program to protect groundwater and is administered by the EPA.  The SDWA allows states to issue underground injection control (“UIC”) permits under two conditions: the state’s program must have been granted primacy; and the EPA must have granted an aquifer exemption upon the state’s request.  Texas, being a primacy state, is therefore authorized to grant UIC permits and makes the official requests for an aquifer exemption to the EPA.  The aquifer exemption request is submitted by the Company to the TCEQ and, once approved, is then submitted by the TCEQ to the EPA for concurrence and final issuance.  At July 31, 2019, we held an aquifer exemption for the Palangana Mine, the Goliad Project and the Burke Hollow Project.
Waste Disposal
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes affect minerals exploration and production activities by imposing regulations on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” and on the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
 
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (collectively, “Hazardous Substances”). These classes of persons or potentially responsible parties include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility or property where there is or has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the Hazardous Substances found at such a facility. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs of such action. We may also in the future become an owner of facilities on which Hazardous Substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may in the future be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities or property at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages.
Air Emissions
 
Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed permitting requirements. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources. In Texas the TCEQ issues an exemption for those processes that meet the criteria for low to zero emission by issuing a Permit by Rule. Presently the Palangana Mine, the Hobson Processing Facility and the Goliad Project all have Permits by Rule covering air emissions.
Clean Water Act
 
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes, including mineral processing wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters. The CWA provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and other pollutants. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and costs. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Competition
 
The uranium industry is highly competitive, and our competition includes larger, more established companies with longer operating histories that not only explore for and produce uranium but also market uranium and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Due to their greater financial and technical resources, we may not be able to acquire additional uranium projects in a competitive bidding process involving such companies. Additionally, these larger companies have greater resources to continue with their operations during periods of depressed market conditions.
 
The global titanium market is highly competitive, with the top six producers accounting for approximately 60% of the world’s production capacity according to TZ Minerals International Pty. Ltd. Competition is based on a number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Among our competitors are companies that are vertically-integrated (those that have their own raw material resources).
