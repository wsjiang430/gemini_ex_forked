ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL 
 Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our) is a publicly traded investment management firm whose primary business activity is managing, servicing, and marketing a family of open-end mutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. We are committed to employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing and to providing superior service to investors. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Our firm was founded on these principles over 30 years ago, and the same principles guide us today. 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with each funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), conducting investment research, monitoring compliance with each funds investment restrictions and applicable laws and regulations, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors and monitoring such sub-advisors investment performance and adherence to investment policies and compliance procedures, overseeing other service providers, maintaining public relations and marketing programs for each fund, preparing and distributing regulatory reports, and overseeing distribution through third-party financial intermediaries. Shareholder services include maintaining an 800 number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about the funds or their accounts or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. The fees we receive for investment advisory and shareholder services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our total revenue increases or decreases as our average assets under management rises or falls. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies from fund to fund, but the percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all funds. 
 We have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In exchange for these sub-advisory services, we pay each sub-advisor a fee out of our own assets, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised funds. Accordingly, the sub-advisory fees we pay increase or decrease as our average assets under management in our sub-advised funds increases or decreases, respectively. 
 Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2019 was $5.2 billion. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, our total assets under management was $4.9 billion, an increase of over 1,200% from $375 million as of the end of fiscal year 2002, which was our first fiscal year as a public company. 
 Our business strategy centers on (i) organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and (ii) growth through strategic purchases of management-related assets.

 Multi-Asset Funds
Three of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Multi-Asset products. Of those three funds, two utilize a quantitative investment strategy and one is actively managed. These funds follow a more conservative investment strategy focused on generating income and providing an alternative to mutual funds containing only equity stocks. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Multi-Asset product category: 
 

 | Hennessy Total Return Fund (Investor Class symbol HDOGX). The Hennessy Total Return Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing approximately 50% of its assets in the 10 highest dividend-yielding common stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (commonly referred to as the Dogs of the Dow) and the remaining 50% of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. This fund then utilizes a borrowing strategy that allows the funds performance to approximate what it would be if the fund had an asset allocation of roughly 75% Dogs of the Dow stocks and 25% U.S. Treasury securities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Hennessy Balanced Fund seeks a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing approximately 50% of its assets in the Dogs of the Dow stocks and approximately 50% of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year.

The Hennessy BP Energy Fund seeks total return by investing primarily in companies operating in a capacity related to the supply, transportation, production, transmission, or demand of energy, also known as the energy value chain.

 | Hennessy Japan Fund (Investor Class symbol HJPNX; Institutional Class symbol HJPIX).

 Development of New Investment Strategies and Expanding Our Product Offerings 
 We develop new investment strategies and expand our product offerings by identifying client needs and reviewing asset allocation tables to determine where we can augment our family of mutual funds. Once we identify an attractive market segment, we select one of the following methods to initiate the new strategy: 

 | We screen the appropriate universe of stocks with a set of parameters that we believe identifies stocks that will produce higher long-term returns with lower associated risk than their relative indices, and we then introduce the new investment strategy into the marketplace by opening and directly marketing a new mutual fund;

 ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SOURCES OF REVENUES, AND 12B-1 PLANS 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds. The fees we receive for these services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. In addition, the sub-advisory fees that we pay are also calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised Hennessy Funds. The amount of our assets under management fluctuates as a result of organic inflows (purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds by new or existing shareholders), acquisition inflows, outflows (redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds by shareholders), and market appreciation or depreciation.

Investment Advisory Agreements and Fees

The services that we provide to each Hennessy Fund pursuant to these investment advisory agreements include, among other things, the following: 

 | acting as portfolio manager for the fund or overseeing the sub-advisor acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the funds portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund;

 The investment advisory agreements also provide that we are responsible for performing any ordinary clerical and bookkeeping services needed by the Hennessy Funds that are not provided by the funds custodian, administrator, or transfer agent. The Funds Board of Trustees comprises three trustees who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds (the disinterested trustees) and Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a majority of the trustees must be disinterested trustees, and the disinterested trustees must approve entering into and continuing our investment advisory agreements. The disinterested trustees also have sole responsibility for selecting and nominating other disinterested trustees. 
 
15 


 In exchange for the services described above, we receive an investment advisory fee from each Hennessy Fund that is calculated as a percentage of such funds average daily net asset value. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, the percentages of each funds assets used to calculate the annual investment advisory fees payable to us are as follows: 
 

Hennessy Fund (All Class Shares) | Investment Advisory Fee(as a % of fund assets) | 
Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund | | 0.74 | %
Hennessy Focus Fund | | 0.90 | %
Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund | | 0.74 | %
Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund | | 0.74 | %
Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund | | 0.74 | %
Hennessy Total Return Fund | | 0.60 | %
Hennessy Equity and Income Fund | | 0.80 | %
Hennessy Balanced Fund | | 0.60 | %
Hennessy BP Energy Fund | | 1.25 | %
Hennessy BP Midstream Fund | | 1.10 | %
Hennessy Gas Utility Fund | | 0.40 | %
Hennessy Japan Fund | | 0.80 | %
Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund | | 0.80 | %
Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund | | 0.90 | %
Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund | | 0.90 | %
Hennessy Technology Fund | | 0.74 | %

 We waive a portion of our fees with respect to the Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund, the Hennessy BP Midstream Fund, and the Hennessy Technology Fund to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to our revenues. The waived fees are deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduce the aggregate amount of advisory fees we receive from such fund in the subsequent month. To date, we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but we have the ability to waive fees at our discretion. Any decision to waive fees would only apply on a going-forward basis. 
 Our investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (i) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (ii) the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If the investment advisory agreements are not renewed annually as described above, they terminate automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which the investment advisory agreements would terminate. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if we assign it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the transfer of our common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, either the applicable Hennessy Fund or we may terminate an investment advisory agreement by providing notice to the other party 60 days prior to the expiration of such agreement. 
 Sub-Advisory Agreements and Fees 
 We have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In each case, the sub-advisor entity or the individuals working at the sub-advisor entity is the same entity or are the same individuals who advised the fund prior to our purchase of the assets related to the management of such fund. The provision of sub-advisory services must be in accordance with the applicable Hennessy Funds sub-advisory agreement, Prospectus, and Statement of Additional Information. The services that each sub-advisor provides to the applicable Hennessy Fund pursuant to the terms of the sub-advisory agreement include, among other things, the following: 
 

 | acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the funds portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the funds investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the funds portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16 


 
 | ensuring that its compliance programs include policies and procedures relevant to the fund and the sub-advisors duties as a portfolio manager to the fund;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | for each annual report of the fund, preparing a written summary of the funds performance for the most recent 12-month period; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | providing a quarterly certification to Funds Board of Trustees regarding trading and allocation practices, supervisory matters, the sub-advisors compliance program (including its code of ethics), compliance with the funds policies, and general firm updates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In exchange for sub-advisory services, we pay sub-advisory fees to the sub-advisors out of our own assets. Sub-advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable funds average daily net asset value. The following table lists each of our sub-advised funds, the sub-advisor for such fund, and the percentage used to calculate the annual sub-advisory fees payable by us to such funds sub-advisor as of the end of fiscal year 2019: 
 

Hennessy Fund (All Class Shares) | | Sub-Advisor | | Sub-Advisory Fee(as a % of fund assets) 
Hennessy Focus Fund | | Broad Run Investment Management, LLC | | 0.29% 
Hennessy Equity and Income Fund | | FCI Advisors (fixed income allocation) | | 0.27% 
 | The London Company of Virginia, LLC(equity allocation) | | 0.33%
Hennessy BP Energy Fund | | BP Capital Fund Advisors, LLC | | 0.40% 
Hennessy BP Midstream Fund | | BP Capital Fund Advisors, LLC | | 0.40% 
Hennessy Japan Fund | | SPARX Asset Management Co., Ltd. | | $0-$500 million: Above $500 million-$1 billion: Above $1 billion: | 0.35% 0.40% 0.42%
Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund | | SPARX Asset Management Co., Ltd. | | $0-$500 million: Above $500 million-$1 billion: Above $1 billion: | 0.35% 0.40% 0.42%

 The sub-advisory agreements must be renewed annually in the same manner as the investment advisory agreements and are subject to the same termination provisions. 
 Shareholder Servicing Agreements and Fees 
 Pursuant to a shareholder servicing agreement with Hennessy Funds Trust, we provide shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds including, among other things, maintaining an 800 number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about the funds or their accounts, or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. In exchange for these services, we receive a shareholder service fee from each Hennessy Fund of 0.10% of the average daily net assets of such funds Investor Class shares. 
 
17 


 12b-1 Plans 
 All of the Hennessy Funds have adopted a 12b-1 plan. These plans are named after Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which permits a mutual fund to adopt a plan that allows the fund to collect fees to use to make payments to third parties in connection with the distribution of fund shares. Amounts paid under a plan may be spent on any activities or expenses primarily intended to result in sale of shares of the fund, including, but not limited to (i) advertising, (ii) compensation paid to financial institutions, broker-dealers, and others for sales and marketing, (iii) shareholder accounting servicing, (iv) printing and mailing prospectuses to possible new shareholders, and (v) printing and mailing sales literature. A mutual fund may also employ a distributor to distribute and market fund shares and then use 12b-1 fees to pay the distributor for expenses relating to telephone use, overhead, employing employees who engage in or support the distribution of the fund shares, printing prospectuses and other reports for possible new shareholders, advertising, and preparing and distributing sales literature. 
 The 12b-1 fee for each Hennessy Fund is 0.15% of such funds average daily net assets. 
 CUSTODIAL, DISTRIBUTION, AND BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS 
 A third-party and one of its affiliates acts as custodian and distributor for all of our assets under management. 
 All trades for the Hennessy Funds are executed by independent brokerage firms following our direction or the direction of our sub-advisors. When selecting brokers, we and our sub-advisors are required to seek best execution. Although there is no single statutory definition, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) releases and other legal guidelines make clear that this duty requires us to seek the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for a customers account. The lowest possible commission, while important, is not the sole determinative factor. We and our sub-advisors also consider factors such as order size and market depth, availability of competing markets and liquidity, trading characteristics of the security, financial responsibility of the broker-dealer, and the brokers ability to address current market conditions. 
 Currently, we participate in soft dollar arrangements with one of our brokers. This means we receive research reports and real-time electronic research to assist us in trading and managing the Hennessy Funds. Under these soft dollar arrangements, the Hennessy Funds pay brokerage commissions for securities trades at the regular market rate, and some or all of the value of those commissions is received by us in the form of research or other services that benefit the Hennessy Funds. We believe our soft dollar arrangements comply with SEC guidance regarding soft dollars. 
 LICENSE AGREEMENT 
 Our ability to use the names and formulaic investment strategies of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund are governed by the terms and conditions of a license agreement, dated as of April 10, 2000, with Netfolio. Under the license agreement, Netfolio granted us a perpetual, paid-up, royalty-free, exclusive license to use certain trademarks, such as Strategy Indexing, Cornerstone Growth, and Cornerstone Value, as well as the formula investment strategies used by the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund. All of our advertising, marketing, promotional, and other materials incorporating or referring to the trademarks are subject to the prior written approval of Netfolio, except that we do not need Netfolios prior written approval to use the trademarks in a manner that is not substantially unchanged from any prior use by Netfolio in its own business or from any prior use by us previously approved by Netfolio. We have the right to assign the license to another person or entity if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the license agreement. There are no ongoing licensing fees associated with this license agreement, and Netfolio does not have any contractual rights to terminate the license agreement.

 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 From the time we launched our first mutual fund in 1996, we have consistently pursued a growth strategy centered on organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and growth through strategic purchases of management-related assets. The implementation of this business strategy is described below. 
 

 | Seeking to deliver strong investment performance of the Hennessy Funds
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 One of the most effective ways we can grow the assets of the Hennessy Funds is by delivering strong investment performance, which we believe should: 
 

 | result in an increase in the value of existing assets of the Hennessy Funds;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | encourage more investors to buy shares of the Hennessy Funds and decrease the number of investors who redeem their shares and leave the Hennessy Funds; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | motivate current investors to invest additional money in the Hennessy Funds.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Utilizing our branding and marketing campaign to attract assets
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we can attract investors to the Hennessy Funds by effectively marketing our consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. We offer quantitative funds, actively managed funds, and income-generating funds. We believe our quantitative funds will attract investors who want to understand exactly how their investments are managed and who favor statistical analysis and empirical evidence as the basis for investment decisions. We also believe that our actively managed funds will attract investors who appreciate a fundamental, hands-on investment management approach and talented portfolio managers. Finally, we believe our more conservative, income-generating funds will attract investors seeking alternatives to mutual funds invested entirely in equities. 
 We run a comprehensive and far-reaching public relations program designed to disseminate our message to a wide variety of potential investors through frequent television appearances, radio spots, feature articles, and print media mentions. We have partnered with an industry-leading public relations firm, SunStar Strategic, to proactively promote the Hennessy Funds to national financial media. This public relations program has consistently resulted in the Hennessy Funds being mentioned an average of once every two to three days in national print and broadcast media such as CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg radio and TV, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger, and Barrons, among others. To facilitate our presence in the media, we utilize LiveStudio, an in-house studio providing a direct link to media broadcasts, at our office in Novato, California. Along with our primary spokesperson, Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors and President, Chief Investment Officer, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, we also utilize David Ellison, Ryan Kelley and Josh Wein, all Portfolio Managers of the Hennessy Funds, as well as our sub-advisors, to further expand our public relations program and provide comprehensive media coverage of our products. 
 We maintain and regularly update a robust website. We also utilize more focused marketing efforts, such as sending informational and promotional communications, fund performance updates, news articles pertaining to the Hennessy Funds, and portfolio manager commentaries to investors and prospective investors. We also participate in exhibitions at select investment advisor trade shows throughout the year. Additionally, we attend strategic industry-related conferences and participate as moderators or guest speakers on industry-related panels whenever the opportunity arises.

 | Expanding our distribution network to additional distribution platforms
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investors may purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds through financial intermediaries, including mutual fund supermarkets, national wirehouses and broker-dealers, independent and regional broker-dealers, and registered investment advisors, or directly from the Hennessy Funds. 
 Mutual fund supermarkets, such as Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Pershing, generally offer funds of many different investment companies to investors in exchange for a services fee paid by the applicable fund or that funds investment advisor. The ability to purchase various mutual funds in a single location is very attractive to investors, and the majority of our $4.9 billion of assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2019 was held at mutual fund supermarkets. Additionally, we continually seek opportunities to form new relationships with financial intermediaries to make our no-load mutual funds even more accessible to investors. We oversee distribution of the Hennessy Funds through all financial intermediaries. 
 Investors may also purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds directly through the Hennessy Funds website or by calling us or U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator. 
 

 | Increasing our current base of financial advisors and investment professionals
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investment professionals generally have access to a wide variety of investment products they may recommend to their investors. A recommendation by an investment professional to an investor to buy one of the Hennessy Funds may greatly influence that investor. Thus, we believe that expanding our current base of investment professionals who utilize no-load funds for their investors will help us increase our assets under management, which will in turn increase our revenues. 
 

 | Securing participation on the platforms of national full-service firms
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continually strive to develop relationships with national full-service firms that permit their investment professionals to offer no-load funds to their investors as a way to increase the amount of assets that we manage, which will in turn increase our revenues. 
 

 | Pursuing strategic purchases of management agreements for additional mutual funds
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A primary component of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional mutual funds. We believe the regulatory burden imposed upon the mutual fund industry, along with increased competition, has compressed the margins of smaller to mid-sized mutual fund managers, making those managers more receptive to an asset purchase. We believe that we are well prepared to benefit from these attractive asset purchase trends and from the increasing supply of potential targets. In addition, we believe there are a number of attractive asset purchase opportunities from mutual fund managers who are reaching retirement age or who are leaving the mutual fund management arena. We have generally been able to offer lower overall expense ratios to the shareholders of purchased funds. In some instances, we have also been able to improve performance. 
 Through our asset purchase strategy, we have completed 10 purchases of the assets related to the management of mutual funds over a 19-year period, integrating $4.3 billion in net assets of 30 different mutual funds into the Hennessy Funds family. We completed our most recent asset purchase on October 26, 2018, when we purchased the assets related to the management of the BP Capital TwinLine Energy Fund and the BP Capital TwinLine MLP Fund (together, the BP Funds). This asset purchase added nearly $200 million to our assets under management. Upon completion of the transaction, the assets related to the management of the BP Funds were reorganized into two new series of Hennessy Funds Trust called the Hennessy BP Energy Fund and the Hennessy BP Midstream Fund, respectively. In connection with the transaction, BP Capital Fund Advisors, LLC, the investment advisor to the BP Funds, became the sub-advisor to the Hennessy BP Energy Fund and the Hennessy BP Midstream Fund.

 | Delivering strong, high-quality financial results.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 We seek to maintain a strong financial position and to manage our investment advisory business to meet the highest regulatory, ethical, and business standards and to maintain continuity of service to all of the investors in the Hennessy Funds. 
 COMPETITION 
 The investment advisory industry is highly competitive, with new competitors continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, savings and loans associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current investor relationships, as well as to create new ones, will be successful. To grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Key competitive factors include: 

 | the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds;
--+------------------------------------------


 | the array of our product offerings;
--+------------------------------------


 | industry rankings of the Hennessy Funds;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | the quality of our services;
--+-----------------------------


 | our ability to further develop and market our brand;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | our commitment to placing the interests of investors first; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | our general business reputation.
--+---------------------------------

 Increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with other risk factors that we discuss in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 We are subject to an increasing number of extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect shareholders of mutual funds and investors of registered investment advisors. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 We are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and, therefore, must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to investors, transactions with investors, compliance program effectiveness, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping and reporting, disclosure, and anti-fraud matters.

 We manage accounts for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis, meaning that we have the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. 
 Our mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes additional obligations on both the Hennessy Funds and us, as the advisor to the Hennessy Funds, including detailed operational requirements. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business, affairs, and investment portfolios of the Hennessy Funds, our operations are subject to oversight and management by the Funds Board of Trustees. The responsibilities of the Funds Board of Trustees include, among other things, annually approving the continuation of our investment advisory agreements and shareholder servicing agreement with the Hennessy Funds and our sub-advisory agreements with the sub-advisors to the Hennessy Funds, approving other service providers, determining the method of valuing assets, and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. The Investment Company Act of 1940 also imposes on us a fiduciary duty with respect to receiving investment advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action, or through litigation initiated by investors in the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a private right of action. 
 The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censures to the suspension of individual employees to termination of our registration as an investment advisor. A violation of applicable law or regulations could also subject us, our directors, and our employees to civil actions brought by private parties. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements.
