DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Our principal offices are located at A-07-01, Block A, Level 7, Sky Park One City, Jalan USJ 25/1, 47650 Subang Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan.
 
We are an exploration stage company engaged in the business of acquiring mineral exploration rights throughout Asia, exploring for commercially producible quantities of minerals, and exploiting any mineral deposits we discover that demonstrate economic feasibility. Since we are an exploration stage company, there is no assurance that commercially exploitable reserves of valuable minerals exist on any property that we now own or may own in the future. We will need to do further exploration before a final evaluation of the economic and legal feasibility of our future exploration is determined.
 
We are presently seeking to acquire mineral exploration rights. Such rights will likely be in the form of an option on patented or unpatented mineral claims prospective for precious metals or ore minerals in Asia. Upon acquiring such mineral exploration rights, we will require financing to explore the underlying claims to determine if they contain commercially producible quantities of precious metals or ore minerals. We will be unable to estimate the cost of such exploration until we know the size and location of the property underlying our mineral rights. We expect that such exploration costs will typically consist of fees to be paid for consulting services connected with exploration, the cost of rock sampling (the collection of a series of small chips over a measured distance, which is then submitted for a chemical analysis, usually to determine the metallic content over the sampled interval, a pre-determined location(s) on the property), and cost of analyzation of these samples. There is no assurance that we will be able to locate a suitable exploration property, or that if we do, it will contain commercially producible quantities of minerals.
 
If we discover significant quantities of precious metals or mineral ores on any property underlying our mineral rights, we will begin technical and economic feasibility studies to determine if we have reserves. We will not be able to estimate the cost of such feasibility studies until we know the size and location of the property. We will only consider developing a property if we have proven reserves of precious metals or mineral ores that can be profitably extracted.
 
Any work that would be conducted on a property would be conducted by unaffiliated independent contractors that we will hire. The independent contractors will be responsible for surveying, geology, engineering, exploration, and excavation. The professional engineers and geologists we engage will evaluate the information derived from the exploration and excavation, and will advise us on the economic feasibility of removing the mineralized material.
 
We intend to seek out prospective mineral exploration properties by retaining the services of professional mining geologists. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not selected a geologist. We are initially focusing our exploration efforts in the Asia.
 
Any mineral property to be considered for acquisition will require due diligence by our management. Due diligence would likely include financial due diligence review and purchase investigation costs such as professional fees charged by consulting geologists, preparation of geological reports on properties, title searches and travel costs associated with on-site inspections. During this period, we would also need to maintain our periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and would incur legal and accounting costs. In the event that our available capital is insufficient to acquire an additional mineral property and sustain minimum operations, we would need to secure additional funding.

The focus of our exploration activities will be gold and other precious metals. While it is possible that a mineral property we acquire may host a commercially viable ore deposit suitable for production, we plan to option or sell any ore bodies that we may discover to a major mining company. Many major mining companies obtain their ore reserves through the purchase of ore bodies found by junior exploration companies. Although these major mining companies do some exploration work themselves, many of them rely on the junior resource exploration companies to provide them with future deposits for them to mine. We expect that optioning or selling a deposit found by us to these major mining companies will yield available capital to fund operations, while avoiding the substantial cost and investment horizon involved in mineral property development.
 
The success of our mineral exploration will depend upon finding commercially producible quantities of minerals, which are mineral deposits that have been identified through appropriate spaced drilling or underground sampling as having sufficient tonnage and average grade of metals to profitably remove them.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire a mineral property that has commercially producible quantities of any mineral, or that we will discover them if they exist. If we are unable to find reserves of valuable minerals, or if we cannot remove the minerals because we either do not have the capital to do so, or because it is not economically feasible to do so, we may be forced to sell or abandon our mineral interests or to cease our exploration activities altogether.
 
We do not presently own or have any rights to a mineral property. We have no reserves of any type of mineral.
 
GEOLOGICAL AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS
 
Since our management is inexperienced with exploration, we intend to retain qualified persons on a contract basis as needed to assist us with our exploration activities, including the survey, exploration, and excavation of any mineral property we may acquire. We do not presently have any verbal or written agreement regarding the retention of any such persons, and we do not intend to retain anyone until we have completed this annual report.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are a very early stage mineral exploration company and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint venture partners. Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration supplies.
REGULATIONS
 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations in Asia, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We intend to secure all necessary permits for exploration and, if development is warranted on a property, we will file final plans of operation before we start any mining operations.
 
Our activities are also subject to various federal and state/provincial laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We intend to conduct business with a view to safeguarding public health and the environment and operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Changes to current state/provincial or federal laws and regulations in Asia could in the future require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
We currently have no employees other than our directors. We intend to retain the services of geologists, prospectors and consultants on a contract basis to conduct the exploration programs on our mineral claims and to assist with regulatory compliance and preparation of financial statements.
