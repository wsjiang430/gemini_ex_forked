ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
El Pollo Loco is a differentiated and growing restaurant concept that specializes in fire-grilling citrus-marinated chicken and operates in the limited service restaurant (“LSR”) segment. We strive to offer the quality of food and dining experience typical of fast casual restaurants while providing the speed, convenience, and value typical of traditional quick-service restaurants (“QSRs”), a combination that we call “QSR+.” Our distinctive menu features our signature product—citrus-marinated fire-grilled chicken—and a variety of Mexican-inspired entrees that we create from our chicken. Every day in every restaurant, we marinate and fire-grill our chicken over open flames, and slice whole tomatoes, avocados, serrano peppers, and cilantro to make our salsas, guacamole, and cilantro dressings from scratch. The design of our kitchens reveals our Mexican-inspired cooking process and allows our customers to watch our Grill Masters and team members fire-grill and hand-cut our signature chicken, as well as team members make burritos, salads, tostadas, bowls, stuffed quesadillas, and chicken entrees.
We offer our customers healthier alternatives to traditional food on the go, served by our team members in a colorful, bright, and contemporary restaurant environment. We serve individual and family-sized chicken meals, a variety of Mexican-inspired entrees, and sides, and, throughout the year, on a limited-time basis, additional proteins like shrimp. Our entrees include favorites such as our Chicken Avocado Burrito, Under 500 Calorie entrees, Double Pollo Bowl, and Stuffed Chicken Avocado Quesadilla. Our famous Creamy Cilantro dressings and salsas are prepared fresh daily, allowing our customers to create their favorite flavor profiles to enhance their culinary experience. Our distinctive menu with healthier alternatives appeals to consumers across a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds and drives our balanced composition of sales throughout the day (our “day-part mix”), including at lunch and dinner.
El Pollo Loco is Spanish for “The Crazy Chicken.” We were organized as a Delaware corporation in 2005. We opened our first location on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, California, in 1980, and have grown our restaurant system to 484 restaurants, comprised of 213 company-operated and 271 franchised restaurants as of December 26, 2018. Our restaurants are located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Louisiana. Our typical restaurant is a free-standing building with drive-thru service that ranges in size from 2,200 to 3,000 square feet with seating for approximately 50-70 people.
The Company operates in one operating segment. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and expenses for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, and our total assets as of the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017, is included in our "Audited Consolidated Financial Statements" and accompanying "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in this Annual Report, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Our Industry
The restaurant industry is divided into two segments: full service and limited service. Full service is comprised of the casual dining, mid-scale, and fine dining sub-segments. Limited service is comprised of the QSR and fast casual sub-segments. QSRs are traditional fast food restaurants with average check sizes of $3.00 to $8.00. Fast casual is a limited or self-service format with average check sizes of $8.00 to $12.00 that offers food prepared to order within a generally more upscale establishment.
We operate within the broader LSR segment, and we strive to offer the food and dining experience of a fast casual restaurant and the speed, value, and convenience of a QSR. We strive to offer menu options that are made with fresh ingredients and provide a healthier alternative to typical fast food, which are also inspired by the culinary and cultural traditions of Mexico and our hometown of Los Angeles.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our continued growth:
Differentiated Restaurant Concept with Broad Appeal. We believe that our food, served in contemporary restaurant environments at reasonable prices, positions us well to satisfy the needs of our core Hispanic family market and appeal to the broader general market who seek convenient and high-quality meals at reasonable prices. We provide our customers with the opportunity to enjoy citrus-marinated, fire-grilled chicken and Mexican-inspired entrees containing distinctive ingredients such 
3

as avocados, mangos, and serrano peppers at price points that appeal to a broad consumer base. We believe that our entree prices are typically lower than the fast casual segment, and a slight premium to the QSR segment. We prepare our entrees to order in approximately four minutes and allow our customers the option to create their favorite flavor profiles using our freshly-prepared salsas before they enjoy their meals in our dining rooms or take their meals to go from the counter or the drive-thru. We also believe that our concept, which integrates the complexity of creating real food in real kitchens with the speed of our service model and the skill of our trained Grill Masters, provides a layer of competitive insulation around our restaurant model. We believe that our positioning appeals to a broad customer base, and that our brand crosses over traditional age, ethnic, and income demographics, giving consumers the best of both the fast casual and QSR segments. We seek to position ourselves as a differentiated restaurant concept, which we believe sources traffic from both dining segments and, as a result, we expect it to drive transaction growth in the future.
Mexican-Inspired, Fresh-Made Fire-Grilled Chicken and Entrees. Our signature product is our chicken, marinated with a proprietary recipe of citrus juice, garlic, and spices, which serves as the foundation of our distinctive menu of flavorful bone-in chicken meals and Mexican-inspired entrees. With menu items such as our signature individual chicken meals, family dinners, Chicken Tostada Salad, Pollo Bowl®, Chicken Avocado Burrito, and Double Chicken Avocado Salad, we believe that we offer our customers a healthier alternative to traditional food on-the-go. Our entrees are prepared using fresh ingredients with recipes inspired by Mexican cuisine. The majority of our menu items are prepared in-restaurant using fresh ingredients, including our bone-in chicken and chicken breast filets, rice, salsas, and cilantro dressing. These items start with our chicken, which is marinated in our restaurants daily. From there, our Grill Masters fire-grill and hand-chop our chicken to order. Our team members create our salsas, and cilantro dressings with fresh tomatoes, avocados, serrano peppers, and cilantro. In addition, our rice is seasoned, and simmered in our restaurants throughout each day.
Our bone-in chicken meals and Mexican-inspired entrees accounted for 46% and 54% of our company-operated restaurant sales, respectively, in 2018. Our individual and family-sized chicken meals appeal to customers looking to dine at the restaurant or take out during dinnertime, while our more-portable Mexican-inspired entrees draw traffic from customers at lunchtime or for an afternoon snack, enabling us to generate sales almost equally between lunch and dinner. We believe that our family-sized chicken meals provide a healthier and convenient alternative for mothers and families looking to solve the “dinnertime dilemma” of providing their families with high-quality meals without investing significant time or money. In 2018, approximately 28% of our company-operated sales were generated from family-sized meals.
Inviting Experience that Welcomes Our Customers. We believe that our restaurant design creates an inviting restaurant environment. The interiors of our restaurants feature large, open kitchens that allow customers to watch our Grill Masters prepare our fire-grilled chicken. Our restaurants also feature complimentary self-serve salsa bars showcasing our variety of fresh salsas. The salsa bars invite customers to customize their meals with several salsas prepared in our kitchens every day. Our dining rooms include comfortable booths and chairs, while large windows and soft lighting fill our restaurants with light and warmth.
Operations Infrastructure that Allows for Real-Time Control, Fast Feedback, and Innovation. We believe that satisfying our customers’ dining needs is the foundation for our business, and we have an operations platform that allows us to measure our performance in meeting and exceeding those needs. We utilize an operations dashboard that aggregates real-time, restaurant-level information for many aspects of our business. The dashboard provides corporate and field management, as well as restaurant-level operators, with insight into how we are performing both from the customer’s perspective and also through the eyes of experienced third-party auditors.
Developing High Average Unit Volumes (“AUVs”) and Strong Unit Economics One Chicken at a Time. We seek to position ourselves as a differentiated QSR+ business, which we believe drives restaurant operating results that are competitive with other leading restaurant concepts in both the fast casual and QSR industry segments. We believe that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, consistent restaurant-level financial results, and high returns on invested capital. In 2018, our company-operated restaurants generated average annual sales per restaurant of approximately $1.8 million and restaurant-level contribution margins of 19.0%.
Experienced Leadership. Most of our senior management team has extensive operating experience in the restaurant industry. Effective March 12, 2018, Bernard Acoca commenced as our new President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). Stephen J. Sather, our CEO since 2010 retired effective March 12, 2018.
Other members of the senior leadership team include Larry Roberts as our Chief Financial Officer, Hector Munoz as our Chief Marketing Officer and Jennifer Jaffe as our Chief People Officer.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that we are well-positioned for sales growth because of our strong appeal to our core Hispanic family market, appeal to the broader general market, signature fire-grilled chicken, disciplined business model, and strong unit economics. We 
4

plan to continue to expand our business, drive restaurant sales growth, maintain strong margins, and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies:
Expand Our Restaurant Base. As discussed below under “Site Selection and Expansion—Restaurant Development,” we plan to continue to expand our restaurant base.
We believe that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results and high returns on invested capital. Our investment model targets an average new unit cash investment of approximately $0.8 to $1.7 million, net of tenant allowances, and in a restaurant's third full year of operations, an AUV of approximately $1.8 million and a cash on cash return in excess of 20%, although there is no guarantee these targets will be met. New restaurant performance in outer markets, which include San Francisco/San Jose, Sacramento, Phoenix, Houston and Dallas are currently below these targets.
Increase Our Comparable Restaurant Sales. Our system has experienced annual comparable restaurant sales growth for eight consecutive years through our fiscal year ended December 26, 2018. We aim to build on this momentum by increasing customer frequency, attracting new customers, and improving per-person spend. Furthermore, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from shifting culinary and demographic trends in the United States.
Menu Strategy and Evolution. We will continue to adapt our menu to create family-sized dinner options and lunch entrees that complement our signature fire-grilled chicken, and are inspired by the culinary and cultural traditions of Mexico and our hometown of Los Angeles. We believe that we have opportunities for menu innovation as we look to increase customer frequency and target the dinner segment. In addition, we will continue to tap into the need for healthier offerings by building on the success of our fire-grilled chicken and “better for you” products. Our marketing and operations teams collaborate to ensure that the items developed in our test kitchen can be executed to our high standards in our restaurants with the convenience and value that our customers have come to expect.
Increase Brand Awareness and Consumer Engagement. We engage customers through our seasonal product calendar, which features new variations of menu items like our Chicken Tostada Salads and Stuffed Quesadillas. Our key points of differentiation are communicated through our advertising campaign, which highlights the brand's authenticity and our Grill Masters' expertise and dedication to high-quality grilled chicken. We tailor our message from television and direct mail, which garners broad exposure, to our Loco Rewards loyalty program and social media platform where we engage in more personalized marketing. 
The Loco Rewards loyalty program was launched on June 13, 2017. As of December 26, 2018, there were 1,164,217 members in the Loco Rewards loyalty program. The program offers one point for every dollar customers spend and a $10 reward when they achieve 100 points. Customers earn points primarily by scanning the El Pollo Loco app on Apple iOS or Android at the point of purchase, or by using the app to scan the barcode on their paper receipt anytime within 24 hours of their purchase. We build segmented dynamic campaigns with special offers tailored to each customer segment with the goals of increasing visit frequency and growing overall spend.
Within our restaurants we continue to engage our customers with point-of-purchase marketing material at various points along their path to purchase to further drive our differentiation.
Restaurant Design. In 2016 we launched our newest restaurant design called Vision. The Vision design elevates the brand image with exterior and interior features that embrace the brand’s authentic roots with warm textures, rustic elements and a focus on the signature open kitchen layout established in previous designs. As of December 26, 2018, including new builds and remodels, we had 99 restaurants open with the Vision design in our system.
Maintain Strong Margins. Since 2011, our restaurant contribution margin has ranged from 18.7% in 2011 to a high of 21.9% in 2014. Restaurant contribution margin was 19.0% in fiscal 2018. While rising labor costs as a result of tighter labor markets and rising minimum wages, along with moderate commodity inflation, continue to challenge unit profitability, we believe we can maintain strong margins through a combination of growing sales, price increases, labor efficiencies and other cost savings. 
Site Selection and Expansion 
Restaurant Development
We believe that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results, and high returns on invested capital, which we believe provide us with a strong foundation for unit growth over the long-term. In 2018, we opened eight new company-operated restaurants and nine new franchised restaurants. 
Sales and profit performance in our outer markets are below our expectations. While we continue to execute operations and marketing initiatives to improve the sales and profit performance in these markets, we are slowing our overall unit growth. As a result, we expect that overall unit development in 2019 will be lower than 2018. During 2018, we closed seven company-
5

operated restaurants in Texas, California and Arizona. For a discussion of the impairment of these restaurants, see below in "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant impairment of certain of our assets, in particular in our new markets."
In fiscal 2019, we intend to open three to four new company-operated and three to five new franchised restaurants. There is no guarantee that we will be able to open new company-operated or franchised restaurants, or to increase the overall number of our restaurants. We may be unsuccessful in expanding within existing or into new markets for a variety of reasons as described below in "Item 1A. Risk Factors," including competition for customers, sites, franchisees, employees, licenses, and financing.
Site Selection Process
We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in its long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential restaurant locations. Our in-house development team has extensive experience building such brands as Taco Bell, The Habit, Carl's Jr., Baskin Robbins, Wendy’s, Denny's, Johnny Rockets and Dunkin’ Brands. We use a combination of our in-house development team and outside real estate consultants to locate, evaluate, and negotiate new sites using various criteria, including demographic characteristics, daytime population thresholds, and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. The process for selecting locations incorporates management’s experience and expertise and includes extensive data collection and analysis. Additionally, we use information and intelligence gathered from managers and other restaurant personnel that live in or near the neighborhoods that we are considering.
Based on our experience and results, we are currently focused on developing freestanding sites with drive-thrus along with select in-line locations. Our restaurants perform well in a variety of neighborhoods, which gives us greater flexibility and lowers operating risk when selecting new restaurant locations.
We approve new restaurants only after formal review by our real estate site approval committee, which includes most of our senior management, and we monitor restaurants’ on-going performances to inform future site selection decisions.
Restaurant Construction
After identifying a lease site, we commence our restaurant build-out. Our new restaurants are either ground-up prototypes or retail space conversions. On average, it takes approximately 12 to 18 months from specific site identification to restaurant opening. Our restaurants are constructed in approximately 10 to 15 weeks. In order to maintain consistency of food and customer service, as well as our colorful, bright, and contemporary restaurant environment, we have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings.
Restaurant Management and Operations
Service
We are extremely focused on customer service. We aim to provide fast, friendly service on a solid foundation of dedicated, driven team members and managers. Our cashiers are trained on the menu items that we offer and offer customers thoughtful suggestions to enhance the ordering process. Our team members and managers are responsible for our service and dining room environment with a focus on hospitality, team members seek to engage in conversation with our customers to ensure satisfaction.  In addition, constant monitoring of the dining room occurs to ensure the fresh salsa bar and beverage station are clean and supplied with products.
Operations
We utilize systems that are aimed at measuring our ability to deliver a “best in class” experience for our customers. These systems include customer surveys, mystery shopper scores, and speed-of-service performance trends. The operational results from all of these sources are then presented on an operations dashboard that displays the measures in an easy-to-read online format that corporate and restaurant-level management and franchisees can utilize in order to identify strengths and opportunities and to develop specific plans for continuous performance improvement.
We have food safety and quality assurance programs designed to maintain the highest standards for the food and the food preparation procedures that are used by both company-operated and franchised restaurants. We have a quality assurance team and employ third-party auditors that perform our work place and food safety restaurant audits.
Managers and Team Members
Each of our restaurants typically has a general manager, an assistant manager and two to three shift leaders. There are between 20 and 35 team members per restaurant, who prepare our food fresh daily and provide customer service. To lead our restaurant management teams, we have area leaders, each of whom is responsible for 8 to 12 restaurants. Overseeing the area leaders are 
6

three directors of operations who report to a senior director of operations. An additional senior director of operations oversees our area leaders and franchisees in Texas. Franchise operations are supported by three directors of franchise and the restaurant development team is supported by four directors who all currently report to the Vice President, Development and Franchise. 
Training
Our people are the center of the El Pollo Loco customer experience. Creating a culture of constant learning has been essential in equipping our people with the skills to deliver our high standards and commitments to our guests and employees. We strive to find ways to simplify our methodology and invest in elevating our people.  In a rapidly evolving landscape, effective training is not only dependent on quality of content, but also on method of delivery. To engage our growing base of millennial employees, we employ a Learning Management System called Pollo Zone, our tablet-based learning tool. This platform is a central hub for all training efforts and features individual learner profiles to support engagement and accountability on our path toward investing in our people and their growth.  
Franchise Program 
We use a franchising strategy to increase new restaurant growth in certain markets, leveraging the ownership of entrepreneurs with specific local market expertise and requiring a relatively minimal capital commitment by us. As of December 26, 2018, there were a total of 271 franchised restaurants. Franchisees range in size from single-restaurant operators to the largest franchisee, which owned 60 restaurants as of December 26, 2018. Our existing franchise base consists of many successful, longstanding, multi-unit restaurant operators. As of December 26, 2018, approximately 75% of franchised restaurants were owned and operated by franchisees that had been with us for over 20 years.
We believe that the franchise revenue generated from our franchise base has historically served as an important source of stable and recurring cash flows to us, and we accordingly plan to expand our base of franchised restaurants. In existing markets, we encourage growth from current franchisees. In our expansion markets, we seek highly-qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities.
We believe that creating a foundation of initial and on-going support is important for future success, both for our franchisees and for our brand. Therefore, we have structured our corporate staff, programs, and communication systems to ensure that we are delivering high-quality support to our franchisees.
Our franchise training program is a key element in ensuring our franchise owners and their managers are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary for success. The program introduces new franchise members to El Pollo Loco with hands-on training in the operation and management of our restaurants. This foundational training is conducted by a general training manager who has been certified by our operations group. Training must be successfully completed before a trainee can be assigned to a restaurant as a manager.
Once introductory training has been completed, we offer a path toward constant learning for all crew members by providing instructional materials that span management training, operations, new product introductions, food safety and a number of other essential restaurant functions. Many of these programs are distributed through Pollo Zone, as a central hub for all training efforts and features individual learner profiles that will provide our franchise owners with real-time access to the progress of learning in their restaurants.
Marketing and Advertising
We strive to distinguish the El Pollo Loco brand by building a brand equity that we believe not only accentuates our strengths but also deepens the strong emotional connections we have with our customers. In October 2018, we completed codifying our brand architecture in a comprehensive brand book, which will shape our strategic brand decisions and influence how we communicate the El Pollo Loco brand to consumers. We promote our restaurants and products by emphasizing our points of differentiation, from our fresh ingredients and made-from-scratch preparation, to the cooking of our citrus-marinated chicken on open fire grills in our kitchens, as well as the convenience and quality we offer for families.
We use multiple marketing channels, including television, digital, and print, to broadly drive brand awareness and purchases of our featured products. We advertise on local broadcast and cable television.
Through our public relations efforts, we engage notable food editors and bloggers on a range of topics to help promote our products. In addition, we engage in one-on-one conversations using a portfolio of social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We also use social media as a research and customer service tool, and apply insights gained to future marketing efforts.

Our Loco Rewards loyalty program uses points, rewards, and offers to build engagement with our customers. Customers access the program on elpolloloco.com and the El Pollo Loco iOS Apple and Android app. We build segmented dynamic campaigns with special offers tailored to each customer segment with the goals of increasing visit frequency and growing overall spend. To keep customers engaged with the program, unannounced offers, called "Surprise and Delights" are awarded based on that customer’s transaction history. We communicate offers, loyalty updates and other Loco Rewards campaigns to customers via in-app messaging, mobile phone push notifications and email.
Our online ordering program makes it easy for customers to skip the line and order ahead. Available for every location and accessible from elpolloloco.com or the El Pollo Loco mobile app, any order can be placed and paid for before arriving at the restaurant. During the third quarter of 2018, we added the ability for customers to pay for online orders with their mobile phones using a stored value component built into our app, as well as the capability to e-gift El Pollo Loco to a friend or a family member. For additional convenience, as of December 26, 2018, 200 company and 176 franchise locations offered integrated delivery through a third party service. 
In 2004 we created El Pollo Loco Charities, a non-profit charity, to support the communities surrounding our restaurants. El Pollo Loco Charities has provided over 15,000 meals per year to underprivileged families, through organizations like Food on Foot, Habitat for Humanity, Children’s Institute, and Court Appointed Special Advocates. 
Purchasing and Distribution 
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients, and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications, from reliable suppliers. We regularly inspect our vendors to ensure that products purchased conform to our standards and that prices offered are competitive. We have a quality assurance team and third party accredited auditors that perform comprehensive supplier audits on a frequency schedule based on the potential food safety risk for each product. We contract with McLane Company (our “primary distributor”), a major foodservice distributor, for substantially all of our food and supplies, including the poultry that our restaurants receive from suppliers. Our primary distributor delivers supplies to most of our restaurants three times per week. Our restaurants in Texas utilize regional distributors for produce. Our franchisees are required to use our primary distributor or an approved regional distributor, and franchisees must purchase food and supplies from approved suppliers. Poultry is our largest product cost item and represented approximately 40% of our total food and paper costs for 2018. Fluctuations in supply and in price can significantly impact our restaurant service and profit performance. We actively manage cost volatility for poultry by negotiating with multiple suppliers and entering into what we believe are the most favorable contract terms given existing market conditions. In the past, we have entered into contracts ranging from one to two years depending on current and expected market conditions. We currently source poultry from six suppliers, with two accounting for approximately 67% of our planned purchases for fiscal 2019. We have fixed prices for 100% of our poultry supply through the end of 2019.
Intellectual Property 
We have registered El Pollo Loco ® , Pollo Bowl ® , The Crazy Chicken ® , and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and El Pollo Loco ® in approximately 42 foreign countries. In addition, the El Pollo Loco logo, website name and address, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube accounts are our intellectual property. Our policy is to pursue and maintain registration of service marks and trademarks in those countries where business strategy requires us to do so, and to oppose vigorously any infringement or dilution of the service marks or trademarks in those countries. We maintain the recipe for our chicken marinade, as well as certain proprietary standards, specifications, and operating procedures, as trade secrets or as confidential proprietary information.
Competition
We operate in the restaurant industry, which is highly competitive and fragmented. The number, size, and strength of competitors varies by region. Our competition includes a variety of locally-owned restaurants and national and regional chains that offer dine-in, carry-out, and delivery services. Our competition from the broadest perspective includes restaurants, pizza parlors, convenience food stores, delicatessens, supermarkets, and club stores. There are no significant direct competitors with respect to menus that feature marinated, fire-grilled chicken. However, we indirectly compete with fast casual restaurants, including Chipotle, Panera, Qdoba, and Rubio’s, among others, and with chicken-specialty QSRs and Mexican QSRs, such as Chick-fil-A, Church’s Chicken, KFC, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Del Taco and Taco Bell, among others.
We believe that competition within the fast casual restaurant segment is based primarily on ambience, price, taste, quality, and freshness of menu items, as well as on the convenience of drive-thru service. We also believe that QSR competition is based 
8

primarily on quality, taste, speed of service, value, brand recognition, restaurant location, and customer service. In addition, we compete with franchisors of other restaurant concepts for prospective franchisees.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are also subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including regulation of discharges into the air and water, storage and disposal of waste, and clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater. Under various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, in, or emanating from that property. Such liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
Certain of our properties may be located on sites that we know or suspect have been used by prior owners or operators as retail gas stations. Such properties previously contained underground storage tanks (“USTs”), and while we are not aware of any sites with USTs remaining, it is possible that some of these properties may currently contain abandoned USTs. We are aware of contamination from a release of hazardous materials by a previous owner at two of our owned properties and one of our leased properties. We do not believe that we have contributed to the contamination at any of these properties. The appropriate state agencies have been notified, and these issues are being handled without disruption to our business. It is possible that petroleum products and other contaminants may have been released at other properties into the soil or groundwater. Under applicable federal and state environmental laws, we, as the current owner or operator of these sites, may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation for any contamination. Although we lease most of our properties, and, when we own, we obtain certain assurances from the prior owner or often obtain indemnity agreements from third parties, we cannot assure you that we will not be liable for environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future restaurants or restaurant sites. If we were found liable for the cost of remediation of contamination at, or emanating from, any of our properties, our operating expenses would likely increase and our operating results would likely be materially and adversely affected.
Since 2000, we have obtained “Phase One” environmental reports for new restaurants. Where warranted, we obtain updated reports, and, if necessary, in rare cases, we obtain “Phase Two” reports. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties or operations. No assurance can be given that we have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties or that such liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Regulation and Compliance
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local government regulations, including those relating to, among other things, public health and safety, zoning and fire codes, and franchising. Failures to obtain or retain food or other licenses and registrations, or exemptions thereto, would adversely affect the operations of restaurants. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant problems in obtaining required licenses, permits, or approvals, any difficulties, delays, or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a restaurant in a particular area.
The development and construction of additional restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We believe that federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use, and environmental factors could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants.
We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and various federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and other working requirements and conditions. A significant portion of our hourly staff is paid at rates consistent with the applicable federal, state, or local minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the applicable minimum wage will increase our labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, and which may require us to design or modify our restaurants to make reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals.
For a discussion of the various regulatory and compliance risks that we face, see below under "Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Management Information Systems
All of our company-operated and franchised restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems, which we believe can scale to support our long-term growth plans. Our point-of-sale system provides a touch-screen interface and is integrated with segmented Europay, Mastercard and Visa tokenized high speed credit and gift card processing hardware. Our 
9

point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which provides daily sales and product mix information that we actively analyze.
Our in-restaurant back-office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and to provide labor and food cost management tools. The system also provides corporate headquarters and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data, and reduces the time spent by restaurant managers on administrative needs. The system further provides sales, bank deposit, and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. For company-operated restaurants, we use this data to generate weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly profit and loss statements for each location, with final reports following the end of each period.
Employees 
As of December 26, 2018, we had approximately 5,573 employees, of whom approximately 5,410 were hourly restaurant employees comprised of 4,522 crewmembers, 198 general managers, 202 assistant managers, 438 shift leaders, and 50 employees in limited-time roles as acting managers or as managers in training. The remaining 163 employees were corporate and office personnel. None of our employees are part of a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory.
Seasonality
Seasonal factors, including weather and the timing of holidays, cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced January and December transactions and higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of seasonality, our quarterly and annual results of operations and key performance indicators such as company restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate.
Recent Developments
On October 29, 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with Hector Munoz which sets forth the terms and conditions under which he will serve as the Company’s Chief Marketing Officer.
