ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Nearly 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, and over 40% of the world’s population lives within approximately 150 miles of a coast. Thousands of information gathering and/or power systems are deployed in the oceans today to increase our understanding of weather, climate change, biological processes, and marine mammal patterns as well as supporting exploration and operations for industries such as oil and gas. Most of these systems are powered by battery, solar, wind, fuel cell, or fossil fuel generators that may be unreliable and expensive to operate while they also may be limited in their ability to deliver ample electric power. These current systems often necessitate significant tradeoffs in sensor accuracy, data processing and communications bandwidth and frequency in order to operate given limited available power. More persistent power systems requiring less maintenance, such as our products, may have the ability to save costs over these current systems. Equally important are increases in available power may allow for better sensors, faster data sampling and higher frequency communication intervals up to real-time which could improve scientific and economic returns.
 
Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Monroe Township, New Jersey, we believe we are the leader in ocean wave power conversion technology. Our PB3 PowerBuoy® is our first fully commercial product which generates electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves. In addition to our PB3 PowerBuoy®, we continue to develop our PowerBuoy® product line based on modular, ocean-going buoys, which we have been periodically ocean testing since 1997. In November 2018 the Company announced additional complementary products, the hybrid PowerBuoy® and subsea battery solutions which leverage our existing expertise in offshore power systems while expanding our product line beyond our flagship PB3 PowerBuoy® offering.
 
The PB3 PowerBuoy® generates power for use in remote offshore locations, independent of a conventional power grid. It features a unique onboard power take-off (“PTO”) system, which incorporates both energy storage and energy management and control systems. The PB3 generates a nominal name-plated capacity rating of up to 3 kilowatts (“kW”) of peak power during recharging of the onboard batteries. Power generation is deployment-site dependent whereby average power generated can increase substantially at very active sites. Our standard energy storage system (“ESS”) has an energy capacity of up to a nominal 150 kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) to meet specific application requirements. We believe there is a substantial addressable market for the current capabilities of our PB3, which we believe could be utilized in a variety of applications.
 
In addition to leveraging earlier design aspects of our autonomous PowerBuoy®, the PB3 has undergone extensive factory and in-ocean design validation testing. Currently, our engineering efforts are continuing to expand the PowerBuoy® capability with simplified deployment and mooring options and working together with our customer base to ensure flexible systems integration and to optimize energy output. Our marketing efforts are focused on applications in remote offshore locations that require reliable and persistent power and communications, either by supplying electric power to payloads that are integrated directly in or on our PowerBuoy® or located in its vicinity, such as on the seabed and in the water column.
 
Based on our market research and publicly available data, we believe that numerous markets have a direct need for our PowerBuoy® including oil and gas, defense and security, science and research, and communications. Depending on payload power requirements, sensor types and other considerations, we have found that our PowerBuoy® could satisfy several application requirements within these markets. We believe that the PB3 consistently generates sufficient power to meet the requirements of many potential customer applications within our target markets.
 
Since fiscal 2002, government agencies have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. These revenues were largely for the support of our development efforts relating to our technology. Today our goal is to generate the majority of our revenue from the sale or lease of our products, and sales of services to support our business operations. As we continue to develop and commercialize our products, we expect to have a net loss of cash from operating activities unless and until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services. During fiscal 2018 we continued work on projects with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (“MES”), and commenced work with Premier Oil (“PMO”) and Eni S.p.A. (“Eni”). During fiscal 2019 we continued work with PMO and Eni and commenced work with Enel Green Power (“EGP”), the U.S. Navy Small Business Innovation Research (“U.S. SBIR”) program, and a leading oil & gas operator.

Competitive Advantages
 
We are commercializing our PB3 PowerBuoy® by targeting customers principally in four markets that require reliable and persistent power sources in remote offshore locations (as discussed in further detail below). We believe that our wave energy products and services, and our existing commercial relationships provide the following competitive advantages in our target markets.

● | Numerous applications within multiple, major market segments. We have designed our PB3 PowerBuoy® to address multiple offshore applications around the world. In particular, we are targeting customers with multiple applications within the oil and gas, defense and security, science and research, and communications markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Considerable life-cycle cost savings over current solutions for many applications. Our PB3 PowerBuoy® is designed to operate over extended intervals between required servicing, compared to several current solutions which we found to require more servicing using offshore vessels. We believe that our PB3 PowerBuoy® reduces costs over multi-year operations compared with current solutions. These cost reductions are mostly due to reduced vessel and personnel servicing activities. 
● | Real-time data communications. Some current solutions with less available power than our PowerBuoy® may have limited communication capabilities or may be able to communicate data only over shorter periods due to power limitations. Some current solutions may only make data accessible upon physical retrieval of the sensor. Our PowerBuoy® can be equipped with a variety of communications equipment, such as 4G LTE, satellite (VSAT) and Wi-Fi, which enables the transmission of data on a more frequent basis. We believe that more frequent data communication could enable an end-user to more quickly and proactively make data-driven decisions which could result in economic advantages. 
● | Increased power and persistence compared to certain current solutions. We have found that our PowerBuoy® may provide substantially increased power and persistence than certain existing battery and solar powered systems. We believe that this may allow additional sensors to be employed at the same site, a higher sensor data transmission rate to be achieved, extended operation and reduced downtime, and improved operational costs for the customer. Enabling these new capabilities may contribute to enhanced operations through real-time decision making and increased life-cycle cost savings. 
● | Standard transportation and deployment. Our PB3 PowerBuoy® does not require special handling or transportation, and instead uses conventional transportation and handling methods that are economical and readily available in standard marine operations. This may result in lower global transportation and deployment costs than current solutions. Our PB3 PowerBuoy® can be deployed using conventional vessels and conventional marine cranes and lifts. 
● | Modular and scalable designs. Our PB3 PowerBuoy® is designed with a modular ESS which allows us to tailor its configuration to specific application requirements, including expansion of energy storage capacity, potentially allowing for a more customized solution and potential cost savings for our customers. We believe that our PowerBuoy® is scalable to higher power levels, and multiple PowerBuoys® may also be installed in an array in order to achieve higher levels of aggregate power, although we have not yet demonstrated a PowerBuoy® array.

● | Flexible electrical, mechanical and communication interfaces for sensors. The PB3 PowerBuoy® can be equipped with payloads, either mounted on or within the PowerBuoy®, or tethered to the PowerBuoy®. The PB3 PowerBuoy® has mechanical and electrical interfaces which allow for simplified integration of payloads, creating flexibility for the end-user. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Environmentally benign and aesthetically non-intrusive system design. We believe that our PB3 PowerBuoy® does not present significant risks to marine life, or emit significant levels of pollutants, and therefore has minimal environmental impact as compared to some other current solutions. We believe there is no significant audible impact and our system does not have a negative effect on marine life, as validated by the U.S. Navy and Department of Energy (“DOE”). 
● | Ocean and factory-tested technology. Our PB3 PowerBuoy® is designed to be durable, with a three-year interval between required maintenance activities. The PB3 has survived hurricanes and tropical storms during harsh sea conditions. Since 1997 we have conducted ocean tests to demonstrate the viability of our technology. In 2011, we conducted multiple ocean tests of the predecessor PB3 PowerBuoy® under a contract with the U.S. Navy. More recently, we conducted multiple ocean tests of our current generation PB3 PowerBuoy®. Commercial versions of the PB3 have been successfully deployed for MES and Eni. The MES PB3 PowerBuoy® performed well in a challenging shallow-water, high-current environment, and achieved its performance and duration objectives. The Eni PB3 PowerBuoy® deployed in the Adriatic Sea has been in the water for over seven months (as of June 2019) and has generated over one megawatt-hour of energy. In 2015, we instituted factory-based PTO-accelerated life testing which simulates continuous operations under extremely harsh conditions. During the 2018 fiscal year, we also implemented additional features to the PB3 PowerBuoy® design to accommodate heavy top-side payloads and seafloor-based payloads. Further, we continue to focus on standardizing manufacturing and production testing procedures and to work closely with our supply base to ensure production repeatability. 
● | Efficient design in harnessing wave energy. We have designed and validated our PB3 PowerBuoy® for maximized power generation in average ocean wave conditions through optimized mechanical to electrical wave energy conversion. We have designed the onboard ESS to provide several days of continuous rated power during periods of low or no wave activity, depending on payload power consumption. The PB3 PowerBuoy® is equipped with a variety of communication capabilities including satellite, cellular, and Wi-Fi that are capable of transmitting payload data in real time (e.g., sensors or equipment that require power and communications capabilities), subject to the limits of the service provider. 
● | Prior commercial relationships enabled the development of our technology. Our prior and existing relationships with the U.S. Navy, DOE, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, MES, Eni and PMO have allowed us to develop our PB3 PowerBuoy® for a variety of needs in various industries. We believe these relationships have helped position us within the private sector in support of commercialization, which we believe enhances our market visibility and attractiveness to our prospective customers. For example, in 2011 our PowerBuoy® provided persistent power to an integrated radar and sonar system, significantly extending the U.S. Navy’s surveillance range. We have also demonstrated persistent maritime vessel detection with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by integrating a hydrophone onto our PowerBuoy® and demonstrating enhanced maritime traffic detection. In each instance, the resulting data have informed our next round of design iterations to improve critical operations and reliability.

Business Strategy
 
We continue to commercialize our PB3 PowerBuoy® for use in remote offshore power and real-time data communications applications. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business objectives:

● | Sell and/or lease the PB3 PowerBuoy®. We believe our PB3 PowerBuoy® is well-suited for many remote offshore applications. We have investigated potential market demand for both PowerBuoy® sales and leases within our selected markets, and we intend to sell and lease the PB3 PowerBuoy® to these markets. Additionally, we intend to provide services associated with product sales and leases such as maintenance, remote monitoring and diagnostic, application engineering, planning, training, and logistics support required for the PB3 PowerBuoy® life-cycle. We continue to increase our commercial capabilities through new hires in marketing, sales, and application support, and through engagement of expert market consultants in various geographies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand product offerings by adding new complimentary products that are cost efficient and designed for shorter and faster deployments, which will create a system solutions approach for our customers. We are currently developing two new complementary products to our PB3 PowerBuoy®, the hybrid PowerBuoy® and subsea battery solutions. These products build on our existing expertise in offshore power systems and are targeted for a near term deployment. The hybrid PowerBuoy® is to be highly complementary to the PB3 PowerBuoy® by providing the Company the opportunity to address a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, including low-wave environments, with the potential for greater Company integration within each customer project. The hybrid PowerBuoy® is primarily intended for shorter term deployment applications such as eROV and AUV inspections and short-term maintenance, topside surveillance and communications, and subsea equipment and controls. The subsea battery solutions are expected to offer the possibility of creating a sea floor energy storage solution for remote offshore operations. These subsea battery systems will contain lithium ion batteries, which provide high power density to supply power that can enable subsea equipment, sensors, communications, AUVs and electric remotely operated vehicles (eROV) recharge. Ideal for many remote offshore customer applications, these subsea battery systems are anticipated to be high performance, cost-efficient, and quickly deployable.
● | Concentrate sales and marketing efforts in specific geographic markets. We are currently focusing our marketing efforts on parts of North America, Europe, South America and Asia. We believe that each of these areas has sizable end market opportunities, political and economic stability, and high levels of industrialization and economic development. 
● | Expand our relationships in key market areas through strategic partnerships and collaborations. We believe that strategic partners are an important part of commercializing a new product. Partnerships and collaborations can be used to improve the development of overall integrated solutions, create new market channels, expand commercial know-how and geographic footprint, and bolster our product delivery capabilities. We believe that offering a turn-key solution, and not just power, is key to securing long term success. 
● | Commercial collaborations. We believe that an important element of our business strategy is to collaborate with other organizations to leverage our combined expertise, market presence and access, and core competences across key markets. We have formed such a relationship with several well-known groups, including Modus Seabed Intervention Ltd. (“Modus”), Saab Seaeye Ltd. (“Saab”), NEC Energy Solutions (“NEC”), Acteon Field Life Service Ltd. (“Acteon”), MES, PMO and Eni. We continue to seek other opportunities to collaborate with application experts from within our selected markets. 
● | Outsourcing of fabrication, deployment and service support. We outsource all fabrication, anchoring, mooring, cabling supply, and in most cases deployment of our PowerBuoy® to minimize our capital requirements as we scale our business. Our PTO is a proprietary subsystem and is assembled and tested at our facility. We believe this distributed manufacturing and assembly approach enables us to focus on our core competencies and ensure a cost-effective product by leveraging a larger more established supply base. We also continue to seek strategic partnerships with regard to servicing of our PB3 PowerBuoy®. 
● | PB3 cost reduction and PowerBuoy® product development. Our engineering efforts are focused on customer application development for PB3 sales, cost reduction of our PB3 PowerBuoy® and improving the energy output, reliability, maintenance interval and expected operating life of our PowerBuoy®. We continue to optimize manufacturability of our designs with a focus on cost competitiveness, and we believe we will be able to address new applications by developing new products that increase energy output. 

 
In addition, we are developing complementary products, the hybrid PowerBuoy® and subsea battery solutions which leverage our existing expertise in offshore power systems while expanding our product line beyond our flagship PB3 PowerBuoy® offering.
 
Market Opportunities
 
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) Ocean Enterprise Report for 2016 estimated that the annual market for what NOAA describes as the “Ocean Enterprise” is $8.5 billion. The report addressed for-profit and not-for-profit businesses that support ocean measurement, observation and forecasting. Among the market sectors included in the report are oil and gas, defense and security, and science and research. We believe that this report addresses only a segment of the potential market opportunities that we are targeting.

Oil and Gas
 
We believe the offshore oil and gas industry is undergoing a significant transformation as it continues to invest in new technologies that enable cost savings and the digitization of operations. The industry encompasses more than 10,000 offshore sites, including exploration, production, reservoir management, and sites pending decommissioning based on information from the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and industry organizations and publications. We believe that we have opportunities to implement one or more PB3 PowerBuoys® at a large number of these sites to provide power in applications that are not currently possible, or to displace current power solutions.
Defense and Security
 
We believe that our PB3 PowerBuoy® is uniquely positioned to be used to provide power and communications for multiple applications within the defense and security markets. The PB3’s ability to power multiple payloads may be an attractive feature for these markets, as their systems can be easily integrated into other PowerBuoy® applications allowing their operation to be concealed. An example application for domestic and international defense departments and defense contractors includes forward deployed energy and communications outposts (which is a current U.S. Department of Defense program), both above and below sea surface. Other example applications include early detection and warning systems, remote sensing stations, high frequency radar, sonar, electro-optical and infrared sensors for maritime security, network communications systems, and unmanned underwater vehicle docking stations. According to a 2014 Frost and Sullivan report, market expenditures for global security reached $29.0 billion in 2012 and are projected to reach $56.5 billion in 2022. Maritime security expenditures were approximately 45% of the global security market.
Science and Research
 
The science and research market provides environmental intelligence to the entire ocean enterprise, which supports ocean measurement, observation and forecasting, and is an important provider of information to maritime commerce and the entire “blue economy.” Maritime commerce and the scientific community depend on information in areas such as meteorology, climate change, ocean currents, and biological processes to inform operations and development. These groups often require a power and communications solution in remote offshore locations. According to NOAA’s 2016 Ocean Enterprise report, the total U.S. available ocean observing market from 2017 through 2021 for ocean-based systems infrastructure is projected to be $2.0 billion.
Communications
 
We believe that opportunities also exist in other markets such as communications. The addition of near shore and offshore cellular and Wi-Fi platforms with reliable and persistent power could open new market opportunities for telecommunications carriers by displacing a portion of the maritime satellite communications market, while potentially decreasing communications costs for the marine and offshore oil and gas industries. According to an industry research paper titled “Prospects for Maritime Satellite Communications” in 2015 the global maritime satellite communications market had already reached close to 338,000 terminals, with $1.7 billion in revenue at the satellite communications service provider level. The report also noted that the value of the maritime satellite communications market is expected to continue to grow over the next decade, with a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 5% in terminals and revenue, primarily due to the increasing need for maritime data communications.

Implementation Strategy
 
We have made significant progress in redesigning and validating our commercial-ready PB3 PowerBuoy® for use in remote offshore applications. Since 2015, we have brought the PB3 from initial concept to a full-scale design. We have performed multiple prototype iterations. During this time, we have conducted a number of in-ocean tests in combination with our facility-based accelerated life testing to validate our commercial-ready PB3 PowerBuoy® and to prepare for low rate initial production. In 2017, we relocated our corporate headquarters to Monroe Township, New Jersey. We believe that this new facility will allow us to expand our manufacturing capabilities and to move toward higher volume PowerBuoy® production. In fiscal 2019 we made progress in marketing our PB3 PowerBuoy®, as evidenced by the volume of proposals submitted to customers and requests for proposals from customers. In addition, during fiscal 2019 we introduced two new products, the hybrid PowerBuoy® and subsea battery solutions with prototypes set for release in Fall 2019. We have made substantial progress in transitioning from R&D to a commercialization focus with SELL, BUILD, SHIP as our motto and we intend to build on our success by implementing processes and solutions that cover the entire life cycle, from demand generation to closing the contract, and from channel strategies to customer care.
 
Since 2015, we have had initial introductions or meetings with nearly 200 companies and organizations within our target markets. A large proportion of these engagements (approximately 75%) were U.S.-based, while the remaining engagements occurred in Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia including Japan. One-third of all engagements have transitioned from initial introductions to advanced, confidential discussions around specific customer applications. Many of these discussions occur at the executive, decision-making level, as well as the implementation level.
 
As previously noted, several of these customer application discussions have resulted in requests for proposals. Many proposal requests are for projects where our PB3 PowerBuoy® is part of a larger solution demonstration, and typically include the potential lease or sale of one or more PB3 PowerBuoys®, as well as required services and maintenance support. Demonstration projects are a necessary step toward broad solution deployment and revenues associated with specific applications. A proposal phase typically lasts from three months to more than one year. During the demonstration project specification, negotiation and evaluation period, we are often subject to the prospective customer’s vendor qualification process, which entails substantial due diligence of our company and capabilities and may include negotiation of standard terms and conditions. Many proposals contain provisions which would mandate the sale or lease of the PB3 PowerBuoy® upon successful conclusion of the demonstration project.
 
We believe this is an accurate depiction of the overall sales cycle for new technology in each of our target markets, including the PB3 PowerBuoy®. However, cycle times for each step of the sales cycle will vary depending on several customer factors, including, but not limited to, technical evaluation, project priorities, the funding approval process, and alignment of new technology integration with the customer’s broader operational strategy. We believe that the resulting evidence of potential demand, vis-à-vis specific application proposal requests, are indicative of significant progress in our commercialization strategy. We believe that we have the potential for growth as a result of our positioning for higher volume production of our PB3 PowerBuoy® and the initial indications of demand for our PB3 PowerBuoy® in multiple customer applications.
 
Product and Technologies
 
The following is a summary of the development and history of our current PowerBuoy® product and our technologies.
 
Wave Energy
 
The energy contained in ocean waves is a form of renewable energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity. The interaction between the wind and the ocean surface causes energy to be transferred from the wind to the water. At first, small waves occur on the ocean surface. As this process continues, the waves become larger and the distance between the top of the waves becomes longer. Wave heights, and the amount of kinetic wave energy, depends on wind speed, wind duration and the distance covered. The vertical water motion caused by the passage of the waves moves the float component of our PowerBuoy®, creating mechanical energy which our proprietary technologies convert into usable electricity.
 
We believe that using wave energy for electricity generation has the following potential benefits, compared to existing incumbent solutions.
 

6
-


● | Scalability within a small site area. Due to the dense energy in ocean waves, we believe that multiple PowerBuoys® may be aggregated in an array that would occupy a reasonably small area to supply electricity to larger payloads. We believe the aggregation of a larger number of PowerBuoys® could offer end users a variety of advantages in availability, reliability and scalability. To date, we have not deployed an array of PowerBuoys® to test and validate our hypothesis, and we cannot assure that a PowerBuoy® array would generate the energy required to meet the needs of every prospective customer. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Predictability. The generation of power from wave energy can be forecasted several days in advance. Available wave energy can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy based on satellite images and meteorological data, even when the wave field is hundreds of miles away and days from reaching a PowerBuoy®. Therefore, we believe end-users relying on PowerBuoys® for power may be able to proactively plan their logistics, payload scheduling and other operational activities based on such data and proactively, although actual testing has not yet been conducted. 
● | Constant source of energy. The annual occurrence of waves at certain specific sites can be relatively constant and defined with relatively high accuracy. Based on our studies and analyses of various sites of interest, we believe that we will be able to deploy our PowerBuoys® in locations where the waves could produce usable electricity for the majority of the year. 

 
Methods for generating electricity from wave energy can be divided into two general categories: onshore systems and offshore systems. Our PowerBuoys® are the offshore type. Many offshore systems, including our PowerBuoy®, utilize a flotation device to harness wave energy. The heaving or pitching of the flotation device due to the force of the waves creates mechanical energy, which is converted into electricity by various technologies. Onshore and near shore systems are often located on a shore cliff or a breakwater, or a short distance at sea from the shore line, and typically must concentrate the wave energy before using it to drive an electrical generator. Although maintenance costs of onshore systems may be less than those associated with offshore systems, we believe there are a variety of disadvantages to the former. As waves approach the shore, their energy decreases, therefore, onshore and near shore wave power stations are not capable of exploiting the same amount of energy produced by waves in deeper water. In addition, suitable sites for onshore and near shore systems are limited and potential environmental and aesthetic issues may impede development of these systems due to wave power station size and proximity to communities.
 
Our principal product is our PB3 PowerBuoy®, which is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in remote offshore locations. It consists of a main hull structure loosely moored to the seabed and surrounded by a floating buoy-like device that can freely move up and down in response to the passage of the waves. The PTO device that includes an electrical generator, a power electronics system, our control system, and our ESS are sealed within the hull. As ocean waves pass the PowerBuoy®, the mechanical stroke action created by the rising and falling of the waves is converted into rotational mechanical energy by the PTO, which in turn, drives the electrical generator. The power electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is collected within an ESS. The operation of the PowerBuoy® is controlled by our customized, proprietary control system.
 
The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the PowerBuoy® subsystems as well as the characteristics of the waves which interact with the PowerBuoy®. The control system collects data from the sensors and the payloads and uses proprietary algorithms to electronically adjust the performance of the PowerBuoy®. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the PowerBuoy® is a significant advantage of our technology.
 
In the event of large storm waves, the control system automatically locks the PowerBuoy® and electricity generation is suspended. However, the load center (either the on-board payload or one in the vicinity of the PowerBuoy®) may continue to receive power from the on-board ESS. When wave heights return to normal operating conditions, the control system automatically unlocks the PowerBuoy® and electricity generation and ESS replenishment recommences. This safety feature helps to prevent the PowerBuoy® from being damaged by storms.

In March 2016, we announced a rebranding of our PowerBuoy® systems as part of our commercialization efforts and to closely align our PowerBuoy® products with the perceived best practices of analogous industries based on power generation and on-board energy storage capabilities. Under our new naming conventions, our current PowerBuoy® is referred to as the “PB3,” corresponding to “PowerBuoy® with a nominal name-plated capacity rating of three kilowatts.” References to the “APB350” on our website, and in our SEC filings including this Annual Report refers to earlier prototype PowerBuoys® containing earlier generation PTOs and other earlier technologies.
 
The PB3 has undergone design iterations focused on improving its reliability and survivability in the anticipated operating ocean environment and will continue to undergo further enhancements through customary product life cycle management. The PB3-A1 was an initial prototype that has now undergone in-ocean and accelerated life testing, and we believe that the PB3 achieved a maturity level for use by early adopters in fiscal 2017. We continue the process of commercialization of our product and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to do so. We believe that the PB3 will generate and store sufficient power to address some application requirements in our target markets. Our engineering efforts are focused, in part, on increasing the energy output and efficiency of our PowerBuoys® and, if we are able to do so, we believe the PowerBuoy® would then be useful for additional applications where cost savings and additional power are required by our potential customers. We continue to explore opportunities in these target markets, although we have not yet developed any integrated solutions and product offerings in these potential markets. We believe that by increasing the energy output of our PowerBuoys® we may be able to address larger segments of our target markets. By improving our design and manufacturing, we also seek to reduce the cost of our PowerBuoys® through further design iterations and manufacturing ramp-up. In so doing, we seek to improve customer value, displace more incumbent solutions, and become a viable power source for additional applications in our target market segments.

Deployments
 
We continue to receive important feedback from in-ocean trial deployments of our PowerBuoys®, as is customary in the marine industry for new vessels and products prior to final acceptance by their customers. If we are able to increase PowerBuoy® production, we anticipate that the need for in-ocean trials of our mature products will diminish. Deployment sites are selected based on minimum ocean depth, appropriate wave activity for power generation requirements of associated deployment payloads, and proximity to end-user operations. The PB3 can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods. Once at port, the PB3 can be lifted into the water or onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity. The PB3 may then be towed to site using a standard vessel (if the location is within an appropriate distance from the port), or the PB3 may be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site. The PB3 is then attached to the mooring system, which is installed during a separate operation, after which a brief commissioning process places the PB3 into operation. Recent deployments include off the coast of Kozushima Island, Japan for MES in April 2017 and in the Adriatic Sea for Eni in November 2018. The Company is planning to deploy in August 2019 a PB3 in the Central North Sea for PMO.
 
Product Insurance. We currently have a property loss and liability insurance policy underwritten by Lloyd’s Underwriters that covers the deployment and storage of our PowerBuoys®.
 
Site Approval. In the U.S., federal agencies regulate the siting of long-term renewable energy projects and related-uses located on the outer continental shelf (“OCS”), which is generally more than three miles offshore. OCS projects longer than one-year in duration are regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”). For projects located within three miles of the U.S. shore regardless of duration, the adjacent state would be responsible for issuing a lease and other required authorizations for the location of the project. In either case, an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the project would be conducted in addition to other requirements. Generally, the same process applies to foreign sites where site approval is contingent on meeting both national and local regulatory and environmental requirements. In connection with issuing permits or leases enabling project use, the respective government agency often requires site restoration or other activities at the conclusion of the permit or lease period.
 
Environmental Approval and Compliance. We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, in the U.S., the construction and operation of PowerBuoys® offshore would require permits and approvals from the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other governmental authorities. These required permits and approvals evaluate, among other things, whether a project is in the public interest and ensure that the project would not create a hazard to navigation. Other foreign and international laws may require similar approvals. We provide you with additional information under “Regulation” below.
 
Research and Development
 
Our team has a broad range of experience in mechanical, electrical, and ocean engineering. We have engaged in extensive efforts to develop the PowerBuoy®, improve PowerBuoy® efficiency, reliability and power output, and improve manufacturability while reducing cost and complexity. Our recent efforts have been focused on optimizing our PowerBuoys® in order to balance customer cost (both capital and operating expenses) with power output of our PowerBuoys®. Such efforts include the development of scalable, higher efficiency, lower cost, higher reliability and less customized PTO systems, and the use of higher energy density and lower weight energy storage technologies. We continue to seek to increase the capabilities of our PowerBuoy® systems by designing flexible interfaces and rendering them sensor and payload agnostic.
 
We have also focused on the development and implementation of accelerated testing regimens and techniques known as accelerated life testing. Such methods accelerate failures in a laboratory environment, as compared to more lengthy and expensive full-scale ocean deployments during normal use and extreme conditions. This testing allows us to quantify the life characteristics of critical components and subsystems which would normally require several years of operation in ocean conditions to achieve similar levels of wear and tear. Accelerated life testing is used successfully in other industries such as automotive and aerospace and is a critical enabler for rapid product and technology development and maturation.
 
It is our intent to fund the majority of our future research and development expenses with sources of external funding, including cost sharing obligations under customer contracts. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to secure additional contracts. If we are unable to obtain external funding, we may curtail our research and development expenses or reduce the scope of our operations as necessary to lower our operating costs.

In addition to improving and optimizing our PB3 PowerBuoy® we have spent considerable effort in developing two new complementary products, the hybrid PowerBuoy®, and subsea battery solutions. These products build on our existing expertise in offshore power systems and are targeted for first deployment in Fall 2019.
 

● | hybrid PowerBuoy® - The Company is in the process of creating a hybrid PowerBuoy® that will be a smaller liquid-fueled surface buoy, compared to the wave power based PB3 PowerBuoy®, capable of providing reliable power in remote offshore locations. This product is to be highly complementary to the PB3 PowerBuoy® by providing the Company the opportunity to address a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, with the potential for greater Company integration within each customer project. It is primarily intended for shorter term deployment applications such as eROV and AUV inspections and short-term maintenance, topside surveillance and communications, and subsea equipment and controls. The hybrid PowerBuoy® is anticipated to be a lightweight, quickly deployable and cost-effective solution. The design is also anticipated to have a high payload capacity for communications and surveillance, with the capability of being tethered to subsea payloads and battery packs or with a conventional anchor mooring system. The Company intends to design the hybrid PowerBuoy®, with a Stirling engine, to outperform traditional diesel buoys, which we believe to have more frequent service and refueling intervals. We believe the hybrid PowerBuoy® will be able to operate in an environmentally safer manner using more robust fuels, while operating over a wider temperature range than diesel buoys.

● | Subsea battery solutions - The Company is in the process of creating a sea floor energy storage solution for remote offshore operations. These subsea battery systems will contain lithium ion batteries, which provide high power density, to supply power that can enable subsea equipment, sensors, communications, AUVs and electric remotely operated vehicles (eROV) recharge. The Company’s PB3 PowerBuoy® is complimentary to subsea battery systems by providing a means for recharging during longer term deployments, or the subsea battery systems can be used independently for shorter term deployments. Ideal for many remote offshore customer applications, these subsea battery systems are anticipated to be high performance, cost-efficient, and quickly deployable. Given the Company’s expertise in offshore energy storage systems from existing PB3 PowerBuoy® technology, the subsea battery solutions will provide an opportunity for the Company to differentiate through technical, cost and delivery leadership.

Commercial Activities
 
We continue to seek new strategic relationships, and further develop our existing partnerships, with other companies that have developed or are developing in-ocean applications requiring a persistent source of power that is also capable of real time data collection, processing and communication, to address potential customer needs.
 
The table below shows the percentage of our revenue we derived from significant customers for the periods indicated:
 

 | Twelve months ended April 30, | 
----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+----
 | 2019 | | | 2018
Eni S.p.A. | | 54 | % | | 33 | %
Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding | | 0 | % | | 43 | %
Premier Oil UK Limited | | 33 | % | | 10 | %
Office of Naval Research | | 0 | % | | 14 | %
Other | | 13 | % | | 0 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
In order to achieve success in commercializing our products, we must expand our customer base and obtain commercial contracts to lease or sell our PowerBuoy® and related services to customers. Our potential customer base for our PowerBuoys® includes various public and private entities, and agencies that require remote offshore power. To date, substantially all of our revenue producing contracts have been with a small number of customers under contracts to fund a portion of the costs of our operational efforts to develop and improve our technology, validate our product through ocean and laboratory testing, and business development activities with potential commercial customers. Our goal in the future is that an increased portion of our revenues will be from the lease or sale of our products and related maintenance and other services.

Historic Projects
 
Our relationships and projects during recent years include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | The U.S. Navy and Department of Homeland Security. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


In 2012, we executed a CRADA with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to collaborate and demonstrate persistent maritime vessel detection. The vessel detection ocean demonstration in 2013 utilized the same PowerBuoy® under the LEAP contract with additional sensors. This additional deployment provided critical data which informed our next design iteration, and which incorporated major modifications to address critical operations and reliability improvements. This project concluded in 2013. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 2009 to 2011, we ocean-tested our utility-scale PowerBuoy® at the U.S. Marine Corps Base, Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay. The PowerBuoy® was launched under our program with the U.S. Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of a prior iteration of our PowerBuoy®, including connection to the Oahu power grid. 
In 2009 and 2010, we were awarded $2.4 million and $2.75 million, respectively, from the U.S. Navy to develop a Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy® (“LEAP”) prototype. The LEAP contract was developed to enhance the U.S. Navy’s territorial protection capability by providing potential persistent power at sea for port maritime surveillance in the near coast, harbor, piers and offshore areas. During the LEAP contract, we designed, built and deployed in 2011 a PowerBuoy® structure incorporating a new PTO system. The system was deployed by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel and was ocean-tested approximately 20 miles off the coast of New Jersey. It was integrated with a Rutgers University-operated land-based radar network that provided ocean current mapping data for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) and U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue (“SAR”) operations. The ocean test of the LEAP vessel detection system demonstrated dual-use capability of the radar network and helped to verify our technology as a potential persistent power source for systems requiring remote power at sea. During the ocean testing under these contracts, our PowerBuoy® withstood the high storm waves of Hurricane Irene which occurred in August 2011. 
From 2007 to 2013, we worked on two separate contracts to fabricate and deploy two autonomous PowerBuoys®, which were subsequently deemed obsolete, as an alternate power source for the U.S. Navy’s Deep Water Active Detection System (“DWADS”). 


● | Lockheed Martin. From 2004 to 2014, we had several project teaming agreements and license agreements with Lockheed Martin. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Australia. In 2008, we announced a Joint Development Agreement with Leighton Contractors Pty. Ltd. (“Leighton”) for the development of wave power projects off the coast of Australia. In 2009, Leighton formed Victorian Wave Partners Pty Ltd (“VWP”), a special purpose company for the development of a wave power project off the coast of Victoria, Australia. In 2010, VWP and the Commonwealth of Australia entered into an Energy Demonstration Program Funding Deed (“Funding Deed”), wherein VWP was awarded an A$66.5 million (approximately US$62 million) grant for the wave power project. However, receipt of funds under the grant was subject to certain terms, including achievement of future significant external funding milestones. The grant was expected to be used towards the A$232 million proposed cost of building and deploying a wave power station off the coast of Australia (the “Project”). In March 2012, our Australian subsidiary Ocean Power Technologies (Australasia) Pty. Ltd acquired 100% ownership of VWP from Leighton. In January 2014, VWP signed a Deed of Variation with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (“ARENA”) that amended the Funding Deed, and, in March 2014, received the initial portion of the grant from ARENA in the amount of approximately A$5.6 million (approximately US$5.2 million) (the “Initial Funding”). The Initial Funding was subject to claw-back provisions if certain contractual requirements, including performance criteria, were not satisfied. In light of the claw-back provisions, we determined to classify the Initial Funding as an advance payment, hold the funds as restricted cash and defer recognition of the funds as revenue. In July 2014, the VWP Board of Directors determined that the project contemplated by the Funding Deed was no longer commercially viable and terminated the Funding Deed. The Initial Funding was returned to ARENA. We do not currently have any projects in Australia.

● | Reedsport, Oregon Project. We obtained a permit in 2007 from the Federal Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) for a multi-stage wave power project off the coast of Reedsport, Oregon. In addition, we received two cost-sharing contracts with the DOE for approximately $4.4 million to construct and deploy a single PowerBuoy® off the coast of Reedsport. We subsequently obtained a license from FERC in August 2012 that authorized installation and operation of a 10-buoy grid connected wave energy array (the “License”). Due to the complexity of the FERC regulations for the single buoy, higher than anticipated project costs, unanticipated technical risks, and uncertainty surrounding permitting, we made the decision not to proceed with the project. Accordingly, we announced in March 2014 our surrender of the permit for one phase of the project and announced in April 2014 that we were taking the steps necessary to close out this project with the DOE. In May 2014, we filed an application to surrender the FERC permit for the remaining phases. In August 2014, in cooperation with the State of Oregon Department of State Lands, we removed anchoring and mooring equipment from the seabed off the coast of Oregon. In fiscal 2016, we dispositioned the PowerBuoy®. In late fiscal 2016 and early fiscal 2017, we disposed of the remaining anchoring and mooring equipment through a local entity and by June 2017 the project was closed out. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PowerBuoy® Development Projects. In April 2010, we received a $1.5 million award from the DOE for a feasibility study of a PowerBuoy® with the ability to produce up to 500kW of power (referred to as the “PB500”). In fiscal 2011, we received additional awards totaling $4.7 million for the PB500 structure and PTO optimization study, $2.3 million from the U.K. Government’s Technology Strategy Board and $2.4 million from the DOE. In fiscal 2014, upon completion of the concept design and associated trade studies that included detailed mechanical analyses, manufacturability and overall projected performance, the study concluded that a PB500 would not be technically feasible or economically viable. In March 2015, we successfully completed a stage gate review and a review of project deliverables with the DOE where advancements related to PTO design aspects such as reliability, cost take out, manufacturability and scalability were reviewed. Following a stage gate review, the project was successfully completed in fiscal 2016. 

Manufacturing
 
We engage in two types of manufacturing activities: 1) the manufacturing of the high value-added PTO components for systems control, power generation and conversion, and energy storage for each PowerBuoy®; and 2) contracting with outside companies for the fabrication of the buoy structure, mooring system, and cabling.

14
--


Our core in-house manufacturing activity is the assembly, final systems integration and testing of the PTO and its components, which is conducted at our New Jersey facility. The power generation system consists of electro-mechanical components, and the control modules include the critical electrical and electronic systems that convert the mechanical energy into usable electricity. The sensors and control systems use sophisticated technology to optimize the performance of the PowerBuoy® in response to changing operating conditions and payload power demand. We maintain a portfolio of patents, including those that cover our power generation, power conversion and control technologies.
 
We purchase the remaining components and materials for each PowerBuoy® from various vendors. We provide specifications to each vendor, and they are responsible for performing quality analysis and quality control over the course of construction, subject to our review of the quality and test procedure results. After the vendor completes the testing of the buoy structure, it is transported to our facility for final integration of the PTO. After each vendor completes testing of the remaining components, they are transported ready-to-install to the project site. We do not believe that we are dependent on any single vendor for manufacturing the components of and materials for our PowerBuoy®, and we believe that there are many available manufacturers for our component parts if a particular manufacturing partner should become unavailable or expensive. However, we have only manufactured our PowerBuoys® in limited quantities for use in development and testing and have limited commercial manufacturing experience, and our work with our vendors has not included work on multiple orders on time-critical deadlines. Moreover, we do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers or vendors. In order to be successful in our efforts to commercialize our PowerBuoys®, we will need to secure stable relationships with a variety of manufacturers and vendors that can supply component parts and materials for our PowerBuoy® products.
 
In December 2017, we relocated our corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations from Pennington, New Jersey to Monroe, New Jersey. Our new facility offers approximately 56,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space, which is more than double the size of our prior facility. This larger space supports our increased operational needs, and also allows for our anticipated growth over the next several years. We believe this new facility will enable us to implement world class assembly and testing processes, emphasizing product quality and employee safety, while significantly improving our ability to increase product throughput. We believe that our decision to relocate our operations is integral to our overall business growth strategy.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We continue to enhance our marketing capabilities across our target markets and we have begun actively marketing our PowerBuoys®. We currently use a direct sales force consisting of employees and industry expert consultants. Because our PowerBuoys® use technology which is not yet considered mature by our target markets, we expect that the customer decision process could require us to spend substantial time educating end-users and stakeholders, which may result in a lengthy sales cycle.
 
We attend and display our products at trade shows and conferences that represent our pursued markets. In May 2019, the Company was an exhibitor at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston, Texas. In May 2019, the Company was an exhibitor at the U.S. Navy League’s Sea-Air-Space Exposition in National Harbor, Maryland. In August 2018, the Company was an exhibitor at the Offshore North Sea 2018 Conference in Stavanger, Norway. In May 2018, we displayed our full-size PB3 PowerBuoy® at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston, Texas. In April 2018, we highlighted our Anchorless PowerBuoy® at the Navy Forum for SBIR/STTR Transition in National Harbor, Maryland.
 
We market our PowerBuoys® to companies and entities requiring remote offshore power and communications; for example, oil and gas companies for potential applications such as remote sensing, trace heating, or autonomous site monitoring, power and communications for remotely operated vehicles or autonomous underwater vehicle charging stations. We also see opportunities for defense and security applications using active sensors such as high frequency radar and acoustic systems with significant processing and communications requirements.
 
Additionally, we continue to seek to enter into strategic relationships to develop application solutions with commercial and military sensor and equipment manufacturers, where we might grant licenses to manufacture, market or operate PowerBuoys® or PowerBuoy® subsystems.

Backlog
 
As of April 30, 2019, our backlog was $0.9 million. Our backlog can include both funded amounts, which are unfilled firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer (U.S. Congress, in the case of U.S. Government agencies), and unfunded amounts, which are unfilled firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract.
 
The amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards.
 
Competition
 
We expect to compete with other providers of in-ocean autonomous power sources, primarily consisting of subsea batteries, solar and fossil-fuel power sources, where many of the providers are substantially larger than OPT and may have access to greater financial resources. Incumbent sources of in-ocean power may also represent established and reliable power sources and may have already gained customer acceptance. Our ability to compete successfully for business from applications seeking in-ocean power will depend on our ability to produce and store energy reliably and at a total cost that is competitive with or lower than that of other sources, and on the on-going reliability of our product and customer perception of our company. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by our current need for additional financing and our future customers’ concerns about our long-term viability.
 
We also may eventually compete against other renewable wave generated power providers. As of June 2018, there were more than nearly 260 companies, some with institutional funding, listed in the DOE’s Marine and Hydrokinetic (“MHK”) Technology Database. This DOE database provides up-to-date information on marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies and companies, both in the U.S. and around the world. Many of these companies are located in the U.K., continental Europe, Japan, Israel, the U.S. and Australia, and many of those companies are pursuing the utility, grid-connected energy market. The MHK industry is both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to differentiate themselves by promoting their specific technology focusing on cost and efficiency. The companies are subdivided by implementation: wave power, current power, tidal and ocean thermal energy conversion. Within wave power, the technologies are classified as point absorber, oscillating wave column, overtopping device, attenuator and oscillating wave surge converter. Our PowerBuoy® wave energy converter is classified as a point absorber.
 
The vast majority of the companies in the DOE’s database are small, start-up type companies with a small number of employees and in early stage development that do not have our in-ocean validation experience. Only a few of these companies have conducted testing similar to us, such as accelerated life testing and extensive wave tank testing on reduced scale models of their devices. We believe our in-ocean experience is critical in proving the reliability, survivability and performance of any wave energy system, which we believe our future customers will require before adopting any wave generated energy solution. We believe our experience gained through full scale in-ocean deployments, coupled with other types of factory and laboratory testing, and our resulting understanding of risks and failure modes provides us with an advantage compared to potential wave energy competitors.
 
Our analysis of the DOE database indicates that approximately 20 wave energy technologies were selected for further evaluation by the DOE, primarily based on company financial capability, type of system and potential to compete in autonomous (non-grid connected) markets. Of these, there are three companies that we believe may have the technical capability and financial viability to compete in the offshore autonomous power market; however, their technologies are still in early stage development with limited ocean testing. We believe that none of these technologies are at the maturity level of our current PB3 PowerBuoy®, and because of this we believe that we continue to maintain a first mover advantage.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our technology differentiates us from other providers of wave energy conversion technologies. As a result, our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation and may rely on licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
As of June 2019, we have been issued 66 U.S. patents, of which 47 are active and 18 have expired and 1 was abandoned. Outside of the U.S. we have been issued 237 patents across 13 countries with 37 of the active U.S. patents having at least one corresponding issued foreign patent. We have filed for 4 additional U.S. patents and none of the U.S. patents applications have corresponding foreign patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to:
 

● | system design; 
--+-------------------------------
● | control systems; 
● | power conversion; 
● | anchoring and mooring; and 
● | wave farm architecture. 

 
The expiration dates for our issued U.S. patents range from 2019 to 2037. We do not consider any single patent or patent application that we hold to be material to our business. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in continuing to obtain effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. In addition, certain technologies that we developed with U.S. federal government funding are subject to certain government rights as described in “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
We use trademarks on nearly all our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products. We have registered our PB-Vue ®, OPTMicrobuoy ®, CellBuoy ®, PowerTower ®, Making Waves in Power ®, Talk on Water ® and ® marks in the United States. Trademark ownership is generally of indefinite duration when marks are properly maintained in commercial use.
 
Regulation
 
Our PowerBuoys® are subject to regulation in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning, among other areas, site approval and environmental approval and compliance. In order to encourage the adoption of offshore power solutions, many governments offer subsidies and other financial incentives and have mandated renewable energy targets which some of our customers may be able to leverage. However, these subsidies, incentives and targets may not be applicable to our technology and therefore may not be available to our customers.
 
The renewable energy industry has also been subject to increasing regulation. As the renewable energy industry continues to evolve and as the wave energy industry continues to evolve, we anticipate that wave energy technology and our PowerBuoys® and their deployment will be subject to increased oversight and regulation in accordance with international, national and local regulations relating to safety, sites, and environmental protection.
 
Site Approval, Environmental Approval and Compliance
 
We present additional information regarding the regulatory requirements relating to our in-ocean deployments above, under “Product and Technologies - Deployments.”

--

Subsidies and Incentives
 
Renewable energy subsidies and incentives are generally applicable only to electric generation and supply to the utility grid. However, our autonomous applications may permit a customer to reduce its carbon emissions, which our potential customers may be able to publicize in their environmental stewardship reports.
Employees
 
As of April 30, 2019, we had 39 full-time employees. Of these employees, 38 are located in the United States and one is located in the United Kingdom. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are good.
