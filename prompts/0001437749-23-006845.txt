GENERAL
 
ALPHA PRO TECH, LTD. (“Alpha Pro Tech,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is the parent company of Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. and Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 1994 as a successor to a business that was organized in 1983. Our executive offices are located at 60 Centurian Drive, Suite 112, Markham, Ontario, Canada L3R 9R2, and our telephone number is (905) 479-0654. Our website is located at www.alphaprotech.com.
 
The Company continued to qualify as a smaller reporting company at the measurement date for determining such qualification during 2022. According to the disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies, the Company has included consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022.
 
BUSINESS
 
Alpha Pro Tech is in the business of protecting people, products and environments. We accomplish this by developing, manufacturing and marketing a line of high-value, disposable protective apparel and infection control products for the cleanroom, industrial, pharmaceutical, medical and dental markets through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. We also manufacture a line of building supply construction weatherization products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. Our products are sold under the Alpha Pro Tech brand name, as well as under private label.
 
Our products are grouped into two business segments: (1) the Building Supply segment, consisting of construction weatherization products, such as housewrap, housewrap accessories including window and door flashing, and seam tape, and synthetic roof underlayment, as well as other woven material; and (2) the Disposable Protective Apparel segment, consisting of disposable protective garments (including shoecovers, bouffant caps, coveralls, gowns, frocks and lab coats), face masks and face shields. All financial information presented in this report reflects the current segmentation.

STRATEGY
 
Our principal strategy focuses on developing, producing and marketing differentiated, innovative high value products that protect people, products and environments. Our key sales growth strategies are based on communicating directly with end users and developing innovative products to suit individual end users’ needs.
 
Our products are used primarily in cleanrooms, industrial safety manufacturing environments and health care facilities, such as hospitals, laboratories and dental offices, as well as residential and multi-family building and re-roofing sites. Our products are distributed principally in the United States of America (“United States” or “U.S.”) through a network consisting of purchasing groups, national distributors, local distributors, independent sales representatives, and our own sales and marketing force.
 
PRODUCTS

Our principal products are grouped into two business segments:
 
Building Supply:
 ●    Housewrap
 ●    Housewrap accessories: window and door flashing and seam tape
 ●    Synthetic roof underlayment
 ●    Other woven material
 
Disposable Protective Apparel:
 ●    Shoecovers
 ●    Bouffant caps
 ●    Gowns
 ●    Coveralls
 ●    Lab coats
 ●    Frocks
 ●    Face masks
 ●    Face shields
 
Building Supply
 
The Building Supply segment consists of a line of construction supply weatherization products, namely housewrap, housewrap accessories and synthetic roof underlayment, as well as other woven material. This line of products is a natural extension of our core capabilities: creating proprietary products designed to protect people and environments.
 
The usage of these construction supply weatherization products offers great advantages in decreasing the time that it takes to construct a home, as well as reducing costs. The housewrap, under the trademark REX™, offers a weather resistant barrier and, to the homeowner, years of lower energy consumption. REX Wrap® and REX Wrap Plus® are woven and coated polypropylene micro perforated weather resistant barriers, and REX™ Wrap Fortis with JX ALTA 360° Drainage Technology™ is a one-of-a-kind breathable product that uniquely enables the drainage of water in every direction to protect buildings from the elements much better, we believe, than a traditional housewrap, while decreasing job site material waste, simplifying installation to reduce labor and allowing fewer products to be carried onto the job site. Our housewrap accessories includes REXTREME Window and Door Flashing, which provides a tight seal from air and moisture around windows and doors and REX™ Premium Seam Tape which is a high-strength film that helps to seal all seams on housewrap applications.
 
The proprietary synthetic roof underlayment, REX SynFelt®, has the ability to resist the environment, as opposed to conventional organic roofing underlayment that is prone to rapid degradation and mold growth. We also manufacture and distribute REX TECHNOply® and TECHNO SB®, economy versions of our synthetic roof underlayment, to capture market share in the lower end of the market. These products are manufactured in our manufacturing facility in Valdosta, Georgia and through our joint venture in India, as described in more detail below under “Manufacturing.”
 
Disposable Protective Apparel
 
The Disposable Protective Apparel segment consists of a complete line of disposable protective garments (shoecovers, bouffant caps, coveralls, gowns, frocks and lab coats), as well as face masks and face shields.
 
Our goal in the design and manufacture of all our disposable protective garments is to keep the wearer cool, clean and comfortable and to provide the right level of protection for the wearer and the wearer’s environment. To achieve this, we offer a comprehensive selection of materials and garment designs to meet a wide range of application requirements. Our materials are clean and durable and offer the wearer a great comfort level. Our products are offered using proprietary materials such as ChemTech®, BarrierTech®, ComforTech®, AlphaGuard® and GenPro®, UltraGrip™, SafeStep®, MaxGrip®, AquaTrak®, SureGrip®, NuTech® and NaviTrak®.

The vast majority of the disposable protective garments are manufactured through our joint venture in India, and, to a much lesser extent, by other contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, as described in more detail below under “Manufacturing.” Certain proprietary products are made using materials supplied by us.
 
Our face masks come in a wide variety of filtration efficiencies and styles. Our patented Positive Facial Lock® feature provides a custom fit to the face to prevent blow-by for better protection. The term "blow-by" is used to describe the potential for infectious material to enter or escape a face mask without going through the filter as a result of gaps or openings in the face mask. Our Magic Arch® feature holds the mask away from the nose and mouth, creating a comfortable breathing chamber.
 
Our N-95 Particulate Respirator National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (“NIOSH”) approved face mask, which incorporates both the Positive Facial Lock® feature and the Magic Arch® feature, has historically experienced increased demand during outbreaks of infectious disease, such as SARS in 2003, Bird Flu in 2006, H1N1 in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020, to combat the spread of these diseases.
 
All eye shields are made from an optical-grade polyester film and have a permanent anti-fog feature. This provides the wearer with extremely lightweight, distortion-free protection that can be worn for hours, and the eye shields will not fog up from humidity and/or perspiration. An important feature of all face masks and eye and face shields is that they are disposable, which eliminates the possibility of cross infection between patients and saves consumers, such as hospitals, the expense of sterilization after every use.
 
As described in more detail below under “Manufacturing,” our face masks are primarily manufactured in our facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our eye shields are produced in our facility in Nogales, Arizona and assembled by a subcontractor in Mexico.
 
All of our disposable protective apparel products, including face masks and face shields, are sold through similar distribution channels, are single-use and disposable, have the purpose of protecting people, products and environments, and have to be produced in Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved facilities, regardless of the market served.
 
The Company’s products are sold under the “Alpha Pro Tech” brand name and under private label, and they are predominantly sold in the U.S.
 
Financial information related to the two segments can be found in Activity of Business Segments (Note 15) of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
 
MARKETS
 
Our products are sold to the following markets: (i) construction weatherization products (building supply products) are sold to construction supply and roofing distributors, and (ii) disposable protective apparel products are sold to the industrial, cleanroom, medical and dental markets.
 
Our target customers are construction building supply and roofing distributors, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing, medical device manufacturing, lab animal research, high technology electronics manufacturing (which includes the semi-conductor market), and medical and dental distributors.
 
DISTRIBUTION
 
We rely primarily on a network of independent distributors for the sale of our products.
 
We generally do not have a material amount of backlog orders, as orders are usually placed for shipment and shipped within 30 days. Appropriate levels of inventories are maintained to supply distributors on a timely basis. From time to time, we will stockpile inventory for periods of unusually high demand.
 
Disruptions in the supply chain as well as unpredictable changes in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic have created occasional backlogs of unfulfilled orders for our personal protective equipment (“PPE”) products and certain of our building supply products, and uncertainty in the timing of deliveries and fulfillment of backlogged orders can occur from time to time.
 
Standard payment terms are net 30 days from the date of shipment. All pricing and payment for our products are in U.S. dollars. Authorized returns must be unopened, in good condition and in the original carton and may be returned within 90 days of the original date of shipment. All authorized returns are subject to a restocking fee of 20% of the original invoice.

MANUFACTURING
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc., manufactures and distributes a line of construction weatherization products for the Building Supply segment, comprised primarily of housewrap and synthetic roof underlayment. Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. operates in a 165,400 square foot facility in Valdosta, Georgia.
 
Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. has a 41.66% ownership interest in a joint venture with Maple Industries and associates, a manufacturer in India, for the production of Building Supply segment products, such as housewrap and synthetic roof underlayment products, in a semi-finished state, and the production of Disposable Protective Apparel segment products. The name of the joint venture is Harmony Plastics Private Limited (“Harmony”). For a description of our relationship with Harmony see Note 7 to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Harmony has four facilities in India, three owned and one rented. The owned facilities consist of (i) a 139,000 square foot building for use in the manufacturing of building products, (ii) a 121,000 square foot facility for use in the manufacturing of coated material and the sewing of proprietary disposable protective apparel, and (iii) a 23,000 square foot facility for use in the sewing of proprietary disposable protective apparel. The rented building is a 159,000 square foot facility for use in the manufacturing of Building Supply segment products.
 
We cut, warehouse and ship disposable protective apparel products and face shields in a 60,000 square foot facility in Nogales, Arizona. The majority of the apparel products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in Asia and, to a much lesser extent, the face shields are manufactured by a contract manufacturer in Mexico. These goods are manufactured pursuant to our specifications and quality assurance guidelines. Certain proprietary products are being made in Asia using materials supplied by us.
 
Our mask production facility is located in a 34,500 square foot building in Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
We have encountered over the last three years a number of constraints within our supply chain due to raw material and labor shortages, as well as shipping delays. At times, these constraints have limited our ability to satisfy customer demand. Although we continue to work to alleviate these supply chain issues by securing additional supply sources, in the event of subsequent shutdowns, shortages or delays, our production and sales could be further impacted. Our business is not subject to significant seasonal considerations, although it is necessary for us to have adequate raw materials and finished inventory in stock.

COMPETITION 
 
We face substantial competition from numerous companies, including many companies with greater marketing and financial resources. Our major competitors in the construction supply weatherization market are DuPont and Berry Global for housewrap and Owens Corning and GAF for synthetic roof underlayment. Our major competitor in the medical and dental markets is Kimberly-Clark Corporation of Fort Worth, Texas. Other large competitors include 3M Company, Johnson & Johnson, White Knight Engineered Products (Precept Medical Products, Inc.), Cardinal Health, Inc. and Medline Industries Inc. Our major competitors in the industrial and cleanroom market are our former largest distributor, VWR International, LLC, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, 3M Company, Kappler, Inc., DuPont and Allegiance Healthcare Corporation. VWR International, LLC, Cardinal Health, Inc. and Medline Industries Inc. are also distributors of our products. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully, driven by the combination of our brand and product dependability and quality, manufacturing capabilities, and product innovations, as well as on the breadth of our offerings to customers.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
 
We are not required to obtain regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA with respect to the sale of our products. Our products are, however, subject to prescribed good manufacturing practices as defined by the FDA, and our manufacturing facilities are inspected by the FDA every two years to ensure compliance with such good manufacturing practices. We are marketing an N-95 Particulate Respirator face mask that meets the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) respirator guidelines and has been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This product is designed to help prevent the inhalation of the tuberculosis bacteria.
 
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations, and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health, and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. We are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health, and safety matters, and we currently have no anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 
Patents
 
Our policy is to protect our intellectual property rights, products, designs and processes through the filing of patents in the United States and, where appropriate, in Canada and other countries. At present, we have ten United States patents relating to several of our products. In addition, we have a United States patent on a method to fold and put on sterile garments. We believe that our patents may offer a competitive advantage, but there can be no assurance that any patents, issued or in process, will not be circumvented or invalidated. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to maintain and develop our commercial position. The United States patents issued have an average remaining duration of approximately 1.2 years before expiration.
Trademarks
 
Many of our products are sold under various trademarks and trade names, including Alpha Pro Tech. We believe that many of our trademarks and trade names have significant recognition in our principal markets, and we take customary steps to register or otherwise protect our rights in our trademarks and trade names.

None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Workplace Health and Safety
 
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested, and will continue to do so. The Company maintains a variety of programs to reduce and eliminate injuries and promote safety and regularly measures progress against those programs. These programs promote personal responsibility for workplace safety and encourage associates to set a meaningful example as safety ambassadors.
