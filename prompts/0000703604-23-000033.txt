DSG Vision and Strategic Focus
The complementary distribution operations of Lawson, TestEquity and Gexpro Services were combined for the purpose of creating a specialty distribution company enabling each of Lawson, TestEquity and Gexpro Services to maintain their respective high-touch, value-added service delivery models and customer relationships in their specialty distribution businesses under the leadership of their separate business unit management. The DSG leadership team provides oversight to the separate leadership teams of each of the operating companies. This structure enables the combined company to leverage best practices, back-office resources and technologies across the three operating companies to help drive cost synergies and efficiencies. The combined company has the ability to utilize its combined financial resources to accelerate a strategy of expansion through both business acquisitions and organic growth.
Organic Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our revenue organically and further improve our operations by exploring growth opportunities that provide different channels to reach customers, increase revenue and generate positive results. We plan to utilize our company structure to grow organic revenue by collaborative selling across our customer bases and expanding the digital capabilities across our platform.
Acquisition Strategy
In addition to organic growth, we plan to actively pursue acquisition opportunities complementary to our businesses that we believe will be financially accretive to our organization.
Recent Other Acquisitions — During 2022, other businesses were acquired as part of the growth strategy. TestEquity acquired Interworld Highway, LLC for $54.7 million, National Test Equipment for $7.2 million, and Instrumex for $3.9 million. Gexpro Services acquired Resolux ApS ("Resolux") for $30.8 million and Frontier Technologies Brewton, LLC and Frontier Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. ("Frontier") for $25.7 million. The consideration exchanged for these acquired businesses included various combinations of cash, sellers notes, and forms of share based payments. For more information about these acquisitions, refer to the "Other Acquisitions" section of Note 3 – Business Acquisitions in Item 8. Financial Statements.
Human Capital Resources - General Employee Information
Our organization supports a culture of continuous improvement and emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of our customers. We require our employees to act with integrity in every aspect of our business while encouraging them to be results driven, team oriented and progressive. 
As of December 31, 2022, our combined workforce included approximately 3,100 individuals, comprised of approximately 1,646 in sales and marketing, approximately 1,189 in operation and distribution and approximately 298 in management and administration. Approximately 1,720 individuals are within Lawson, 554 are within TestEquity, 684 are within Gexpro Services, with the remaining in corporate or other non-reportable segments.
Segments
The Company’s three reportable segments are (i) Lawson, (ii) Gexpro Services and (iii) TestEquity, which align with our principle operating businesses. The following is a discussion of these reportable segments. For more information about our segments, please refer to Note 14 – Segment Information in Item 8. Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Lawson
Lawson is a distributor of products and services to the industrial, commercial, institutional and governmental MRO marketplace. Lawson primarily distributes MRO products to its customers through a network of sales representatives throughout the United States and Canada.
Background and Operations — Lawson delivers quality products to customers and offers them extensive product knowledge, product application expertise and Vendor Managed Inventory ("VMI") services. Lawson competes for business 
7 


primarily by offering a value-added service approach wherein highly trained sales representatives manage the product inventory for customers. The VMI model makes it less likely that customers will run out of a product while optimizing their inventory levels. Lawson ships products to its customers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
Strategic Focus — Lawson's vision is to be its customers' first choice for MRO solutions that improve their operating performance. Lawson plans to achieve its vision by working closely with customers to maintain and enhance their operations by providing them with quality products, superior service and innovative solutions and to grow both organically and through acquisitions.
Industry and Competition — The MRO market is comprised of companies that buy and stock products in bulk and supply these products to customers on an as needed basis. The customer benefits from our knowledge and the convenience of ordering smaller quantities maintained by us.
There is a significant amount of competitive fragmentation by geography and product within the industry. We encounter competition from several national distributors and manufacturers and a large number of regional and local distributors. Some competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, handle more extensive lines of merchandise, operate larger facilities and price some merchandise more competitively than we do. 
Customers — During 2022, the Lawson segment sold products to over 67,000 distinct customers. Lawson's largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of consolidated revenue. In 2022, approximately 91% of Lawson's revenue was generated in the United States and approximately 9% in Canada. Although seasonality is not significant, due to fewer selling days and less activity during the holiday season, revenue in the fourth quarter is historically lower than the first three quarters of the year.
Lawson's customers operate in a variety of industries. Lawson's revenue percentages by customer end markets in 2022 were as follows:

Industry Category | Percentage of Lawson Revenue
Manufacturing | 22% 
Automotive | 18% 
Government and Military | 14% 
Construction | 8% 
Equipment rental | 6% 
Transportation | 4% 
Agriculture | 3% 
Mining | 3% 
Other | 22% 
 | 100% 

Lawson's customers include a wide range of purchasers of industrial supply products from small repair shops to large national and governmental accounts.

Products — Lawson's revenue percentages by product categories in 2022 were as follows:

Product Category | Percentage of Lawson Revenue
Fastening systems | 18% 
Fluid power | 15% 
Cutting tools and abrasives | 13% 
Specialty chemicals | 11% 
Electrical | 11% 
Aftermarket automotive supplies | 10% 
Safety | 4% 
Welding and metal repair | 1% 
Other | 17% 
 | 100% 

Lawson offers over 117,000 different products of which over 93,000 products are maintained in distribution centers. Lawson strives to carry sufficient inventory to ensure product availability and rapid processing of customer orders. Accurate forecasting of customer demand is essential to establish the proper level of inventory for each product. Inventory levels need to be sufficient to meet customer demand while avoiding the costs of stocking excess items. 
During 2022, Lawson purchased products from approximately 2,400 suppliers and no single supplier accounted for more than 6% of these purchases. The loss of one core supplier could affect operations by hindering the ability to provide full service to customers.
Lawson's quality control department tests its product offerings to help ensure they meet our customers' specifications. Lawson recommends solutions to help customers maximize product performance and avoid costly product failures. Lawson's engineering department provides technical support for products and offers on-site problem solutions. It also develops and presents product safety and technical training seminars tailored to meet customers' needs.
Human Capital Resources — As of December 31, 2022, Lawson's workforce was estimated to have 1,720 individuals: approximately 1,218 in sales and marketing of whom 1,000 are sales representatives, 386 in operation and distribution and 116 in management and administration. Approximately 11% of the Lawson workforce is covered by two collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees and their collective bargaining organizations are good.
Sales force growth is a driver of the Lawson business, and increased sales coverage throughout the United States and Canada directly impacts Lawson's success as an organization. Lawson is focused on identifying and recruiting individuals who are a good fit with its sales organization and providing them with the tools needed to succeed, such as training about Lawson's products and on the successful and effective ways to call potential customers and maintain relationships with existing customers. Lawson's product training educates its sales team on the optimal uses of products, enabling them to provide the proper products and customized solutions to address customers' needs, including technical expertise and on-site problem resolution. 
Lawson's leadership team is also focused on reducing sales force turn-over and on offering growth opportunities for our sales representatives.
TestEquity
TestEquity is a leading distributor of test and measurement equipment and solutions, electronic production supplies and tool kits from its leading manufacturing partners. TestEquity operates primarily through its five distribution brands, namely TestEquity, TEquipment, Techni-Tool, Jensen Tools and Instrumex, and is focused primarily in North America with a network of sales representatives throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany and the United Kingdom.

TEquipment (acquired as Interworld Highway, LLC) is one of the top distributors for both test and measurement and electronic production supplies in the United States with its e-commerce focused strategy, broad product range, amplified by access to core TestEquity products, and strong technical support for their customers. 
Techni-Tool is one of the industry’s largest solder, soldering equipment and electronic production distributors. Techni-Tool offers a wide range of products to support electronic production as well as compliance testing. In addition to the brand specific products offered, Techni-Tool also provides VMI solutions and dedicated technical support.

Jensen Tools employs a dedicated team of engineering, operational and sales professionals who focus on designing and building quality tool kits for its customers. 
Instrumex is a small refurbished test and measurement distributor, based in Munich Germany, with a global reach.
During the third quarter of 2022, the final stage of moving Techni-Tool and Jensen Tools to the TestEquity platform was completed. Customers for each of these brands now have full access to the 250,000 active products across TestEquity group.
Strategic Focus — TestEquity intends to grow revenue both organically and through acquisitions and continuing to expand and improve its service offerings to its customers. In particular, TestEquity strives to improve its digital experience, with a consistent approach for all of its brands. TestEquity intends to seek to increase its market share through continued expansion of product lines and greater penetration of the e-commerce market, enabled through investment in key digital talent and leverage of the existing TestEquity and TEquipment platforms.
Industry and Competition — Across both the test and measurement and electronic production supplies businesses, the North American market is fragmented with competitors ranging from large global distributors to national and regional distributors. Some competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, handle more extensive lines of merchandise, operate larger facilities and price some merchandise more competitively than TestEquity.
Customers — TestEquity serves over 30,000 customers at 100,000 locations across the United States and abroad, primarily in Canada and Europe, with approximately 92% of TestEquity’s revenue in 2022 derived from customers in the United States. TestEquity has expanded its business operations in the United Kingdom and Germany through its recent acquisitions of MCS Test equipment in July 2021 and Instrumex in December 2022. There is not significant seasonality in TestEquity’s business across its fiscal quarters. However, the number of business days in a quarter has an impact on TestEquity’s revenue and profitability.
TestEquity's revenue percentages by customer end markets in 2022 were as follows:

Industry Category | Percentage of TestEquity Revenue
Aerospace and defense | 30% 
Industrial electronics and electronics manufacturing | 26%
