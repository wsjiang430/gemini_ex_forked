------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a medical device company that is committed to providing highly effective, non-invasive and cost-effective treatments for both oncological and non-oncological skin conditions. We use a proprietary low-energy X-ray technology known as superficial radiation therapy (SRT), which is a result of over a decade of dedicated research and development. We have successfully incorporated SRT into our portfolio of treatment devices: the SRT-100TM, SRT-100+TM and SRT-100 VisionTM. To date, SRT technology has been used to effectively and safely treat oncological and non-oncological skin conditions in thousands of patients around the world. With the introduction of Sculptura™, we are branching out into cancer treatment that goes far beyond skin and will provide a revolutionary treatment option for patients around the world.
 
We completed an initial public offering in June 2016 and in February 2018, we opened a wholly owned subsidiary in Israel.
 
Our Products and Services 
 
SRT-100
 
The SRT-100 is a photon x-ray low energy superficial radiotherapy system that provides patients an alternative to surgery for treating non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids. The SRT-100 is especially effective in treating primary lesions that would otherwise be difficult or require extensive surgery involving sensitive areas of the head and neck regions, such as the fold in the nose, eyelids, lips, corner of the mouth, and the lining of the ear, that would otherwise lead to a less than desirable cosmetic outcome. Superficial radiation therapy treatment procedures do not require the use of anesthetics and eliminates the need for skin grafting. We believe that the SRT-100 provides healthcare providers and patients with a safe, virtually painless, and substantially non-scarring treatment option for non-melanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions, such as keloids. It allows dermatologists to retain non-melanoma skin cancer patients, rather than referring them to specialists, while offering radiation oncologists an alternative to costly linear accelerator–based treatments with a process that is less invasive, more time-efficient, and improves practice economics. Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our SRT-100 product line. The SRT-100 provides the following clinical and functional advantages:

● | Easy touch automatic set-up procedure, including automatic x-ray tube warm-up procedures; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Specially designed control console for medical physicists and service technicians which provides integrated safety and back-up timer controls, automatic system conditioning procedures, calibration, x-ray output verification and system parameters including last treatment status information; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advanced patient record management with integrated enterprise workflow management; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compact mobile design with a small 30” x 30” footprint and unique scissor x-ray tube arm movements providing a large range of motion for patient access and treatment; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High reliability and MTBF (mean time between failures) performance that assure availability for the patients and practitioners and lower the total cost of ownership. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SRT-100 Vision 
 
The SRT-100 Vision provides customers with additional options compared to the SRT-100 base model. These additional options allow for dedicated treatment planning and full treatment progression documentation in a patient’s record. The SRT-100 Vision provides the user with a unique superficial radiation therapy-tailored treatment planning application that integrates the embedded high frequency ultrasound imaging module, volumetric tumor analysis, beam margins planning, and comprehensive dosimetry parameters. This allows the user to precisely and more accurately plan and prescribe the patient-specific treatment course to maximize patient outcomes and workflow efficiency. The SRT-100 Vision also offers a comprehensive control console and workflow management that provides full record and treatment tracing, operator-level access and functional control, audio-visual patient and treated lesion monitoring, and advanced dosimetry setting and tracing.
SRT-100 Plus
 
In August 2018, we announced the FDA clearance of our SRT-100+. The SRT-100+ offers all the same features as the SRT-100, with the addition of:
 

● | An expanded energy range for customized, more precise treatment 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sculptura
 
In February 2019, we announced the FDA clearance of our Sculptura product, which is our proprietary robotic Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) system that uses patented Beam Sculpting™ capabilities to treat various cancers during surgery. This system has the potential to give surgeons and radiation oncologists at hospitals and cancer centers the ability to eliminate weeks of post-operative radiation treatments that patients typically must undergo after surgery and also result in similar or better outcomes to current radiation treatments today, with significantly less collateral damage. Sculptura has several exclusive features, including 3D Beam Sculpting™, respiratory motion tracking, embedded image guidance and treatment area illumination.
 
Sentinel service program 
 
We offer the Sentinel service program, which provides our customers comprehensive protection for their systems. The Sentinel service program covers all parts and labor for the period of the contract and one annual preventive maintenance session that includes cooling system maintenance, high voltage loop maintenance, filters and system cleaning, and system touch-ups, should they be required during the preventative maintenance session.
 
We also provide turnkey pre-and post-sale services that include the following:
 

● | Providing a pre-install kit for the contractors to prepare the treatment room; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Room retrofit and shielding;

Competition 
 
The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and is significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants. Our currently marketed products, and any future products we commercialize, will compete against healthcare providers who use traditional surgical treatment options, such as Mohs surgery, as well as medical device companies that offer other treatment options for the conditions our products are designed to treat. As of December 31, 2018, we had three primary medical device company competitors:

● | Xstrahl Medical (headquartered in the United Kingdom and with U.S. headquarters in Georgia) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Xoft (a subsidiary of iCAD, headquartered in New Hampshire) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Elekta (headquartered in Sweden and with U.S. headquarters in Georgia) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Xstrahl Medical primarily focuses on clinical and research x-ray therapy devices and solutions. We believe most of Xstrahl Medical’s installed base is comprised of higher energy devices located in Europe.
 
Both Xoft and Elekta offer products that are considered Electronic Brachytherapy (“eBx”) devices. Both eBx products have more limited capabilities than our products as to the size of lesions that can be treated as well as the energy levels that can be used, and require expensive consumables.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do, including relationships with our potential customers. In addition, many of these companies and healthcare providers have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do. Because of the size of the markets and the high growth profile of the products in which we compete, other companies may dedicate significant resources to developing competing products. Additionally, we may also face competition from smaller companies that have developed or are developing similar technologies for our addressable markets. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
 

● | improved outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+----------------------------------------------


● | acceptance by doctors treating non-melanoma skin cancer and keloids; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential greater acceptance by the patient community; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | potential greater ease of use and reliability; 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | product price and qualification for reimbursement; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | technical leadership and superiority; 
--+------------------------------------------


● | effective marketing and distribution; and 
--+----------------------------------------------


● | speed to market. 
--+---------------------

 
We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on the acceptance of our products by dermatologists, radiation oncologists, hospitals and patients, and our ability to achieve better clinical outcomes than products developed by our existing or future competitors. In addition, certain of our competitors could use their superior financial resources to develop products that have features or clinical outcomes similar or superior to our products, which would harm our ability to successfully compete.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We focus mainly on two primary markets, private dermatology practices and radiation oncologists in both private and hospital settings. We currently employ a multi-tier sales strategy to optimize geographic coverage and focus on what we perceive to be our key markets. This multi-tier sales model uses a direct sales force in the U.S., as well as international dealers and distributors. We plan to continue selling and marketing our products to both the dermatology and radiation oncology markets concurrently.

Dermatology Market 
 
Private dermatology practices in the U.S. represent the point of entry for most non-melanoma skin cancer patients. We believe the SRT-100 offers dermatologists a competitive advantage by allowing them to retain patients for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer, rather than referring them out to specialists for Mohs surgery or other radiation procedures. In addition to non-melanoma skin cancers, our FDA-approved indications include, among others, keloids, Kaposi’s Sarcoma, Actinic Keratosis, Metatypic Carcinoma, Cutaneous Appendage Carcinoma and other malignant skin tumors. Our SRT-100 is currently being used by over 100 U.S. dermatology practices in the treatment of keloids. Since our clearance in China in July 2017, it is also being used to treat Keloids in China. We are continuing to drive our research and development to expand our indications into new areas of treatment, including psoriasis.
Radiation Oncology Market 
 
For licensed radiation oncologists in the U.S., we believe the SRT-100 offers a simpler, faster method of treatment with a better overall patient experience. Our SRT-100 system offers oncologists the ability to free up more expensive radiation equipment, such as linear accelerators, for more complex procedures while providing patients with effective, non-invasive treatment options for non-melanoma skin cancer. Our Sculptura system has the potential to give surgeons and radiation oncologists at hospitals and cancer centers the ability to eliminate weeks of post-operative radiation treatments that patients have to undergo after surgery and also result in similar or better outcomes to current radiation treatments today, with much less collateral damage. Sculptura has several exclusive features, including 3D Beam Sculpting™ and respiratory motion tracking to the embedded image guidance and treatment area illumination.
Other Markets 
 
We also believe that both plastic and general surgery markets present growth opportunities for our product offerings. With FDA clearance to treat keloids through superficial radiation therapy, plastic surgeons are recognizing the opportunity to be able to provide an effective treatment solution for this benign tumor. Additionally, we believe that plastic surgeons view the non-melanoma skin cancer market as a growth opportunity that can supplement their existing services. We believe there is an opportunity to also provide superficial radiation therapy in a prophylactic manner for various surgical procedures to reduce the formation of keloids. Within the new healthcare reform environment, superficial radiation therapy can provide hospitals and surgery centers with a direct measurable impact on clinical outcomes for certain procedures, including joint replacement procedures, bypass surgery, and OBGYN/C-section procedures, among others.
Global Focus
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had an installed base of 395 units in 17 countries. Our customer list includes leading cancer centers, dermatology practices, hospitals and plastic surgery clinics, which we believe further validates our targeted marketing approach led by our direct sales teams and our global distribution partners.
Manufacturing and Supply 
 
We currently use a third party located in the U.S. to manufacture our products. In July 2010, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with RbM Services, LLC (“RbM”) pursuant to which RbM agreed to manufacture our SRT-100 products. We pay a fixed price per unit under the terms of this agreement, subject to annual adjustments due to changes in the cost of materials. The initial term of this agreement was three years with successive one-year renewals thereafter. We continue to do business with RbM, although we or RbM may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ written notice or upon at least 60 days’ notice prior to the end of each additional one-year renewal period. We believe our third party manufacturer meets FDA, International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and other quality standards. We maintain internal policies, procedures and supplier management processes to ensure that our third party manufacturer is meeting applicable quality standards. To date, we have not experienced any difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to meet the demand for our products, and we believe manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our products for the foreseeable future.

We believe this third party manufacturing relationship initially allowed us to work with a supplier that has well-developed specific competencies while minimizing our capital investment, controlling costs and shortening cycle times, all of which we believe allowed us to compete with our competitors. However, we are in the process of adding other third party manufacturers and exploring the possibility of bringing certain manufacturing functions in-house, which could include the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets or the acquisition or lease of a manufacturing facility.
 
We have a single preferred supplier for the x-ray tubes and other major components used in our products. We believe our preferred suppliers have superior products; however, we also believe that the products of alternate suppliers would be adequate for our products. Although we generally do not have a contractual relationship with our preferred suppliers we do not anticipate any material disruptions to our supply of major components. We believe that adequate supplies of major components are readily accessible from alternate suppliers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents that cover our products. We also rely on trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand.
 
We own two issued U.S. patents. Our patents pertain to technology in the specialized field of superficial radiotherapy treatment. The following patents were issued between August 2007 and September 2008 and were assigned to us when we acquired the technology from Topex:
 

● | U.S. Patent No. 7,372,940: Radiation therapy system with risk mitigation 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. Patent No. 7,263,170: Radiation therapy system featuring rotatable filter assembly 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The following patents were issued to us in 2018:
 

● | Russia Patent No. 26333322: Hybrid Ultrasound-Guided Superficial Radiotherapy System and Method 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | China Patent No. ZL201380013491.7: Hybrid Ultrasound-Guided Superficial Radiotherapy System and Method 

 
A total of 22 patent applications are pending and additional patent applications are in process.
 
We also own three U.S. trademark registrations and currently have eight trademark applications that are pending.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary rights to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our unpatented proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. We also require our employees to execute invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment.
 
No patents or trademarks may ever be issued or registered as a result of our pending or future applications for such intellectual property. Even if any such patents or trademarks are ultimately issued or registered, they, or any of our other intellectual property, may not provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. Our intellectual property could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, that we, our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change or new laws may be enacted. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers and suppliers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred approximately $1,039,000 and $866,000, respectively, in expenses related to regulatory compliance and quality standards.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulation of Medical Devices
 
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Our products include medical devices that are subject to these, as well as other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. FDA is responsible for the overall enforcement of quality, regulatory and statutory requirements governing medical devices. Our regulated medical devices include our SRT-100 product line.
 
FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes — Class I, Class II, or Class III — depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to assure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment determines the type of premarketing submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the U.S. Our devices are Class II devices under the FDA’s classification system.
 

● | Class I devices present a low risk and are not life-sustaining or life-supporting. The majority of Class I devices are subject only to “general controls” — e.g., prohibition against adulteration and misbranding, registration and listing, good manufacturing practices, labeling, and adverse event reporting. General controls are baseline requirements that apply to all classes of medical devices. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and “special controls” — e.g., special labeling, compliance with industry standards, and postmarket surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification (510(k)) process, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 807 requirements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III devices present the highest risk. These devices generally are life-sustaining, life-supporting, or for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class III devices are devices for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient and for which there is insufficient information to establish special controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are subject to general controls and typically require approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 814, before marketing. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially distributed in the U.S. The most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are 510(k) clearance and PMA. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, the availability of a de novo pathway was facilitated for certain low- to moderate-risk devices that do not qualify for the 510(k) pathway due to the absence of a predicate device.
 
510(k) pathway 
 
As of December 31, 2018, all of our products were subject to the 510(k) requirement or are exempt from the 510(k) requirement. The 510(k) review process compares a new device to an existing legally marketed device. Through the 510(k) process, the FDA determines whether the new medical device is “substantially equivalent” to the existing legally marketed device (i.e., predicate device) that is not subject to PMA requirements. “Substantial equivalence” means that the proposed new device: (a) has the same intended use as the predicate device; (b) has the same or similar technological characteristics as the predicate device; (c) has supporting information submitted in the 510(k) demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device; and (d) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a 510(k) application containing sufficient information and data to demonstrate that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. This data generally includes non-clinical performance testing (e.g., software validation, bench testing electrical safety testing), but may also include clinical data. Typically, it takes approximately four months for the FDA to complete its review of a 510(k) submission; however, it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. During its review of a 510(k), the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After completing its review of a 510(k), the FDA may issue an order, in the form of a letter, that finds the device to be either (1) substantially equivalent to the predicate device and states that the device can be marketed in the U.S., or (2) not substantially equivalent to the predicate device and states that device cannot be marketed in the U.S. Depending upon the reasons that the FDA finds the new device to not be substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the device may need to be approved through the PMA pathway (discussed below) prior to commercialization. A new medical device for which there is no substantially equivalent device is automatically designated a Class III device. Depending on the nature of the new device, the manufacturer may request the FDA to make a risk-based determination of the new device and to reclassify it as a Class I or Class II device. This process is referred to as the de novo process. If the FDA agrees, the new device will be reassigned to the appropriate other class. If the FDA does not agree, the manufacturer must submit a PMA prior to commercialization. We have received FDA 510(k) clearances for our SRT-100 and SRT-100 Vision.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, including significant modifications to any of our products, requires a new 510(k) clearance. The FDA relies on each manufacturer to make and document this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. We have made and plan to continue to make minor product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances. However, we expect to confer with the FDA on planned changes that may require a special, abbreviated or traditional 510(k) submission. If the FDA disagrees with our determination regarding whether a new 510(k) clearance was required for these modifications, we may need to cease marketing or recall the modified device. The FDA may also subject us to other enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning letter or untitled letter to us, seizing our products, imposing civil penalties, or initiating criminal prosecution.
 
Premarket approval pathway
 
As of December 31, 2018, we did not market any devices that were subject to PMA requirements. Unlike the 510(k) pathway, the PMA approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of a device before the device can be commercialized. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by FDA. PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. A PMA application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted with the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process.
 
After a PMA application is accepted for review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. FDA regulations provide 180 days to review the PMA and make a determination; however, the review time is typically longer (e.g., 1 – 3 years). During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside of the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to whether the data provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes comprehensive development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements for the design and manufacturing of a medical device.
 
Based on its review, the FDA may (1) issue an order approving the PMA, (2) issue a letter stating the PMA is “approvable” (e.g., minor additional information is needed), (3) issue a letter stating the PMA is “not approvable,” or (4) issue an order denying PMA. A device subject to PMA review cannot be marketed until the FDA issues an order approving the PMA. As part of a PMA approval, the FDA may impose post-approval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and requiring the collection of additional clinical data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 
Most modifications to a PMA approved device, including changes to the design, labeling, or manufacturing process, require prior approval before being implemented. Prior approval is obtained through submission of a PMA supplement. The type of information required to support a PMA supplement and the FDA’s time for review of a PMA supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification.

Clinical trials
 
Clinical trials of medical devices in the U.S. are governed by the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption regulation, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 812. This regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including, but not limited to, choosing qualified investigators, monitoring the trial, submitting required reports, maintaining required records, and assuring investigators obtain informed consent, comply with the study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, submit required reports, etc.
 
Clinical trials of significant risk devices (e.g., implants, devices used in supporting or sustaining human life, devices of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health) require FDA and Institutional Review Board approval prior to starting the trial. FDA approval is obtained through submission of an Investigational Device Exemption application. Clinical trials of non-significant risk devices (i.e. devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device) only require Institutional Review Board approval before starting. The clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination of whether a clinical study is significant risk or non-significant risk; however, a reviewing Institutional Review Board or the FDA may review this decision and disagree with the determination.
 
An Investigational Device Exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as performance data, animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound. There is no assurance that submission of an Investigational Device Exemption will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
As noted above, the FDA may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the post-market setting. The collection of such data may be required as a condition of PMA approval. FDA also has the authority to order, via a letter, a post-market surveillance study, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 822, for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved. We do not expect to launch clinical trials subject to the Investigational Device Exemption regulations for future products. Also, our products are not currently subject to any required post-market surveillance studies.
 
Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
 
After a device is entered into commerce in the U.S., regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include:
 

● | Establishment registration and device listing requirements, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 807; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality System Regulation requirements, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 820; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Labeling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., “off-label,” uses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 803; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 806. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

 

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions:
 

● | Issuance of Form 483 observations during a facilities inspection; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Untitled letters or warning letters; 
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Fines, injunctions and civil penalties; 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Consent Decree, which forces improvements in the quality management system through the use of the federal courts; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Recall or seizure of our products; 
--+---------------------------------------


● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Criminal prosecution. 
--+--------------------------

 
We are subject to unannounced establishment inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
 
International 
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. The European Union/European Economic Area, or EU/EEA, requires a CE conformity mark in order to market medical devices. Many other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, accept CE or FDA clearance or approval, although others, such as China, Brazil, Canada and Japan require separate regulatory filings.
 
In the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE marking of conformity to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE marking of conformity we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Based on this certification we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products.
 
Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 
We have obtained approval to sell our products in Europe, China, Canada, Israel, Russia and Mexico, and we are currently seeking approval in several other countries.

Sales and Marketing Commercial Compliance 
 
Federal anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Possible sanctions for violation of these anti-kickback laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions.
 
In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties.
 
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.
 
The U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of devices we distribute.
 
Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The Affordable Care Act also imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. Device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse 
 
Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally funded healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consultant arrangements with physicians. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers. Further, recently enacted amendments to the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amend the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid. In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal physician self-referral statute, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship, from referring Medicare patients for designated health services, which include clinical pathology services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with the Stark Law or state self-referral laws and regulations, our pathology laboratory business could be subject to severe financial consequences, including the obligation to refund amounts billed to third party payors in violation of such laws, civil penalties and potentially also exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The Stark Law often is enforced through lawsuits brought under the Federal False Claims Act, violations of which trigger significant monetary penalties and treble damages.

Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
 
Health Information Privacy 
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities and their business associates, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information.
 
We have implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For example, we could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. If we were to experience a breach of protected health information, we could be subject to significant adverse publicity in addition to possible enforcement sanctions and civil damages lawsuits. Finally, we may be required to incur additional costs related to ongoing HIPAA compliance as may be necessary to address evolving interpretations and enforcement of HIPAA and other health information privacy and security laws, the enactment of new laws or regulations, emerging cybersecurity threats and other factors.

Research and Development
 
Research and development costs relate to our products under development and quality and regulatory costs and are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development expense of approximately $6.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Most of the increase in R&D spending in 2018 was related to the development of a device for intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT) for the treatment of breast and other cancers, for which we filed a 510(k) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2017.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 48 employees, including 45 in the U.S. and three in Israel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
