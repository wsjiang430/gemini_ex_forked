Description of Business
 
Ecoark Holdings’ continuing operations focus on solutions offered by Zest Labs.
 
Zest Labs
 
Zest Labs offers freshness management solutions for fresh food growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, grocers and restaurants. Its Zest Fresh solution is a cloud-based post-harvest shelf-life and freshness management solution that improves delivered freshness of produce and protein and reduces post-harvest losses at the retailer due to temperature handling and processing by 50% or more by intelligently matching customer freshness requirements with actual product freshness. It focuses on four primary value propositions – operational efficiency, consistent food freshness, reduced waste, and improved food safety. Zest Fresh empowers workers with real-time analytic tools and alerts that improve efficiency while driving quality consistency through best practice adherence at a pallet level. Zest Labs also offers its Zest Delivery solution that provides real-time monitoring and control for prepared food delivery containers, helping delivery and dispatch personnel ensure the quality and safety of delivered food.

On June 6, 2019, Zest Labs announced a strategic collaboration between AgroFresh and Zest Labs to strengthen their end-to-end solutions. AgroFresh will incorporate Zest Labs’ Zest Fresh™ solution into its FreshCloud™ Transit Insights platform. The agreement will utilize both companies’ resources and strengths to provide customers with a comprehensive solution that improves operations, increases visibility into produce shelf-life and reduces food waste.
 
Zest Labs was previously known as Intelleflex Corporation. Effective on October 28, 2016, Intelleflex Corporation changed its name to Zest Labs, Inc. to align its corporate name with its mission and the brand name of its products and services.
 
The Zest Fresh value proposition is to reduce fresh food loss by improving quality consistency. In the U.S. produce market, it is reported that roughly 30% of post-harvest fresh food is lost or wasted and therefore not consumed. Both fresh food producers and retailers bear significant expense when harvested food is either rejected due to early spoilage or reduced in value due to early ripening. Zest Labs believes that a significant portion of this waste can be attributed to inconsistent quality or freshness based on variable post-harvest processing and handling. Fresh food producers and retailers manage food distribution and inventory based on the harvest date, with the assumption that all food harvested on the same day will have the same freshness. However, studies have shown that harvest conditions and post-harvest handling can have a significant effect on the actual remaining freshness and, if not properly accounted for, can result in food loss or spoilage ahead of expectations. Zest Fresh empowers fresh food producers and retailers to significantly reduce the post-harvest loss by providing real-time guidance to process adherence, intelligent distribution and best handling practices, with a goal of providing significant financial savings to fresh food producers and retailers. 
 
Zest Labs has developed the industry’s first freshness metric called the Zest Intelligent Pallet Routing Code (“ZIPR Code”). The ZIPR Code has three main components: Harvest Quality which sets total freshness capacity (for example, 12 days for strawberries), Handling Impact which reflects aging acceleration due to improper handling, and Future Handling which accurately reflects how the product will be handled (for example, store shelf temperature may be 40 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 34 degrees Fahrenheit). 
 
Zest Fresh is offered to fresh food producers, processors, distributors, restaurants and grocers with pricing based on the number of pallets managed by Zest Fresh, typically from the field harvest through retail grocery delivery. The Zest Fresh service includes a re-usable wireless Internet of Things (“IoT”) condition sensor that travels with the pallet of fresh food from the field or processor through retail delivery, continuously collecting product condition data. The collected pallet product data is analyzed, using artificial intelligence-based predictive analytics in real time by the Zest Fresh cloud-based solution, with the fresh food producers and retailers accessing data through Zest Fresh web and mobile applications. Zest Fresh provides workers with real-time feedback on the current handling or processing of each pallet, empowering best practice adherence to achieve maximum freshness. Zest Fresh also provides dynamic updates as to actual product freshness for each pallet, enabling intelligent routing and inventory management of each pallet in a manner that ensures optimum delivered freshness. Zest Fresh also includes integrated blockchain support to grower and shipper customers via the Zest Fresh platform. 
 
Zest Labs’ Zest Delivery solution helps to manage prepared food delivery from the restaurant through to the customer. Zest Delivery manages the delivery container environment, both monitoring and controlling the product condition. The value of Zest Delivery is to manage prepared meals in an ideal state for consumption, while accommodating extended pre-staging or delivery times. Extended pre-staging times are associated with “instant delivery” services of prepared meals, where the meals are often pre-staged in a delivery area ahead of demand. While pre-staging enables fast demand response time, it can result in prepared meals being staged for extended periods, which can potentially impact quality, value and safety. Zest Delivery monitors and controls the delivery container environment to preserve the prepared meal in ideal, ready to consume condition. Zest Delivery also provides the dispatcher with real-time remote visibility to the condition of available meals and confirming quality prior to dispatch. Zest Delivery provides automated, real-time visibility for a very distributed fleet of drivers, reflecting prepared meal food safety, quality and availability. Zest Delivery is offered to meal delivery companies based on the quantity of delivery containers and frequency of use.
 
Zest Labs currently holds rights to 67 U.S. patents (with additional patents pending), numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including Radio-Frequency Identification (“RFID”) technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest Labs has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for “Intelleflex,” the Intelleflex logo, “Zest,” “Zest Data Services,” and the Zest, Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery logos, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest Labs’ products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates.

Although most components essential to Zest Labs’ business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain RFID or other wireless custom integrated circuits, and application-specific integrated circuits are currently obtained by Zest Labs from single or limited sources, principally in Asia.
 
Zest Labs is part of a very competitive industry that markets solutions to fresh food supply chain users, such as fresh food growers, producers and retailers. Many other companies that are both more established and command much greater resources compete in this market. While Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery offer new technical approaches and new user value, it remains uncertain if Zest Labs will gain sufficient adoption of its products to make them viable in the market. Further, it is unclear what industry competitors are developing that might address similar user needs. Zest Labs’ products provide a new approach for industry participants, and as with any new approach, adoption is uncertain as many in the industry can be slow to embrace new technology and/or new approaches. These market challenges can lead to extended sales cycles that may include extended pilot testing often at Zest Labs’ expense, for which the outcome remains unclear until the completion of each test. For these reasons, and others, forecasting new business adoption and future revenue can be very difficult and volatile. However, the Company believes that Zest Fresh offers fresh food retailers, growers, shippers, processors and distributors an opportunity to differentiate their businesses in ways that the shipment of canned and boxed food products cannot, as competition in the agriculture, grocery, food service and restaurant markets continues to accelerate. 
 
The acquisition of 440labs in May 2017 allowed Zest Labs to internally maintain its software development and information solutions for cloud, mobile, and IoT applications. 440labs had been a key development partner with Zest Labs for more than four years prior to the May 2017 acquisition, contributing its expertise in scalable enterprise cloud solutions and mobile applications.
 
Discontinued Operations:
 
Pioneer Products

Pioneer Products was located in Rogers, Arkansas and was involved in the selling of recycled plastic products and other products. It sold to the world’s largest retailer.

Pioneer Products was purchased by Ecoark in 2012. Pioneer Products acquired Sable Polymer Solutions, LLC (“Sable”) in a stock transaction on May 3, 2016. Since that date, Sable’s results have been included with Pioneer Products. In May 2018 the Ecoark Holdings Board of Directors (“Board”) approved a plan to sell Pioneer and Sable. Pioneer concluded operations in February 2019, and the sale of Sable assets was completed in March 2019. Relevant assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and operations are classified as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements.

Competition

Zest Labs operates in markets for products and services that are highly competitive and face aggressive competition in all areas of their business. 
 
The market for cloud-based, real-time supply chain analytic solutions—the market in which Zest Labs competes—is rapidly evolving. There are several competitors with competing technologies, including companies that have greater resources than Ecoark Holdings, which operate in this space. Some of these companies have brand recognition, established customer relationships, and own the manufacturing process. 
 
Ecoark Holdings believes that, analyzing the competitive factors affecting the market for the solutions and services its subsidiaries provide, its products/services compete favorably by offering integrated solutions to their customers. The Company has incurred research and development expenses of $3,320 and $5,576 in the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to develop its solutions and differentiate those solutions from competitive offerings.
