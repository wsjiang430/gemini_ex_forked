Business Overview
 
We are a lifestyle company that specializes in developing premier hemp and CBD products in the functional beverage and fitness markets. Focusing on the hemp energy drink, low carb and low-calorie lemonade, and CBD water markets, we believe that we have positioned ourselves as a premium lifestyle brand.
 
We currently sell Kona, HighDrate, and Ooh La Lemin through resellers, our websites, and distributors that span across 18 states. Our products are available in a wide variety of stores, including convenience and grocery stores, smoke shops, and gift shops. Gold Leaf also distributes our own products, as well as products purchased for resale from several other beverage manufacturers. These premium beverages and snacks are available in more than 1,500 grocery stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, vape shops, and specialty stores.
 
Product Lines
 
Within our Company, we market five distinct product lines: hemp-infused energy drinks, CBD-infused energy water, low carb and low-calorie lemonade, and apparel with our trademark logo.
 
Our hemp-infused energy drink is available in both regular and sugar-free options. These energy drinks are infused with organic hemp protein powder and contain essential vitamins and ingredients that give consumers a natural energy boost. Hemp protein contains no gluten and is compatible with a variety of diets, including vegan and Kosher. Our hemp energy drinks are available in eight flavors: classic hemp, platinum hemp, sugar-free hemp, cherry vanilla, bubble gum, candy apple, cotton candy, and pink grapefruit.
 
HighDrate’s CBD-infused energy water is great tasting, sugar-free, and powered by Alkame’s patented technology, which uses its advanced water treatment to create a premium oxygenated alkaline water with natural antioxidants. Alkame believes based on a double-blind placebo, peer-backed research project that it conducted, its technology can boost the immune system and physical performance. HighDrate’s CBD-infused energy water contains 80 mg of caffeine and 10 mg of CBD. We believe that CBD aids the body’s endocannabinoid system in neuroprotection, stress recovery, immune balance, and homeostatic regulation. HighDrate’s CBD-infused energy water is available in six flavors: watermelon, kiwi strawberry, tropical coconut, Georgia peach, sour apple, and blue island punch.

We also sell branded apparel. We use only high-quality textiles and specialty inks and foils, which provide consumers with a premium fit and feel. We currently offer shirts, tanks, hats, and towels for sale. Revenues generated from sales of our apparel historically has represented approximately less than 1% of our gross annual sales.
 
Distributors and Resellers
 
Our markets include over 1,500 accounts in grocery stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, vape shops, and specialty stores located in Florida and South Carolina. In addition to distributing the Company’s own beverage products, the Company also distributes other products, including alkaline waters, beverages for kids, energy drinks, fruit flavored sodas, low-carb lemonade, healthy aloe juice drinks, and CBD-infused products, all of which complement the Company’s current product offerings.
 
We sell our products primarily to beverage distributors and resellers, retail grocery, smoke shops and specialty stores, wholesalers, merchandisers, convenience stores, and beverage services. We focus on sales to consumers in the functional beverages sector that lead an active lifestyle and need a balance that will meet their needs of providing their minds and bodies with a focused boost and quick recovery. Our beverages support consumers that lead a healthy lifestyle based on choices made about daily habits by providing products that provide a healthy alternative in their beverage choices. A healthy lifestyle can result in consumers feeling fit and energetic and can reduce their risk for disease. We believe our products help consumers stay hydrated, revitalized, aided in stamina, and allow for faster recovery. Hemp protein contains no gluten and is compatible with a variety of diets, including vegan and Kosher. The hemp seed protein contained in our energy drinks is a great protein that contains all 20 amino acids found in the human body.

We also distribute premium beverages and snacks in key markets through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold Leaf. Gold Leaf distributes our products as well as products purchased for resale from several other beverage manufacturers. The distributed products include alkaline waters, beverages for kids, energy drinks, fruit flavored sodas, low-carb lemonade, healthy aloe juice drinks, and CBD-infused jellybeans, all of which complement our current product offerings.
 
Industry Overview
 
Our distributors and resellers and consumers span across several industries, including energy drinks, hemp or CBD drinks, health and fitness, and apparel.
 
Energy Drinks
 
The energy drink industry continues grow every year with an estimated $14 billion in sales in the United States in 2021, and sales are expected to reach $53 billion globally. The energy drink by the name “Red Bull” dominated the industry in 2020, comprising approximately 25% of the energy drink market. In 2020, an energy drink by the name of “Monster,” market share was approximately 15%.
 
The introduction of “Red Bull” in 1997, and the many other energy drinks that followed in its footsteps, has helped turn the energy drink industry into significant choice of consumers in the overall beverage industry. The rise of “Red Bull” and “Monster,” which accounted for 40 percent of the energy drink sales in the United States in 2020, has resulted in the energy drink industry rivaling the coffee industry. Energy drinks have an average of 200 mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to about two cups of coffee. The liquid and dry coffee industry accounted for approximately $102.5 billion in sales in 2019, which grew from $4.1 billion dollars in 2003. Starbucks Corporation was the sales leader of the coffee industry with approximately 40% of the market share in 2018, followed by Dunkin’ Brands Inc. with 40% of the market share in 2019.
 
Hemp or CBD Drinks
 
The HIA reported that the 2018 Farm Bill poised to restore industrial hemp to nationwide legal production for the first time since World War II, offering vast opportunities for the industry and investment in a market expected to triple in four years. With the removal of hemp from federal prohibition under the CSA, the total hemp industry is expected to grow 18.4% from 2018 through 2022. Hemp Business Journal estimates that the hemp-derived CBD market will grow to a $1.3 billion market by 2022. The U.S. hemp market, which includes CBD, textiles, and hemp seed, is expected to lead the global market in 2020, representing approximately 32% of the global market. This growth is fueled by the public’s growing demand for CBD products. The 2018 Farm Bill aims the industry to accelerate and establish itself as a global hemp powerhouse led by hemp-derived CBD, and establishes legal production for CBD.
 
Health and Fitness
 
The health and fitness industry, which includes food and beverages, saw consumer awareness drive trends to health and wellness, plant-based, and clean-label products in 2022. We believe that conscious consumerism will continue to drive these trends in 2023. We believe that consumers are making food and beverage choices based on their personal definition of health. Further, we believe that consumers are looking for healthy alternatives to obtain relief from pain and anxiety, and that CBD has become a viable option because it balances the mind and body. Women have traditionally been early adapters of health and wellness trends and CBD-infused products, food, and beverages have been recognized by women to have a connection between happiness and health.
Apparel
 
The global apparel market is projected to grow to $1.5 trillion dollars in 2021, compared to $1.3 trillion in 2015. Brand names and logos for leading energy drink companies such as Monster and Rockstar can be found on men’s and women’s apparel around the world; however, the biggest apparel companies not affiliated with energy drinks control the majority of the market. Energy drink apparel is not expected to be a large contributor to the apparel industry.

Competition
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, and developing new products and flavors, as well as highly intensive promoting and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image, taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, brand exposure, and marketing, as well as pricing. We also rely on our beverage distributors to allocate more attention to our products than those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the “alternative,” energy, coffee, and “functional” beverage categories could cause our products to maintain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Our energy products have entered an already crowded market, and we aware of both our strengths and shortcomings as we compete in the energy drink market. Our energy products are part of niche industry that includes CBD, hemp seed, organic, and lifestyle, which we believe separates our energy drinks from others in the market. Within the global CBD beverage market, sales are expected to grow at a faster rate than conventional energy drinks. In 2020, the CBD beverage market was valued at $3.4 billion, and is expected to reach $14.6 billion by 2026 with a compounded annual growth rate of 27.5%. Combined with the THC-infused beverage market, the CBD Beverage Market is expected to reach $1.4 billion in the United States alone by 2025. The Alkaline Water Company, Inc. (NASDAQ and TSXV: WTER), HEXO Corp. (NYSE and TSX: HEXO), Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY), and Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE: CGC; TSX: WEED) are prominent players in the CBD beverage market.
 
We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing and sales efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers, and distributors and resellers, many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and, in many cases better financed competitors. Our energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar. We also compete with smaller companies.
 
Co-Packing
 
We do not directly produce our hemp-infused energy drinks, HighDrate CBD-infused energy waters, or Ooh La Lemin, but instead outsource the production of our products with our specifications to third-party bottlers and co-packers. We use co-packers to produce our beverage products. The co-packers are responsible for the production and packaging of the finished products, including the procurement of all required ingredients and packaging materials. We have partnered with multiple co-packers in the United States to provide fulfillment of our products from quality, low-cost sources. These partners are integral to our success, providing, we believe, the ability to scale as needed. We store all of our products, except for Ooh La Lemin, in our warehouses located in Greer, South Carolina and Melbourne, Florida. Ooh La Lemin is stored in our co-packers’ warehouse.
 
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products, are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials, including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, caps, labels, flavors, juice concentrates, coffee, tea, dietary ingredients, other ingredients, and certain sweeteners, are unable to procure adequate packing arrangements, or are unable adequately or timely to ship our products, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. That short-term supply inability may also result in a longer-term reduction in orders for our products.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The raw materials used in the production of our products are obtained by our co-packers and consist primarily of materials such as the flavors, caffeine, sugars or sucralose, taurine, vitamins, CBD, and hemp seed protein contained in our beverages, the bottles in which our beverages are packaged, and the labeling on the outside of our beverages. These principal raw materials are subject to price and availability fluctuations. We currently rely on a few key co-packers, which in turn rely on a few key suppliers. We continually endeavor to have back-up co-packers, which co-packers would in turn depend on their third-party suppliers to supply certain of the flavors and concentrates that are used in our beverages. We are also dependent on these co-packers to negotiate arrangements with their existing suppliers that would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor formulas under certain extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, our co-packers may have contractual restrictions with their suppliers or our co-packers may need to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses that may limit our co-packers’ ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers. Contractual restrictions in the agreements we have with certain distributors may also limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative distributors. We believe that a satisfactory supply of co-packers will continue to be available at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard. With respect to Gold Leaf’s operations, we continually endeavor to contract with additional beverage vendors to ensure we have adequate inventory. We believe that a satisfactory supply of vendors will continue to be available at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
Quality Control
 
All quality control is handled by our co-packers. To date, we have not had any quality issues with our products. In the future, if any quality issues were to arise, we expect that we would resolve them with the specific co-packer involved or engage a new co-packer for our products.
Distribution
 
Distribution patterns in the energy drink and water industries are such that large buying groups dictate what products are used in their channels. Working with these large buying groups could open large distribution channels that could potentially supply our product offerings in several market segments. We have distribution agreements with each distributor with which we partner that distributes our products. Our distribution agreements are for a one-year term and typically automatically renews unless the distributor or we terminate the agreement. We ship product directly from our distribution center in South Carolina, our warehouse in Florida, or directly from our co-packers to our distribution partners in the United States. Our distributors consist of state-wide tier 1 distributors and regional small-to-medium size distributors.
Business Strategy
 
We have pursued specific and definable market segments with a multi-tiered, multi-channel approach. We have leveraged our products with direct sales and a distribution strategy using established beverage distributors. We are pursuing direct-ship opportunities, such as grocery stores and convenient stores, which would allow us to ship product to one location where the direct-ship store could then self-distribute our product to its multiple retail locations. We also continue to focus on our online presence by selling our products on popular e-commerce websites, such as Amazon.com, where we ship bulk product to its warehouse and Amazon handles all product fulfillment. Finally, we operate three e-commerce websites, where we sell directly to consumers in the United States. We continue to look to online retail markets and additional established distributors for revenue growth.
Marketing Strategy
 
Our sales and marketing strategy for all of our beverage products is to focus on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product samplings. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events, where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers, and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions, and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We collaborate with external marketing companies with diverse experience in product design, innovative thinking, transparency in decision-making, brand metrics, executive management, sales, and strategic marketing. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, sports personality endorsements, sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes, teams, series, bands, esports, causes, and events. In-store posters, outdoor posters, social media (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements), and coupons may also be used to promote our brands.

We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from time to time in order to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we continue to reevaluate from time to time.
 
Promotion Strategy
 
Public relations and industry media have helped in our over-all market awareness plans. Our announcements of distribution partnerships have assisted in identifying new partners to distribute our products. We believe that announcing these partnerships in industry specific media help expand market awareness of our products. Feature articles and product reviews have also helped launch and support brand awareness. We include our products in industry specific buying guides, which has assisted in creating new relationship with distributors and retail outlets. Finally, we focus on creating products that we believe taste great and use attractive branding with our labels and other materials to catch consumers’ attention either in person at a retail store or online on a website.
Pricing Strategy
 
We strive to set the pricing of products at levels that are competitive with leaders in each respective market segment. We offer industry-standard discounts to distributors and retailers. We do not typically include quantity discounts but such discounts may be negotiated with major buying groups.
Sales Strategy
 
Our sales strategy is to exploit the low carb and low-calorie beverage market, along with the energy drink and water markets in 2023, with the groundwork that we laid out in 2021 and 2022. We believe that tradeshows will play a major role in creating market awareness of our brands. Currently, our lemonade and energy drinks are available for sale on Amazon.com, Inc.’s website, the largest internet-based retailer in the United States.

Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to protect our intellectual property through, among other things, a combination of trade secrets, know-how, and trademarks. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, to the extent possible. We have three trademarks. One is for use of “Kona Gold Hemp Energy Drinks” registered in the Company’s name. The second trademark is for the use of “HighDrate” registered in the Company’s name. The third trademark is for the use of “OOH LA LEMIN” registered in the Company’s name. We do not have any patents.

Government Regulation and Compliance
 
The production, distribution, and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the FDCA; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“California Proposition 65”); and a number of other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling, and ingredients of such products.
 
Further, the regulation of food products in the United States, including products containing CBD, is complex, multi-faceted, and currently undergoing significant change. The FDA, the FTC, the USDA, and other regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, composition, production, import, export, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, marketing, and post-market reporting of foods, including those that contain CBD. We, along with our third-party suppliers, co-packers, and third-party bottlers, are required to navigate a complex regulatory framework. The various federal, state, and local regulations regarding foods containing CBD are evolving, and we continue to monitor those developments. However, we cannot predict the timing, scope, or terms of any new or revised state, federal or local regulations relating to animal foods containing CBD.
 
Regulation of Hemp and CBD
 
Historically, the DEA regulated CBD, pursuant to the CSA, which establishes a framework of controls over certain substances, depending on whether they are classified in one of five risk-based schedules. Schedule I substances are the most stringently controlled, as they have been determined to have a high potential for abuse, there are no currently accepted medical uses in the United States, and there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the substance under medical supervision. The CSA classifies “marijuana” as a Schedule I controlled substance and previously defined “marijuana” to include all parts of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not; the seeds of the plant; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound mixture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or its resin (with a few exceptions, such as mature stalks of the plant and seeds incapable of germination). Pursuant to this definition, the DEA interpreted CBD to fall within the statutory definition of “marijuana” as a compound or derivative of the cannabis plant.
 
In February 2014, Congress enacted the 2014 Farm Bill to allow for the limited growth and cultivation of industrial hemp, which was defined as including all parts of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. This statute also allowed, as permitted by state law, the growing and cultivating of industrial hemp under the auspices of a state agricultural pilot program and by institutions of higher education and state departments of agriculture.
 
In December 2018, Congress enacted the 2018 Farm Bill to allow more broadly for the production of hemp pursuant to state and tribal plans overseen by the USDA. The 2018 Farm Bill amended the statutory definition of “marijuana” under the CSA specifically to exclude “hemp”, which is defined as any part of the cannabis plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Under this definition, as long as CBD meets the statutory definition of “hemp,” then it is no longer a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. However, the 2018 Farm Bill did not modify the FDCA and specifically preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, such as CBD, pursuant to the FDCA.
 
Under the 2018 Farm Bill framework, states and Native American tribes may submit to the USDA, through the relevant state department of agriculture, a plan under which the state or Native American tribe will monitor and regulate the production of industrial hemp. For those states that do not have an approved state plan, the production of hemp will be subject to a USDA established plan, although states retain the ability to prohibit hemp production within their borders. On October 31, 2019, the USDA issued the IFR to implement the 2018 Farm Bill, which established the required regulatory framework governing commercial hemp production in the United States. The USDA has begun reviewing hemp production plans submitted by state and tribal governments, although several states have informed the USDA that they will continue to operate under their 2014 Farm Bill pilot programs for the time being. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill will remain effective until October 31, 2020 (one year after the date of publication of the IFR). In addition, no state or Native American tribe may prohibit the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products produced in accordance with the 2018 Farm Bill through the state or territory, as applicable. The USDA has interpreted this provision also to apply to interstate transportation of hemp that complies with the 2014 Farm Bill through October 31, 2020. Effective March 22, 2021, The USDA issued the final rule, which creates the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program. The program provides requirements for maintaining records about the land where hemp is produced, testing the levels of total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, disposing of non-compliant plants, licensing hemp producers, and ensuring compliance under the new program. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has been delegated authority to administer the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program.

FDA Regulation of Foods
 
The FDA regulates foods under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDCA defines “food” as articles used for food or drink for people or animals, which includes products that are intended primarily for nutritional use, taste, or aroma and the components of such products. The FDA also imposes certain requirements on foods relating to their composition, production, labeling, and marketing. Among other items, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are produced must register with the FDA, comply with cGMPs and comply with a range of food safety requirements.
 
Although foods are not required to obtain premarket approval from the FDA, any substance that is added to or is expected to become a component of food must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation, unless it is generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”) under the conditions of its intended use. A food may be adulterated if it uses an ingredient that is neither GRAS nor an approved food additive, and that food may not be legally marketed in the United States. The FDA has confirmed that the use of cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds in food products is subject to these food additive requirements. At this time, there are no approved food additive petitions or regulations for any cannabis-derived food additive and, while the FDA has issued a “no questions” response to certain GRAS notifications for hemp seed products, these GRAS determinations do not encompass hemp and CBD products more generally.
 
Additionally, the FDCA prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that contains an approved drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public (unless certain exceptions apply). Under this prohibition, the FDA has stated that foods that contain CBD are adulterated because CBD is an active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug that was the subject of substantial clinical investigations before it was marketed as a food, and that none of the exceptions applies.
 
Although the FDA has stated that it interprets the FDCA to prohibit the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food into which CBD has been added and has taken enforcement action against marketers of certain CBD products (some in collaboration with the FTC), the FDA is in the process of evaluating its regulatory approach to products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The FDA has formed an internal working group to evaluate the issue and on May 31, 2019 held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, producing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. The hearing featured extensive discussion from a variety of stakeholders regarding the use of hemp and CBD in FDA-regulated products, including foods. At the hearing, FDA stated that, while it does not have a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to any CBD products, the agency’s biggest concern is the marketing of products that puts the health and safety of consumers at risk, such as those claiming to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, or cure serious diseases in the absence of requisite drug approvals.
 
Further, on March 5, 2020, the FDA issued a report to Congress that was required under the 2018 Farm Bill in which the agency announced that it is currently evaluating a risk-based enforcement policy for CBD to provide more clarity to the industry and the public while the agency takes potential steps to establish a clear regulatory pathway. Although it is unclear whether or when the FDA will ultimately issue such an enforcement policy, the agency reemphasized that it will continue to take action against unlawful CBD products that pose a risk of harm to the public, including products with therapeutic claims; products that include contaminants such as heavy metals, THC, and other harmful substances; products associated with false statements, such as omitted ingredients and incorrect statements about the amount of CBD; and products marketed to vulnerable populations, such as infants and children.
 
The labeling of foods is regulated by both the FDA and state regulatory authorities. FDA regulations require proper identification of the product, a net quantity statement, a statement of the name and place of business of the producer or distributor, and proper listing of all of the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. The FDA may classify some of our products differently than we do and may impose more stringent regulations, which could lead to possible enforcement action.

Under the FDCA, the FDA may require the recall of a food product if there is a reasonable probability that the product is adulterated or misbranded, and the use of or exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, food producers may voluntarily recall or withdraw their products from the market. If the FDA believes that our products are adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise marketed in violation of the FDCA, the agency may take further enforcement action, including:
 

● | restrictions on the production or marketing of a product; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | required modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective marketing information; 
● | issuance of safety alerts, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about a product; 
● | warning or untitled letters; 
● | product seizure or detention; 
● | refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
● | fines, injunctions, or consent decrees; and 
● | imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
Legislation may be introduced in the United States at the federal, state, and municipal level in respect of each of the subject areas. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages.
 
The FDA revised regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products, including requirements to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. In December 2018, the USDA promulgated regulations requiring that, by January 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods must include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. We may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with these and other new regulations. Additionally, these new regulations may impact, reduce, or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.
 
Proposals to limit or restrict the sale and/or advertising of energy drinks to minors or persons below a specified age, to restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold, or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised or enacted in certain states, counties, and municipalities throughout the United States. Any such limitations or restrictions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 
We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed, and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance will have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income, or competitive position. We believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.

Insurance
 
Our products are subject to risks. While we have planned for these contingencies and have purchased insurance to address potential liabilities associated with product production, there can be no assurance that all potential liabilities will be covered by insurance or that the insurance coverage will be adequate.
Employees
 
We believe the people who work for us are critical to our continued success. As of March 27, 2023, we employed a total of 21 persons, all of whom were employed on a full-time basis. We strive to attract and retain qualified personnel; however, due to the size and scope of our business, we do not have any formal human capital strategies.
