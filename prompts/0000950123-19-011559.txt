ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The Company
 Oshkosh Corporation is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of access equipment, specialty vehicles and truck bodies for the primary markets of access equipment, defense, fire & emergency and municipal, refuse hauling, concrete placement as well as airport services. Oshkosh engineers vehicles and equipment that move industries forward. Each of our products and technologies is designed with customers and users in mind, from the four-wheel drive system that we patented in 1917 to advances in mobility systems, electrification, active safety, autonomous vehicles and telematics.
 The Company comprises 11 brands and maintains four reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: access equipment, defense, fire & emergency and commercial, which comprised 49%, 24%, 15% and 12%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. Oshkosh’s leading brands include a wide range of products to serve a diverse group of industries. This allows the Company to leverage innovations and efficiencies across the enterprise, including supply chain, materials integration, manufacturing processes, facilities and cross portfolio innovation creating a company that is a truly different integrated global industrial.
 The Company made approximately 24%, 22% and 20% of its net sales for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, to the U.S. government, a substantial majority of which were under multi-year contracts and programs in the defense vehicle market. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to the Company’s business segments.
 JLG, a global designer and manufacturer of aerial work platforms and telehandlers used in a wide variety of construction, industrial, institutional and general maintenance applications to position workers and materials at elevated heights, forms the foundation of the Company’s access equipment segment. JLG’s customer base includes equipment rental companies, construction contractors, manufacturing companies and home improvement centers. The access equipment segment also includes Jerr-Dan-branded tow trucks (wreckers) and roll-back vehicle carriers (carriers) sold to towing companies.
 The Company’s defense segment has designed, manufactured and sold military tactical wheeled vehicles to the DoD for more than 90 years.

Mr. Jones is complemented by an experienced senior management team that has been assembled through internal promotions and external hires. The management team has successfully executed a strategic reshaping and expansion of the Company’s business, which has positioned the Company to be a global leader in the specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets and transformed the Company into a different integrated global industrial.
Business Strategy
 The Company is focused on increasing its net sales, profitability and cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet by capitalizing on its competitive strengths and pursuing an integrated business strategy. The Company completed a comprehensive strategic planning process in fiscal 2011 with the assistance of a globally-recognized consulting firm that culminated in the creation of the Company’s roadmap, named MOVE, to deliver outstanding long-term shareholder value. The Company has subsequently updated and refreshed the MOVE strategy, which it expects to continue executing in fiscal 2020 and beyond.
 2




The MOVE strategy consists of the following four key initiatives:
 Market Leader Delighting Customers. This initiative focuses on growing profitability by maintaining intense focus on customer experience. By tapping into the voice of the customer, the Company aims to deliver superior products and services under this initiative. The Company drives consistent customer experience through the use of standard processes and tools throughout the organization. The Company believes its focus on People First Initiatives results in more engaged and energized team members focused on delivery experiences that exceed customer expectations. Customers derive value by working with a partner that provides total customer care throughout the product life cycle. The Company’s goal is to delight its customers.
 Optimize Cost and Capital Structure. This initiative focuses on optimizing the Company’s cost and capital structure to provide value for customers and shareholders by aggressively attacking its product, process and overhead costs and opportunistically using its expected free cash flow to return capital to shareholders or invest in acquisition opportunities. The Company utilizes a comprehensive lean enterprise focus to drive to be a low-cost producer in all of its product lines while sustaining premium product features and quality and to deliver low product life cycle costs for its customers. Lean is a methodology used to eliminate non-value-added work from a process stream. The Company also embraces organizational simplification by focusing on what drives value to customers and objectively allocating time and resources in these areas. As a result of its focus on cost optimization, the Company expects to more efficiently utilize its manufacturing facilities, increase inventory turns, reduce product, process and overhead costs, lower manufacturing lead times and new product development cycle times and increase its operating income margins.
 Value Innovation. This initiative focuses on emphasizing the Company’s new product development as it seeks to expand sales and margins by leading its core markets in the introduction of new or improved products and technologies. The Company primarily uses internal development but also uses licensing of technology, other partnering arrangements and strategic acquisitions to execute multi-generational product plans in each of the Company’s businesses. The Company actively seeks to commercialize emerging technologies that are capable of expanding customer uses of its products. The Company also strives to provide value to its customers by offering best in class aftermarket services and support.
 Emerging Market Expansion. This initiative focuses on the Company’s continued expansion into those specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets globally where it has acquired or can acquire strong market positions over time and where it believes it can leverage synergies in purchasing, manufacturing, technology and distribution to increase sales and profitability. Business development teams actively pursue new customers in targeted developing countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. In pursuit of this strategy, the Company has sales and service offices in Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, China, South Korea and Japan to pursue various opportunities in each of those countries. In addition, the Company continues to expand its sales and aftermarket footprint in multiple countries in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. The Company would also consider selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions to enhance the Company’s product offerings and expand its international presence in the specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets.

Marketing, Sales, Distribution and Service
 The Company believes it differentiates itself from many of its competitors by tailoring its distribution to the needs of its specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets and with its national and global sales and service capabilities. Distribution personnel demonstrate to customers how to use the Company’s products properly. In addition, the Company’s flexible distribution is focused on meeting customers on their terms, whether on a job site, in an evening public meeting or at a municipality’s office, compared to the showroom sales approach of the typical dealer of large vehicle manufacturers. The Company backs all products with same-day parts shipment, and its service technicians are available in person or by telephone to domestic customers 365 days a year. The Company believes its dedication to keeping its products in-service in demanding conditions worldwide has contributed to customer loyalty.
 The Company provides its salespeople, representatives and distributors with product and sales training on the operation and specifications of its products. The Company’s engineers, along with its product managers, develop operating manuals and provide field support at vehicle delivery.
 U.S. dealers and representatives enter into agreements with the Company that allow for termination by either party generally upon 90 days’ notice, subject to applicable laws. Dealers and representatives, except for those utilized by JLG and IMT, are generally not permitted to market and sell competitive products.
 Access equipment segment. JLG’s products are marketed across six continents through independent rental companies and distributors that purchase JLG products and then rent or sell them and provide service support, as well as through other Company owned sales and service branches. JLG maintains a broad worldwide internal sales force. Sales employees are dedicated to specific major customers, channels or geographic regions. JLG’s international sales employees are spread among international sales and service offices throughout the world.
 The Company markets its Jerr-Dan-branded carriers and wreckers through its extensive network of independent distributors.
 Defense segment. Oshkosh Defense sells substantially all of its domestic defense products directly to principal branches of the DoD and has sold its defense products to numerous international militaries around the globe. Oshkosh Defense maintains a liaison office in Washington, D.C. to represent its interests with the U.S. Congress, the offices of the Executive Branch of the U.S. government, the Pentagon, as well as international embassies and government agencies. Oshkosh Defense locates its business development, consultants and engineering professionals near its customers’ principal commands, both domestically and internationally. Oshkosh Defense sells and services defense products to approved international governments as Direct Commercial Sales or Foreign Military Sales via U.S. government channels. Oshkosh Defense supports international sales through international sales offices, as well as through dealers, distributors and representatives.
 In addition to marketing its current tactical wheeled vehicle offerings and competing for new contracts, Oshkosh Defense actively works with the U.S. Armed Services to develop new applications for its vehicles and expand its services.
 Logistics services are increasingly important in the defense market. The Company believes that its proven worldwide logistics capabilities and internet-based ordering, invoicing and electronic payment systems have significantly contributed to the expansion of its defense parts and service business. Oshkosh Defense maintains a large parts distribution warehouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to fulfill stringent parts delivery schedule requirements, as well as satellite facilities near DoD bases in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
 Fire & emergency segment. The Company believes the geographic breadth, size and quality of its Pierce fire apparatus sales and service organization are competitive advantages in a market characterized by a few large manufacturers and numerous small, regional competitors. Pierce’s fire apparatus are sold through an extensive network of independent sales and service organizations with hundreds of sales representatives in the U.S. and Canada, which combine broad geographical reach with high frequency of contact with fire departments and municipal government officials. These sales and service organizations are supported by product and marketing support professionals and contract administrators at Pierce. The Company believes high frequency of contact and local presence are important to cultivate major, and typically infrequent, purchases involving the city or town council, fire department, purchasing, finance and mayoral offices, among others, that may participate in a fire apparatus bid and selection process. After the sale, Pierce’s nationwide local parts and service capability is available to help municipalities maintain peak readiness for this vital municipal service.

Pierce also sells directly to the DoD and other U.S. government agencies. Many of the Pierce fire apparatus sold to the DoD are placed in service at U.S. military bases, camps and stations overseas. Additionally, Pierce sells fire apparatus to international municipal and industrial fire departments through a network of international dealers.
 The Company markets its Frontline-branded broadcast vehicles through sales representatives and its Frontline-branded command vehicles through both sales representatives and dealer organizations that are directed at government and commercial customers.
 The Company markets its Oshkosh-branded ARFF vehicles through a combination of direct sales representatives domestically and an extensive network of representatives and distributors in international markets. Certain of these international representatives and distributors also handle Pierce products. The Company’s snow removal business uses a combination of internal sales and service representatives and distributor locations to focus on the sale of snow removal vehicles, principally to airports, but also to municipalities, counties and other governmental entities in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, the Company maintains offices in Dubai, UAE; Beijing, China; Tonneins, France; and Singapore to support airport product vehicle sales and aftermarket sales and support in Europe, the Middle East, China and Southeast Asia.
 Commercial segment. The Company utilizes an extensive network of representatives and dealers supported by hundreds of internal and external sales and service representatives in North America to sell and service refuse collection vehicles, rear- and front-discharge concrete mixers and concrete batch plants. The Company also performs sales and service activities at the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Service centers located throughout the U.S. provide sales, service and parts distribution to customers in their geographic regions. The Company also uses independent sales and service organizations to market its CON-E-CO branded concrete batch plants. The Company believes this network represents one of the largest concrete mixer, concrete batch plant and refuse collection vehicle distribution networks in the U.S. 
 The Company believes its network of representatives and dealers is a competitive advantage in concrete mixer and refuse collection vehicle markets, particularly in the U.S. waste services industry where principal competitors distribute through dealers and to a lesser extent in the ready mix concrete industry, where several competitors in part use dealers. The Company believes its distribution model allows for a more tailored distribution approach in the U.S. concrete mixer and refuse collection vehicle markets, whereas dealers frequently offer a very broad and mixed product line, and accordingly, the time dealers tend to devote to concrete mixer and refuse collection vehicle sales activities is limited.
 The Company has also established an extensive network of representatives and dealers throughout the Americas for the sale of Oshkosh-, McNeilus-, CON‑E‑CO- and London-branded concrete mixers, concrete batch plants and refuse collection vehicles to international customers. The Company coordinates among its various businesses to respond to large international sales tenders with its most appropriate product offering for the tender.
 IMT distributes its products through a wide network of dealers in over one hundred locations worldwide. International dealers are primarily located in Central and South America, Australia and Asia and are primarily focused on mining and construction markets.
 Manufacturing
 The Company manufactures its products at 30 manufacturing facilities. To reduce production costs, the Company maintains a continuing emphasis on the development of proprietary components, self-sufficiency in fabrication, just-in-time inventory management, improvement in production flows and interchangeability of components among product lines, creation of jigs and fixtures to ensure repeatability of quality processes, utilization of robotics, and performance measurement to assure progress toward cost reduction targets. The Company encourages employee involvement to improve production processes and product quality.

The Company uses a common Quality Management System globally to support the delivery of consistent, high quality products and services to customers. The Company educates and trains all employees at its facilities in quality principles. The Company requires employees at all levels to understand customer and supplier requirements, measure performance, develop systems and procedures to prevent nonconformance with requirements and continually improve all work processes. The Company utilizes quality gates in its manufacturing facilities to identify quality issues early in the process and to analyze root cause at the source, resulting in improved quality, fewer defects and less rework. The Company’s Quality Management System is based on ISO 9001, a set of internationally-accepted quality system requirements established by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 9001 certification indicates that a company has established and follows a rigorous set of requirements aimed at achieving customer satisfaction by following the process approach to identify process inputs, outputs, customers, critical processes and key performance indicators, and by continually improving these processes and sharing successful practices across the organization. The following brands are ISO 9001 certified: JLG, Oshkosh Defense, Pierce, McNeilus, Frontline, Jerr-Dan and Airport Products.
 The Company has a team of employees dedicated to leading the implementation of the Oshkosh Continuous Improvement Management System (CIMS). The team is comprised of members with diverse backgrounds in quality, lean, finance, product and process engineering, and culture change management. CIMS includes lean tools to eliminate waste and to provide better value for customers. CIMS also guides customer satisfaction assessment and helps to identify opportunities to improve the customer experience with Oshkosh. CIMS supports the execution of the Company’s MOVE strategy, delivering value to both customers and shareholders. Within the Company’s facilities, CIMS improvement projects have contributed to manufacturing efficiency gains, materials management improvements, steady quality improvements and reduction of lead times. CIMS improvement projects have also freed up manufacturing space, allowing the Company to pursue a program focused on increased vertical integration, further setting the Company apart as a different integrated global industrial.
 Engineering, Research and Development
 The Company believes its extensive engineering, research and development capabilities have been key drivers of the Company’s marketplace success. The Company maintains multiple facilities for new product development and testing with a staff of approximately 1,200 engineers and technicians who are dedicated to improving existing products, development and testing of new vehicles, vehicle bodies and components and sustaining its production activities. The Company prepares multi-year new product development plans for each of its markets and measures progress against those plans each month.
 Virtually all of the Company’s sales of fire apparatus and broadcast vehicles require some level of custom engineering to meet the customer’s specifications and changing industry standards. Engineering is also a critical factor in defense vehicle markets due to the severe operating conditions under which the Company’s vehicles are utilized, new customer requirements and stringent government documentation requirements. In the access equipment and commercial segments, product innovation is highly important to meet customers’ changing requirements. Accordingly, in addition to new product development engineers and technicians, the Company maintains an additional permanent staff of engineers and engineering technicians to sustain its production activities.
 Competition
 In all of the Company’s segments, competitors include smaller, specialized manufacturers as well as large, mass producers. The Company believes that, in its specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets, it has been able to effectively compete against large, mass producers due to its product quality, manufacturing flexibility, vertical integration, purchasing power in specialty vehicle components and tailored distribution systems. In addition, the Company believes it has competitive advantages over smaller vehicle and vehicle body manufacturers due to its relatively higher volumes of similar products that permit the use of moving assembly lines and which allow it to leverage purchasing power and technology opportunities across product lines. The Company believes that its competitive cost structure, strategic global purchasing capabilities, engineering expertise, product quality and global distribution and service systems have enabled it to compete effectively.
 Certain of the Company’s competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and governmental affairs resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company’s products will continue to compete effectively with the products of competitors or that the Company will be able to retain its customer base or improve or maintain its profit margins on sales to its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act requires competition for defense programs in certain circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps will conduct competitions for programs for which the Company currently has contracts upon the expiration of the existing contracts. Competition for these and other domestic programs could result in future contracts being awarded based upon different competitive factors than those described above and would primarily include price, production capability and past performance. The U.S. government has become more aggressive in seeking to acquire the design rights to the Company’s current and potential future programs to facilitate competition for manufacturing our vehicles. The willingness of the bidders to license their design rights to the DoD was an evaluation factor in the JLTV and FMTV A2 contract competitions. Certain of the Company’s contracts with the DoD, including the JLTV and FMTV A2 contracts, require that the Company effectively transfer the “technical know-how” necessary to produce and support the vehicles and/or other deliverables within the contract to the customer.
 The Competition in Contracting Act requires competition for U.S. defense programs in most circumstances. Competition for DoD programs that the Company currently has could result in the U.S. government awarding future contracts to another manufacturer or the U.S. government awarding the contracts to the Company at lower prices and operating margins than the Company experiences under current contracts.

 Customers and Backlog
 Sales to the U.S. government comprised approximately 24% of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2019. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales for this period. A substantial majority of the Company’s net sales are derived from the fulfillment of customer orders that are received prior to commencing production.

The Company’s backlog as of September 30, 2019 decreased 0.7% to $4.14 billion compared to $4.17 billion at September 30, 2018. Access equipment segment backlog decreased 59.5% to $390.1 million at September 30, 2019 compared to $962.4 million at September 30, 2018 due to a moderation of customer demand in North America and Europe and the timing of orders as customers have become more cautious in their ordering resulting in a shift in order patterns away from placing large annual orders in advance to placing more frequent orders closer to when the equipment is needed. Defense segment backlog increased 34.0% to $2.49 billion at September 30, 2019 compared to $1.86 billion at September 30, 2018 primarily due to a $1.7 billion order for approximately 6,100 JLTVs and kits received from the U.S. Army during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, offset in part by shipments on all contracts during fiscal 2019. Fire & emergency segment backlog decreased 0.8% to $970.1 million at September 30, 2019 compared to $978.1 million at September 30, 2018. Commercial segment backlog decreased 21.1% to $296.7 million at September 30, 2019 compared to $376.0 million at September 30, 2018. Unit backlog for concrete mixers as of September 30, 2019 was down 36.4% due to lower market demand and timing of fleet orders. Unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles as of September 30, 2019 was down 18.2% compared to September 30, 2018 due to a large customer order that occurred late in fiscal 2018 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2019.
 Reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed. Backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales. Approximately 11% of the Company’s September 30, 2019 backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal 2020.
 Government Contracts
 Approximately 24% of the Company’s net sales for fiscal 2019 were made to the U.S. government, a substantial majority of which were under multi-year contracts and programs in the defense vehicle market. Accordingly, a significant portion of the Company’s sales are subject to risks specific to doing business with the U.S. government, including uncertainty of economic conditions, changes in government policies and requirements that may reflect rapidly changing military and political developments, the availability of funds and the ability to meet specified performance thresholds. Multi-year contracts may be conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations and are being impacted by the uncertainty regarding the federal budget pressures. Variances between anticipated budget and congressional appropriations may result in a delay, reduction or termination of these contracts. 
 Oshkosh Defense’s sales are substantially dependent upon periodic awards of new contracts, the purchase of base vehicle quantities and the exercise of options under existing contracts. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation process. In years when the U.S. government has not completed its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, government operations are typically funded pursuant to a “continuing resolution,” which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement of the products, services and solutions that Oshkosh Defense provides and may result in new initiatives being delayed or canceled, or funds could be reprogrammed away from Oshkosh Defense’s programs to pay for higher priority operational needs. In years when the U.S. government fails to complete its budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution, a federal government shutdown may result. This could in turn result in the delay or cancellation of key programs, which could have a negative effect on the Company’s cash flows and adversely affect the Company’s future results. In addition, payments to contractors for services performed during a federal government shutdown may be delayed, which would have a negative effect on the Company’s cash flows.
 Defense contract awards that Oshkosh Defense receives may be subject to protests by competing bidders. These protests, if successful, could result in the DoD revoking part or all of any defense contract it awards to Oshkosh Defense and an inability of Oshkosh Defense to recover amounts it has expended during the protest period in anticipation of initiating work under any such contract.
 Under firm, fixed-price contracts with the U.S. government, the price paid to the Company is generally not subject to adjustment to reflect the Company’s actual costs, except costs incurred as a result of contract changes ordered by the U.S. government. The Company generally attempts to negotiate with the U.S. government the amount of increased compensation to which the Company is entitled for government-ordered changes that result in higher costs. If the Company is unable to negotiate a satisfactory agreement to provide such increased compensation, then the Company may file an appeal with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or the U.S. Claims Court. The Company has no such appeals pending. The Company seeks to mitigate risks with respect to fixed-price contracts by executing firm, fixed-price contracts with its suppliers of significant components for the duration of the Company’s contracts.

U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or part, at the government’s convenience. If the U.S. government exercises its rights under this clause the contractor is entitled to payment for the allowable costs incurred and a reasonable profit on the work performed to date. The U.S. government can also terminate a contract for default. If a contract is terminated for default, the contractor is generally entitled to payment for work that has been accepted by the U.S. government. Termination for default may expose the Company to loss on work not yet accepted by the government and have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to obtain future orders and contracts. The U.S. government’s right to terminate its contracts has not had a material effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company.
 The Company, as a U.S. government contractor, is subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government relating to the performance of, and the accounting and general practices relating to, U.S. government contracts. Like most large government contractors, the Company is audited and reviewed by the government on a continual basis. Costs and prices under such contracts may be subject to adjustment based upon the results of such audits and reviews. Additionally, such audits and reviews can lead to civil, criminal or administrative proceedings. Such proceedings could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company or one or more of its subsidiaries can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges based on the results of such proceedings. The Company believes that the outcome of all such audits and reviews that are now pending will not have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 Suppliers
 The Company is dependent on its suppliers and subcontractors to meet commitments to its customers, and many components are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies. Components for the Company’s products are generally available from a number of suppliers, although the transition to a new supplier may require several months to conclude. The Company purchases chassis components, such as vehicle frames, engines, transmissions, radiators, axles, tires, drive motors, bearings and hydraulic components and vehicle body options, such as cranes, cargo bodies and trailers, from third-party suppliers. These body options may be manufactured specific to the Company’s requirements; however, most of the body options could be manufactured by other suppliers or the Company itself. Through reliance on this supply network for the purchase of certain components, the Company is able to reduce many of the pre-production and fixed costs associated with the manufacture of these components and vehicle body options. The Company purchases a large amount of fabrications and outsources certain manufacturing services, each generally from small companies located near its facilities. While providing low-cost services and product surge capability, such companies often require additional management attention during difficult economic conditions or contract start-up. The Company also purchases complete vehicle chassis from truck chassis suppliers in its commercial segment and, to a lesser extent, in its fire & emergency and access equipment segments. Increasingly, the Company is sourcing components globally, which may involve additional inventory requirements and introduces additional foreign currency exposures. The Company maintains an extensive qualification, on-site inspection, assistance and performance measurement system to attempt to control risks associated with reliance on suppliers. The Company occasionally experiences problems with supplier and subcontractor performance and component, chassis and body availability and must identify alternate sources of supply and/or address related warranty claims from customers.
 While the Company purchases many costly components such as chassis, engines and transmissions, it manufactures certain proprietary components and systems. These components include front drive steer axles, transfer cases, transaxles, cabs, the TAK-4 independent suspension system, Hercules and Husky compressed air foam systems, the Command Zone vehicle control system, body structures and many smaller parts that add uniqueness and value to the Company’s products. The Company believes controlling the production of these components provides a significant competitive advantage and also serves to reduce the production costs of the Company’s products. The Company intends to continue to pursue vertical integration opportunities to further increase its competitive advantages.

Intellectual Property
 Patents and licenses are important in the operation of the Company’s business. One of management’s objectives is developing proprietary components to provide the Company’s customers with advanced technological solutions at attractive prices. The Company holds in excess of 900 active domestic and foreign patents. The Company believes patents for the TAK-4 independent suspension system, which expire between 2019 and 2040, provide the Company with a competitive advantage in the defense and fire & emergency segments. In the defense segment, the TAK-4 independent suspension system has been incorporated into the U.S. Marine Corps’ MTVR and LVSR programs, the U.S. Army’s PLS A1 program, the MRAP - Joint Program Office M-ATV program, the JLTV program and the FMTV A2 program. The Company believes the TAK-4 independent suspension system provided a performance and cost advantage that contributed to the Company winning these programs. In the fire & emergency segment, TAK-4 independent suspension systems are standard on all Pierce custom fire trucks, as well as Striker and Global Striker ARFF vehicles, which the Company believes brings a similar competitive advantage to these markets.
 The Company believes that patents for certain components of its ProPulse hybrid electric drive system and Command Zone electronics system offer potential competitive advantages to product lines across all its segments. To a lesser extent, other proprietary components provide the Company a competitive advantage in each of the Company’s segments.
 As part of the Company’s long-term alliance with Caterpillar Inc., the Company acquired a non-exclusive, non-transferable worldwide license to use certain Caterpillar Inc. intellectual property through 2025 in connection with the design and manufacture of Caterpillar Inc.’s current telehandler products. Additionally, Caterpillar Inc. assigned to JLG certain patents and patent applications relating to the Caterpillar-branded telehandler products.
 The Company holds trademarks for “Oshkosh,” “Oshkosh Defense,” “TAK-4,” “ProPulse,” “JLG,” “SkyTrak,” “Pierce,” “McNeilus,” “Jerr-Dan,” “CON-E-CO,” “London” and “IMT” among others. These trademarks are considered to be important to the future success of the Company’s business.
 Employees
 As of September 30, 2019, the Company had approximately 15,400 employees. The United Auto Workers union (UAW) represented approximately 2,000 production employees at the Company’s Oshkosh, Wisconsin facilities; the Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, Blacksmiths and Forgers Union (Boilermakers) represented approximately 240 employees at the Company’s Kewaunee, Wisconsin facility; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union (Teamsters) represented approximately 220 employees at the Company’s Garner, Iowa facility. The Company’s agreement with the UAW expires in September 2021. The Company’s five-year agreement with the Boilermakers expires in May 2022. The Company’s three-year agreement with the Teamsters extends through October 2020. In addition, the majority of the Company’s approximately 1,400 employees located outside of the U.S. are represented by separate works councils or unions. The Company has adopted a people first culture to build meaningful relationships with its employees and believes its relationship with its employee team members is satisfactory.
Seasonal Nature of Business
 In the Company’s access equipment and commercial segments, business tends to be seasonal with an increase in sales occurring in the spring and summer months that constitute the traditional construction season in the northern hemisphere. In addition, sales are generally lower in the first fiscal quarter in all segments due to the relatively high number of holidays in the United States which reduce available shipping days.
