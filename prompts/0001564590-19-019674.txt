Item 1.    Business
Overview
 Regional Health Properties, Inc. (“Regional Health” or “Regional”), through its subsidiaries (together, the “Company” or “we”), is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for long-term care and senior living.  Our business primarily consists of leasing and subleasing such facilities to third-party tenants, which operate the facilities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned, leased, or managed for third parties 30 facilities primarily in the Southeast (which number was reduced to 28 effective January 15, 2019, due to a lease termination and as of April 15, 2019, four owned facilities are held for sale subject to the purchase and sale agreement). The Company’s facilities provide a range of healthcare and related services to patients and residents, including skilled nursing and assisted living services, social services, various therapy services, and other rehabilitative and healthcare services for both long-term and short-stay patients and residents.
 Regional Health’s predecessor was incorporated in Ohio on August 14, 1991, under the name Passport Retirement, Inc. In 1995, Passport Retirement, Inc. acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of AdCare Health Systems, Inc. and changed its name to AdCare Health Systems, Inc. (“AdCare”). AdCare completed its initial public offering in November 2006, relocated its executive offices and accounting operations to Georgia in 2012, and changed its state of incorporation from Ohio to Georgia in December, 2013. 
 Historically, AdCare’s business was focused primarily on owning and operating skilled nursing facilities and managing such facilities for unaffiliated owners with whom AdCare had management contracts. In July 2014, AdCare commenced a transition (the “Transition”). Whereby AdCare and its subsidiaries: (i) leased to third-party operators all of the healthcare properties which they own and previously operated; (ii) subleased to third-party operators all of the healthcare properties which they lease (but do not own) and previously operated; and (iii) retained a management agreement to manage two skilled nursing facilities and one independent living facility for third parties. The Transition was completed in December 2015, and, as a result of the Transition, the company acquired certain characteristics of a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and became focused on the ownership, acquisition and leasing of healthcare properties.
 On September 29, 2017, AdCare merged (the “Merger”) with and into Regional Health, a Georgia corporation and a then wholly owned subsidiary of AdCare formed for the purposes of the Merger, with Regional Health continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger.
 As a consequence of the Merger:
  
• | the outstanding shares of AdCare’s common stock, no par value per share (the “AdCare common stock”), converted, on a one-for-one basis, into the same number of shares of Regional Health’s common stock, no par value per share (the “RHE common stock”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the outstanding shares of AdCare’s 10.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “AdCare Series A Preferred Stock”) converted, on a one-for-one basis, into the same number of shares of Regional Health’s 10.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “RHE Series A Preferred Stock”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the board of directors (the “AdCare Board”) and executive officers of AdCare immediately prior to the Merger are the board of directors (the “RHE Board”) and executive officers, respectively, of Regional Health immediately following the Merger, and each director and executive officer continued his directorship or employment, as the case may be, with Regional Health under the same terms as his directorship or employment with AdCare immediately following the Merger;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regional Health assumed all of AdCare’s equity incentive compensation plans, and all rights to acquire shares of AdCare common stock under any AdCare equity incentive compensation plan converted into rights to acquire RHE common stock pursuant to the terms of the equity incentive compensation plans and other related documents, if any;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Regional Health became the successor issuer to AdCare and succeeded to the assets and continued the business and assumed the obligations of AdCare;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the RHE common stock and RHE Series A Preferred Stock commenced trading on the NYSE American LLC (the “NYSE American” or the “Exchange”) immediately following the Merger;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the rights of the holders of RHE common stock and RHE Series A Preferred Stock are governed by the amended and restated articles of incorporation of RHE (the “RHE Charter”) and the amended and restated bylaws of RHE (the “RHE Bylaws”). The RHE Charter is substantially equivalent to AdCare’s articles of incorporation, as amended (the “AdCare Charter”), except that the RHE Charter includes ownership and transfer restrictions related to the RHE common stock. The RHE Bylaws are substantially equivalent to the bylaws of AdCare, as amended (the “AdCare Bylaws”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there was no change in the assets we hold or in the business we conduct; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there was no fundamental change to our current operational strategy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of the Merger, the RHE Charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions with respect to the common stock. These ownership and transfer restrictions will better position the Company to comply with certain U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) to the extent such rules relate to the common stock. The RHE Board continues to analyze and consider: (i) whether and, if so, when, the Company could satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT under the Code; (ii) the structural and operational complexities which would need to be addressed before the Company could qualify as a REIT, including the disposition of certain assets or the termination of certain operations which may not be REIT compliant; and (iii) if the Company were to qualify as a REIT, whether electing REIT status would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders in light of various factors, including our significant consolidated federal net operating loss carryforwards. There is no assurance that the Company will qualify as a REIT in future taxable years or, if it were to so qualify, that the RHE Board would determine that electing REIT status would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
 Effective December 31, 2018, the Company completed a one-for-twelve reverse stock split of the common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split was implemented for the purpose of complying with the NYSE American continued listing standards regarding low selling price. 
 On April 17, 2019, the Company received a letter from NYSE American stating that the Company was not in compliance with the 
Exchange’s 
continued listing standards 
under the timely filing criteria outlined in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”) because the 
Company failed to timely file its 
Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2018
. The Company is now subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1007 of the Company Guide
. The Company has been provided a six-month cure period, with an option additional six-month cure period at the discretion of the NYSE American, who reserve the right at any time to immediately truncate the cure period or immediately commence suspension and delisting procedures. Additionally as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s minimum equity was only $0.15 million above the required minimum per the NYSE American continued listing standards relating to stockholders’ equity.

Current Debt Maturities, including Long Term-Debt Classified as Current 
 On February 15, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a debt refinancing (the “Pinecone Credit Facility”) with Pinecone Realty Partners II, LLC (“Pinecone”), with an aggregate principal amount of $16.25 million (which also required a 3.0% or $0.5 million “tail fee” payable upon the maturity date of August 15, 2020), which refinanced existing mortgage debt in an aggregate amount of $8.7 million on three skilled nursing properties known as Attalla, College Park and Northwest (the “Facilities”), and provided additional surplus cash flow of $6.3 million for general corporate needs, after deducting approximately $1.25 million in debt issuance costs and prepayment penalties. The Pinecone Credit Facility originally bore interest at a fixed rate equal to 10% per annum for the first three months after the Closing Date and at a fixed rate equal to 12.5% per annum thereafter, subject to adjustment upon an event of default and specified regulatory events. Regional Health is a guarantor of the Pinecone Credit Facility. Certain of the notes under the Pinecone Credit Facility are also guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Regional Health. The surplus cash flow from the Pinecone Credit Facility was used to fund $2.4 million of self-insurance reserves for professional and general liability claims with respect to 25 professional and general liability actions (settled during the year ended December 31, 2018), and to fund repayment of $1.5 million in 
 8


convertible debt. The remaining $2.4 million in surplus cash proceeds from the Pinecone Credit Facility was used for general corporate purposes.
 On May 10, 2018, Pinecone notified the Company in writing that the Company was in default under certain financial covenants of the loan documents evidencing the Pinecone Credit Facility. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into forbearance agreements with Pinecone with respect to the Pinecone Credit Facility on May 18, 2018 (the “Original Forbearance Agreement”), on September 6, 2018 (the “New Forbearance Agreement”) and again on December 31, 2018 (the “A&R New Forbearance Agreement”). The forbearance period under the Original Forbearance Agreement terminated on July 6, 2018 and the forbearance period under the New Forbearance Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018, in each case because the Company did not satisfy certain conditions set forth therein. The A&R New Forbearance Agreement expired according to its terms on March 14, 2019.
 On March 29, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a second new amended and restated Forbearance Agreement (the “Second A&R Forbearance Agreement”) with Pinecone pursuant to which Pinecone agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement, to forbear for a specified period of time from exercising its default-related rights and remedies (including the acceleration of the outstanding loans and charging interest at the specified default rate) with respect to specified events of default (the “Specified Defaults”) under the Pinecone Credit Facility, dated as of February 15, 2018, among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and Pinecone (the “Loan Agreement”). The forbearance period under the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement commenced on March 29, 2019 and may extend as late as October 1, 2019, unless the forbearance period is earlier terminated as a result of specified termination events, including a default or event of default under the Loan Agreement (other than any Specified Defaults) or any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with the terms of the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s obligation to progress with an Asset Sale (as defined below) in accordance with the timeline specified therein. Accordingly, the forbearance period under the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement may terminate at any time and there is no assurance such period will extend through October 1, 2019. 
 Pursuant to the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement, the Company and Pinecone agreed to amend certain provisions of the Loan Agreement.  The Second A&R Forbearance Agreement  requires, among other things (i) that the Company pursue and complete an asset sale (the “Asset Sale”) which would result in the repayment in full of all of the Company’s indebtedness to Pinecone and, in connection therewith, the Company pay not less than $0.3 million and not more than $0.55 million in forbearance fees, as well as certain other expenses of Pinecone, or (ii) Pinecone’s other disposition of the Loan Agreement as contemplated by the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement. Additionally the Second A&R Forbearance Agreement accelerates the previously disclosed 3% finance “tail fee”, 1% prepayment penalty, and 1% break up fee so that such fees and penalties became part of the principal as of April 15, 2019. 
 On April 30, 2019 the Company extended the April 30, 2019 maturity date on the mortgage indebtedness under the Company’s credit facility with Housing & Healthcare Funding, LLC (the “Quail Creek Credit Facility”) to June 30, 2019, with an option to further extend to July 31, 2019, at the lenders discretion. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to refinance the Quail Creek Credit Facility.
 As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate balance outstanding under the Pinecone Credit Facility is $20.2 million, the approximately $3.45 million increase is due to the forbearance agreements fee’s and associated legal expenses. The balance outstanding under the Quail Creek Credit Facility is $4.1 million. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If these efforts to repay or refinance these liabilities are unsuccessful, the Company may be required to seek relief through a number of other available routes, which may include a filing under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
 For further information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 9 – Notes Payable and Other Debt and Note 19 – Subsequent Events, to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report.
 
Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 The Company made no acquisitions or dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Effective January 15, 2019, the Company’s lease of the Omega Facilities, which leases were due to expire August 2025 and which Omega Facilities the Company subleased to third party subtenants, was terminated by mutual consent of the Company and the lessor(s) and sublessee(s) of the Omega Facilities. In connection with the Omega Lease Termination, the Company transferred approximately $0.4 million of its integral physical fixed assets at the Omega Facilities to the lessor and on January 28, 2019 received from the lessor gross proceeds of approximately $1.5 million, consisting of (i) a termination fee in the amount of $1.2 million and (ii) approximately $0.3 million to satisfy other net amounts due to the Company under the leases. See Note 10 – Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 19 – Subsequent Events to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report.
On April 15, 2019, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Regional Health (collectively, “Seller”) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “PSA”) with affiliates of MED Healthcare Partners LLC (collectively, “Buyer”) with respect to four (4) skilled nursing facilities owned by the Seller. Subject to the terms and conditions of the PSA, the Seller agreed to sell, and the Buyer agreed to purchase, all of the Seller’s right, title and interest in: (a) that certain 182 licensed bed skilled nursing facility commonly known as Attalla Health & Rehab located in Attalla, AL; (b) that certain 100 licensed bed skilled nursing facility commonly known as Healthcare at College Park located in College Park, GA; (c) that certain 118 licensed bed skilled nursing facility commonly known as Quail Creek Nursing & Rehabilitation Center located in Oklahoma City, OK; and (d) that certain 100 licensed bed skilled nursing facility commonly known as Northwest Nursing Center located in Oklahoma City, OK (collectively, the “PSA Facilities”). The Buyer’s obligation to complete such purchase and sale is subject to specified closing conditions, including a thirty (30) day due diligence period (the “Due Diligence Period”). During the Due Diligence Period, the Buyer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate the PSA by written notice to the Seller for any reason or no reason and receive the return of its security deposit. The Due Diligence Period will expire on May, 15 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. 
 The aggregate purchase price for the PSA Facilities is $28.5 million in cash, as prorated and adjusted in accordance with the PSA. Pursuant to the PSA, the Buyer deposited a first deposit of $0.150 million into an escrow account.  A second deposit of $0.150 million is due from the Buyer after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period. If the Buyer does not terminate the PSA for any or no reason prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period and fails to timely make the second deposit of $0.150 million, then such failure shall be a default by the Buyer and the Seller may then elect to terminate the PSA and receive the first deposit as liquidated damages. The closing under the PSA is scheduled for thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period.
 Leasing Transactions
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, the tenants of eight of the Company’s facilities were in arrears’ on their rent payments. Combined cash rental payments for all eight facilities totaled $0.4 million per month, or approximately 21% of our anticipated total monthly rental receipts. Five of these facilities are located in Ohio (the “Ohio Beacon Facilities”) and were leased to affiliates (the “Ohio Beacon Affiliates”) of Beacon Health Management, LLC (“Beacon”). The Ohio Beacon Affiliates, which were ten months in arrears on rental payments, surrendered possession of the Ohio Beacon Facilities to the Company on December 1, 2018 upon the mutual termination of the applicable leases.
 On November 30, 2018 the Company subleased the Ohio Beacon Facilities to affiliates (collectively, “Aspire Sublessees”) of Aspire Regional Partners, Inc. (“Aspire”) management formerly affiliated with MSTC Development Inc., pursuant to separate sublease agreements (the “Aspire Subleases”), whereby the Aspire Sublessees took possession of, and commenced operating, the Ohio Beacon Facilities (under Aspire’s operation, the “Aspire Facilities”) as subtenant, effective December 1, 2018. Annual anticipated minimum cash rent for the next twelve months is approximately $1.8 million, with provision for approximately $0.7 million additional cash rent based on each facility’s prior month occupancy.
 The Aspire Subleases became effective on December 1, 2018 and are structured as triple net leases. The Aspire Facilities are comprised of: (i) a 94-bed skilled nursing facility located in Covington, Ohio (the “Covington Facility”); (ii) an 80-bed assisted living facility located in Springfield, Ohio (the “Eaglewood ALF Facility”); (iii) a 99-bed skilled nursing facility located in Springfield, Ohio (the “Eaglewood Care Center Facility”); (iv) a 50-bed skilled nursing facility located in Greenfield, Ohio (the “H&C of Greenfield Facility”); and (v) a 50-bed skilled 
 10


nursing facility located in Sidney, Ohio (the “Pavilion Care Facility”). Under the Aspire Subleases, a default related to an individual facility may cause a default under all the Aspire Subleases. All Aspire Subleases are for an initial term of ten years, with renewal options, except with respect to the term for the H&C of Greenfield Facility, which has an initial five year term. The Aspire Subleases provide for and set annual rent increases generally commencing in the third lease year; from month seven of the Subleases monthly rent amounts may increase based on each facility’s prior month occupancy, with minimum annual rent escalations of at least 1% generally commencing in the third lease year. Minimum rent receivable for the Covington Care Facility, the Eaglewood ALF Facility, the Eaglewood Care Center Facility, the H&C of Greenfield Facility and the Pavilion Care Facility for the year ended December 31, 2019 is $0.4 million, $0.5 million, $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million per annum, respectively. Additionally, the Company agreed to indemnify Aspire against any and all liabilities imposed on them arising from the former operator, capped at $8.0 million. The Company has assessed the fair value of the indemnity agreements as not material to the financial statements at December 31, 2018.
 For a detailed description of each of the Company’s leases and the resolution of the dispute for the remaining three tenants who were in rent arrears’, see Note 7 - Leases and Note – 19 Subsequent Events to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report.

Industry Trends
 The skilled nursing segment of the long-term care industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for post-acute and custodial healthcare services generated by an aging population, increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting of patient care to lower cost settings. The growth of the senior population in the United States continues to increase healthcare costs, often faster than the available funding from government-sponsored healthcare programs. In response, federal and state governments have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the treatment of patients in more cost effective settings, such as skilled nursing facilities, for which the staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. As a result, skilled nursing facilities are generally serving a larger population of higher acuity patients than in the past.
 The skilled nursing industry is large, highly fragmented, and characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. Based on a decrease in the number of skilled nursing facilities over the past few years, we expect that the supply and demand balance in the skilled nursing industry will continue to improve. We also anticipate that, as life expectancy continues to increase in the United States, notwithstanding the recent declines due to increased deaths amongst younger and middle-aged individuals (due to the overdose epidemic and suicides), the overall demand for skilled nursing services will increase. At present, the primary market demographic for skilled nursing services is primarily individuals age 75 and older. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were over 40 million people in the United States in 2010 that are over 65 years old. The 2010 U.S. Census estimates this group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population and is expected to more than double between 2000 and 2030.
 We believe the skilled nursing industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends. The use of long-term care insurance is increasing among seniors as a means of planning for the costs of skilled nursing care services. In addition, as a result of increased mobility in society, reduction of average family size, and the increased number of two-wage earner couples, more seniors are looking for alternatives outside their own family for their care.
 Competitive Strengths
 As of the date of filing this Annual Report we believe we possess the following competitive strengths:
 Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure. All of our real estate properties are leased under triple-net operating leases with initial terms generally ranging from ten to fifteen years pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance and taxes, and utilities. As of the date of filing this Annual Report, the leases had an average remaining initial term of approximately 8 years. In addition, each lease contains specific rent escalation amounts ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% annually. Further, each lease has one or more renewal options. For those facilities subleased by the Company, the renewal option in the sublease agreement is dependent on the Company’s renewal of its lease agreement. We also typically receive additional security under these leases in the form of security deposits from the lessee and guarantees from the parent or other related entities of the lessee.
 Tenant Diversification. Our 28 properties (including the three facilities that are managed by us and giving effect to the Omega Lease Termination) are operated by a total of 28 separate tenants, with each of our tenants being affiliated with one of eight local or regionally-focused operators. We refer to our tenants who are affiliated with the same operator as a group of affiliated tenants. Each of our operators operate (through a group of affiliated tenants) between two and eight of our facilities, with our most significant operators, C. Ross Management, LLC (“C.R Management”) and Aspire, each operating eight and five facilities, or 28.6% and 17.9% of the total number of our facilities, respectively. We believe that our tenant diversification should limit the effect of any operator’s financial or operating performance decline on our overall performance.
 Geographically Diverse Property Portfolio. Our portfolio of 28 properties, comprising 2,930 operational beds/units, is diversified across six states. Our properties in any one state did not account for more than 46% of our total 
 12


beds/units as of the date of filing this Annual Report. Properties in our largest state, Georgia, are geographically dispersed throughout the state. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of a decline in any one regional market on our overall performance. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy primarily is focused on investing capital in our current portfolio and growing our portfolio through the acquisition of skilled nursing and other healthcare facilities. More specifically, we seek to:
 Focus on Senior Housing Segment. We intend to continue to focus our investment program on senior housing, primarily the skilled nursing facility segment of the long-term care continuum. We have historically been focused on senior housing, and senior management has operating and financial experience and a significant number of relationships in the long-term care industry.  In addition, we believe investing in the sector best meets our investing criteria.
 Invest Capital in Our Current Portfolio. We intend to continue to support our operators by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including facility modernization and potentially replacing or renovating facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive. We expect to structure these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rent or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. We believe such projects will provide an attractive return on capital and improve the underlying performance of facility operations.
 Provide Capital to Underserved Operators. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to long-term care operators through the acquisition and leasing of healthcare properties that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy, but that, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for large healthcare REITs. We seek primarily small to mid-size acquisition transactions with a focus on individual facilities with existing operators, as well as small groups of facilities and larger portfolios. In addition to pursuing acquisitions using triple-net lease structures, we may pursue other forms of investment, including partnering with investors, mortgage loans and joint ventures.
 Identify Talented Operators. As a result of our management team’s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to identify qualified tenants. We seek tenants who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records and focus on patient care.
 Monitor Investments. We monitor our real estate investments through, among other things: (i) reviewing and evaluating tenant financial statements to assess operational and financial trends and performance; (ii) reviewing the state surveys, occupancy rates and patient payor mix of our facilities; (iii) verifying the payments of property and other taxes and insurance with respect to our facilities; and (iv) conducting periodic physical inspections of our facilities.  For tenants or facilities that do not meet performance expectations, we may seek to work with our tenants to ensure our mutual success or seek to re-lease facilities to stronger operators.
 Resolve Legacy Professional and General Liability Claims. As a result of the Transition (which was completed in December 2015), the Company no longer operates skilled nursing facilities. The Company, however, continues to be subject to certain pending professional and general liability actions with respect to the time it operated skilled nursing facilities, including claims that the services the Company provided while an operator resulted in the injury or death of patients and claims related to professional and general negligence, employment, staffing requirements and commercial matters. Management is committed to resolving pending claims. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report.
Competition
 We generally compete for real property investments with publicly traded, private and non-listed healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition challenges our ability to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment criteria, which is affected by, among other factors, the availability of suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and our access to and cost of capital.
 13


Our ability to generate rental revenues from our properties also depends on the competition faced by our tenants. Our tenants compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operating companies that provide comparable services. Our tenants compete to attract and retain patients and residents based on scope and quality of care, reputation and financial condition, price, location and physical appearance of the properties, services offered qualified personnel, physician referrals and family preferences. The ability of our tenants to compete successfully could be affected by private, federal and state reimbursement programs and other laws and regulations.
 Revenue Sources and Recognition
 Triple-Net Leased Properties. The Company’s triple-net leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in rent. The Company recognizes rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In the event the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future collection of rent from one or more tenant(s) of the Company’s facilities, rental income for the affected facilities will be recognized only upon cash collection, and any accumulated straight-line rent receivable will be reversed in the period in which the Company first deems rent collection no longer reasonably assured.
 Management Fee and Other Revenue. The Company recognizes management fee revenues received as services are provided. Further, the Company recognizes income from lease inducement receivables and interest income from loans and investments, using the effective interest method when collectability is reasonably assured. We apply the effective interest method on a loan-by-loan basis.
 Allowances. The Company assesses the collectability of our rent receivables, including straight-line rent receivables. The Company bases its assessment of the collectability of rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. If the Company’s evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that the Company will be unable to receive the rent payments or payments on a working capital loan, the Company provides a reserve against the recognized straight-line rent receivable asset or working capital loan for the portion that we estimate may not be recovered. If the Company changes its assumptions or estimates regarding the collectability of future rent payments required by a lease or required from a working capital loan to a tenant, the Company may adjust its reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue or interest revenue from working capital loans to tenants recognized in the period the Company makes such change in its assumptions or estimates. 
 As December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company reserved for approximately $1.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of gross patient care related receivables arising from its legacy operations. Allowances for patient care receivables are estimated based on an aged bucket method as well as additional analyses of remaining balances incorporating different payor types. Any changes in patient care receivable allowances are recognized as a component of discontinued operations. All uncollected patient care receivables were fully reserved at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  Accounts receivable, net totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2018 compared with $0.9 million at December 31, 2017.
 Government Regulation 
 Healthcare Regulation. Our tenants are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certain certificate of need (“CON”) requirements, government reimbursement, fraud and abuse practices, qualifications of personnel, adequacy of plant and equipment, data privacy and security, and other laws and regulations governing the operation of healthcare facilities. We expect that the healthcare industry will, in general, continue to face increased regulation and pressure in these areas. The applicable rules are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants to civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, including: the possible loss of accreditation or license; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or facility closure. Changes in laws or regulations, reimbursement policies, enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by tenants, operators and managers can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
 14


Although the properties within our portfolio may be subject to varying levels of governmental scrutiny, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Stark Law, the Federal False Claims Act, and comparable state counterparts, as well as cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others.  We also expect that efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers (including health maintenance organizations and other health plans), to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon tenants (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise) will intensify and continue. A significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, existing or future healthcare reform measures, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, changes in enforcement priorities, or significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed or reductions in reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases.
 Licensure, Certification and CONs. In general, the operators of our skilled nursing facilities must be licensed and periodically certified through various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with federal, state and local laws to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Legal requirements pertaining to such licensure and certification relate to the quality of medical care provided by the operator, qualifications of the tenant’s administrative personnel and clinical staff, adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a skilled nursing facility’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations to us.
 In addition, many of our skilled nursing facilities are subject to state CON laws that require governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services. The approval process in these states generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, are also sometimes necessary for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, and investment in major capital equipment, introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. CON laws and regulations may restrict a tenant’s ability to expand our properties and grow its business in certain circumstances, which could have an adverse effect on the tenant’s revenues and, in turn, its ability to make rental payments under and otherwise comply with the terms of our leases. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state healthcare program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control.
 Compared to skilled nursing facilities, seniors housing communities (other than those that receive Medicaid payments) do not receive significant funding from governmental healthcare programs and are subject to relatively few, if any, federal regulations. Instead, to the extent they are regulated, such regulation consists primarily of state and local laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing requirements and other operational matters, which vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Although recent growth in the U.S. seniors housing industry has attracted the attention of various federal agencies that believe more federal regulation of these properties is necessary, Congress thus far has deferred to state regulation of seniors housing communities. However, as a result of this growth and increased federal scrutiny, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of seniors housing communities, and more states are expected to do the same in the future.
 15


Fraud and Abuse Enforcement, Other Related Laws, Initiatives, and Considerations.  Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government healthcare programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, and exclusion from any government healthcare program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government healthcare programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations, and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations.
 Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are also subject to the Federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state Medicaid programs. Further, long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, nurses and other employees, and competitors. Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages and a civil penalty of up to $22,363 per claim.
 Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. Finally, various state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us.
 Other legislative developments, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly expanded the definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private healthcare plans in addition to government payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and The Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Moreover, a significant portion of the billions in healthcare fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts.
 16


Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In order to comply with the regulations, healthcare providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued an interim Final Rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to HITECH, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to $1.5 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions. Additionally, on January 17, 2013, CMS released an omnibus final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws. The final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place. This rule also modified the standard for when a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health information must be reported. Some covered entities have entered into settlement agreements with HHS for allegedly failing to adopt policies and procedures sufficient to implement the breach notification provisions in the HITECH Act. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA privacy standards and HIPAA security standards. HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties.
 There has been an increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement effort and we expect this trend to continue. Under HITECH, state attorneys general have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. Several such actions have already been brought against both covered entities and a business associate, and continued enforcement actions are likely to occur in the future. In addition, HITECH mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby individuals who are harmed by HIPAA violations may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine or monetary settlement paid by the violator.
 In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy, or security of medical records or other types of medical or personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions, in which case they are not preempted by HIPAA. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.
 Also with respect to HIPAA, in September, 2015, OIG issued two reports calling for better privacy oversight of covered entities by the CMS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”). The first report, titled “OCR Should Strengthen its Oversight of Covered Entities’ Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Standards,” found that OCR’s oversight is primarily reactive, as OCR has not fully implemented the required audit program to proactively assess possible noncompliance from covered entities. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR fully implement a permanent audit program and develop a policy requiring OCR staff to check whether covered entities had previously been investigated for noncompliance. The second report, titled “OCR Should Strengthen its Follow-up of Breaches of Patient Information Reported by Covered Entities,” found that (1) OCR did not record corrective action information for 23% of closed “large-breach” cases in which it made determinations of noncompliance, and (2) OCR did not record “small-breach” information in its case-tracking system, which limits its ability to track and identify covered entities with multiple small breaches. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR enter small-breach information into its case-tracking system and maintain complete documentation of corrective actions taken. OCR agreed with OIG’s recommendations in both reports. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our tenants.
 17


More recently with respect to HIPAA, OCR announced on March 21, 2016, that it has begun a new phase of audits of covered entities and their business associates. OCR stated that it will review policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.
 Congress has significantly increased funding to the governmental agencies charged with enforcing the healthcare fraud and abuse laws to facilitate increased audits, investigations and prosecutions of providers suspected of healthcare fraud. As a result, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against healthcare providers have increased significantly in recent years and are expected to continue. A violation of federal or state anti-fraud and abuse laws or regulations, or other related laws or regulations discussed above, by a tenant of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the tenant’s liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases.
 
Government Reimbursement
 The majority of skilled nursing facilities’ (“SNF”) reimbursement is through Medicare and Medicaid. These programs are often their largest source of funding. Senior housing communities generally do not receive funding from Medicare or Medicaid, but their ability to retain their residents is impacted by policy decisions and initiatives established by the administrators of Medicare and Medicaid. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Healthcare Reform Law”). The passage of the Healthcare Reform Law allowed formerly uninsured Americans to acquire coverage and utilize additional healthcare services. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law gave the CMS new authorities to implement Medicaid waiver and pilot programs that impact healthcare and long term custodial care reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid. These activities promote “aging in place”, allowing senior citizens to stay longer in seniors housing communities, and diverting or delaying their admission into SNFs. In December, 2017, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance effective January 1, 2019. In December 2018, as a result of the penalty associated with the individual mandate being eliminated, a federal court in Texas found that the entire Healthcare Reform Law was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. Additionally, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Healthcare Reform Law. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these developments on our tenants. The potential risks, however, that accompany these regulatory and market changes are discussed below.

• | Enabled by the Medicare Modernization Act (2003) and subsequent laws, Medicare and Medicaid have implemented pilot programs (officially termed demonstrations or models) to “divert” elderly from SNFs and promote “aging in place” in “the least restrictive environment.” Several states have implemented Home and Community-based Medicaid waiver programs that increase the support services available to senior citizens in senior housing, lengthening the time that many seniors can live outside of a SNF. These Medicaid waiver programs are subject to re-approval and pilots are time-limited. Roll-back or expiration of these programs could have an adverse effect on the senior housing market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in certification and participation requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs have restricted, and are likely to continue to restrict further, eligibility for reimbursement under those programs. On October 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule that, for the first time in nearly 25 years, comprehensively updated the SNF requirements for participation under Medicare and Medicaid. Among other things, the rule implemented requirements relating to quality of care and quality of life, facility responsibilities and staffing considerations, resident assessments, and compliance and ethics programs. The requirements are being implemented in phases with the final phase to be implemented by November 28, 2019. We cannot accurately predict the effect the final rule will have on our tenants’ business once it is fully promulgated. Failure to obtain and maintain Medicare and Medicaid certification by our tenants would result in denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments which would likely result in a significant loss of revenue. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting in lost revenue for specific patients. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts, and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue. Any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ profitability and cash flows which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. We are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on our tenants’ operations. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our tenants or on their ability to fulfill their obligations to us.

• | As a result of the Healthcare Reform Law, and specifically Medicaid expansion and establishment of Health Insurance Exchanges providing subsidized health insurance, more Americans have health insurance. These newly insured Americans utilize services delivered by providers at medical buildings and other healthcare facilities. The Healthcare Reform Law remains controversial and continued attempts to repeal or reverse aspects of the law (see discussion in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report concerning a possible repeal of Healthcare Reform Law) could result in insured individuals losing coverage, and consequently foregoing services offered by provider tenants in medical buildings and other healthcare facilities. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Healthcare Reform Law but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allowed states to decline to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion—without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is still unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government paid for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, the federal matching rate decreased to 93% in 2019. We cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal or amend the Healthcare Reform Law will be successful. Even absent changes to the Healthcare Reform Law, the executive branch of the federal government may make significant changes to the enforcement and implementation of Healthcare Reform Law requirements. We cannot predict the impact that any such repeal or amendment of the Healthcare Reform Law or related action by the executive branch would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us. We cannot predict whether the existing Healthcare Reform Law, or future healthcare reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business. If the operations, cash flows, or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially and adversely impacted by the Healthcare Reform Law or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well.

• | CMS is currently in the midst of transitioning Medicare from a traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model to capitated, value-based, and bundled payment approaches in which the government pays a set amount for each beneficiary for a defined period of time, based on that person’s underlying medical needs, rather than the actual services provided. The result is increasing use of management tools to oversee individual providers and coordinate their services. This puts downward pressure on the number and expense of services provided. Roughly eight-million Medicare beneficiaries now receive care via Accountable Care Organizations, and Medicare Advantage health plans now provide care for roughly seventeen-million Medicare beneficiaries. The continued trend toward capitated, value-based, and bundled payment approaches has the potential to diminish the market for certain healthcare providers. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was enacted, which implements value-based purchasing for SNFs. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, 2% of SNF payments will be withheld and approximately 50% to 70% of the amount withheld will be paid to SNFs through value-based payments. SNFs began reporting the claims-based 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Measure on October 1, 2015 and began reporting a resource use measure on October 1, 2016. Both measures are publicly available.

• | In October 2015, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) released a report recommending that CMS continue to improve data and oversight of nursing home quality measures. The GAO found that although CMS collects several types of data that give some insight into the quality of nursing homes, the data could provide a clearer picture of nursing home quality if some underlying problems with the data (i.e., the use of self-reported data and non-standardized survey methodologies) are corrected. The GAO recommended, among other things, that CMS implement a clear plan for ongoing auditing of self-reported data and establish a process for monitoring oversight modifications to better assess their effects. According to the GAO, timely completion of these actions is particularly important because Medicare payments to nursing homes will be dependent on quality data, through the implementation of the value based purchasing program, starting in fiscal year 2019. HHS agreed with the GAO’s recommendations, and to the extent such recommendations are implemented, they could impact our operators and tenants.

• | The majority of Medicare payments continue to be made through traditional Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service schedules. The Medicare and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) addressed the risk of a Sustainable Growth Rate cut in Medicare payments for physician services. However, other annual Medicare payment regulations, particularly with respect to certain hospitals, skilled nursing care, and home health services, have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected. In addition, MACRA established a multi-year transition into pay-for-quality approaches for Medicare physicians and other providers. This includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards. The current Value-Based Payment Modifier program expired at the end of 2018, with the first Merit-based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) adjustments beginning in 2019. The continued implementation of pay-for-quality models is expected to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in medical buildings and other healthcare properties.

• | OIG has increased focus in recent years on billing practices by SNFs. In September 2015, OIG issued a report calling for reevaluation of the Medicare payment system for SNFs. In particular, OIG found that Medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded SNFs’ costs for therapy, and that, under the current payment system, SNFs increasingly billed for the highest level of therapy even though key beneficiary characteristics remained largely the same. OIG determined that its findings demonstrated the need for CMS to reevaluate the Medicare SNF payment system, concluding that payment reform could save Medicare billions of dollars and encourage SNFs to provide services that are better aligned with beneficiaries’ care needs. OIG formulates a formal work plan each year for nursing centers. OIG’s most recent work plan indicates that among other things, OIG’s investigative and review focus in 2019 for nursing-facilities will include analysis of nursing facility staffing and review on inpatient claims subject to the post-acute care transfers policy. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our tenants. We cannot predict the likelihood, scope, or outcome of any such investigations on our tenants if these recommendations are implemented.

• | In 2019, CMS will include the new long-term-stay hospitalization measurement that the agency began tracking in 2018 in its quality measures for the consumer-based Nursing Home Compare website. CMS also began posting the number of hours worked by a facility’s non-nursing staff in July, 2018 and, in October 2019, will resume posting the average number of citations per inspection for each state and the nation as a whole, which may affect each facility’s health inspection rating on the site. We cannot predict how this data will affect our tenants’ business.

• | On July 29, 2016, CMS issued its final rule laying out the performance standards relating to preventable hospital readmissions from SNFs. The final rule includes the SNF 30-day All Cause Readmission Measure, which assesses the risk-standardized rates of all-cause, all conditions, unplanned inpatient readmissions for Medicare fee-for-service patients of SNFs within 30 days of discharge from admission to an inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) hospital, critical access hospital (“CAH”), or psychiatric hospital. The final rule includes the SNF 30-Day Potentially Preventable Readmission Measure as the SNF all condition risk adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission measure. This measure assesses the facility-level risk-standardized rate of unplanned, potentially preventable hospital readmissions for SNF patients within 30 days of discharge from a prior admission to an IPPS hospital, CAH, or psychiatric hospital. Hospital readmissions include readmissions to a short-stay acute-care hospital or CAH, with a diagnosis considered to be unplanned and potentially preventable.

• | On September 16, 2016, CMS issued its final rule concerning emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare and Medicaid participating providers, including long-term care facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The rule is designed to ensure providers and suppliers have comprehensive and integrated emergency policies and procedures in place, in particular during natural and man-made disasters. Under the rule, facilities are required to (i) document risk assessment and emergency planning, (ii) develop and implement policies and procedures based on that risk assessment, (iii) develop and maintain an emergency preparedness communication plan in compliance with both federal and state law, and (iv) develop and maintain an emergency-preparedness training and testing program. Facilities were required to have been in compliance with these regulations by November 15, 2017. We cannot predict the impact of these regulations on our tenants.

• | On February 8, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”) extending the reduction in Medicare provider payments commonly called the “sequestration.” This automatic payment reduction remains at 2% and applies to all Medicare physician claims and certain other claims, including physician-administered medications, submitted after April 1, 2013. Scheduled to expire in 2025, the BBA extended the sequestration through 2027.

• | On July 31, 2018, CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2019 Medicare payment rates and quality programs for SNFs. The policies in the final rule continue to shift Medicare payments from volume to value by implementing SNF Value-Based Purchasing program (“VBP”) and SNF Quality Reporting Program (“QRP”). Additionally, effective October 1, 2019, CMS will be using the Patient Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”), which focuses on the patient’s condition and resulting care needs rather than on the amount of care provided in order to determine Medicare payment. Based on changes contained within this final rule, CMS estimates that the fiscal year 2019 aggregate impact will be an increase of $820 million in Medicare payments to SNFs, resulting from the fiscal year 2019 SNF market basket update required to be 2.4% by the BBA. Absent the application of this statutory requirement, the fiscal year 2019 market basket update factor would have been 2.0 % which reflects the SNF fiscal year 2019 market basket index of 2.8%, reduced by the multifactor productivity adjustment of 0.8 %. The effect of the 2019 PPS rate update on our tenants’ revenues will be dependent upon their census and the mix of patients at the various PPS and PDPM pay rates. In addition, we cannot predict how future changes may impact reimbursement rates under the SNF PPS and PDPM system.

 We are neither an ongoing participant in, nor a direct recipient of, any reimbursement under these programs with respect to our facilities. However, a significant portion of the revenue of the healthcare operators to which we lease and sublease properties is derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, and any adverse change in such programs could negatively impact an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us.
 Environmental Regulation
 As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters.
 These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and, in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. Although we do not currently operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of our current and former properties from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release.
 Under the terms of our leases, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants of our properties for any contamination caused by them. However, there is no assurance that our tenants will have the financial capability or willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness to do so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental claims. In general, we have also agreed to indemnify our tenants against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, our properties at any time before the applicable lease commencement date.
 We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2017 or 2018.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 16 employees of which 11 were full-time employees (excluding facility-level employees related to the Company’s management services agreement for three facilities in Ohio).
