Human Nutrition & Health
Our Human Nutrition & Health ("HNH") segment provides human grade choline nutrients and mineral amino acid chelated products through this segment for wellness applications. Choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants, processing dietary fat, reproductive development and neural functions, such as memory and muscle function. Our mineral amino acid chelates, specialized mineral salts, and mineral complexes are used as raw materials for inclusion in premier human nutrition products. Proprietary technology has been combined to create an organic molecule in a form the body can readily assimilate. Sales growth for human nutrition applications is reliant on differentiation from lower-cost competitive products through scientific data, intellectual property and customer perceptions of brand value. Consequently, we make investments in such activities for long-term value differentiation. We also serve the food and beverage industry for beverage, bakery, dairy, confectionary, and savory manufacturers. We partner with our customers from ideation through commercialization to bring on-trend beverages, baked goods, confections, dairy and meat products to market. Our expertise in trends analysis and product development, combined with our manufacturing capabilities in customized spray dried and emulsified powders, blended lipid systems, liquid flavor delivery systems, juice and dairy bases, chocolate systems, as well as ice cream bases and variegates makes us a one-stop solutions provider for beverage and dairy product development needs. Additionally, we provide microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food, pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification, processing, mixing, and packaging applications and shelf-life. Major product applications are baked goods, refrigerated and frozen dough systems, processed meats, seasoning blends, confections, and nutritional supplements. We also create cereal systems for ready-to-eat cereals, grain-based snacks, and cereal based ingredients.
Animal Nutrition & Health
Our Animal Nutrition & Health (“ANH”) segment provides nutritional products derived from our microencapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to basic choline chloride. For ruminant animals, our microencapsulated products boost health and milk production, delivering nutrient supplements that are biologically available, providing required nutritional levels. Our proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals and is marketed for use in animal feed throughout the world. ANH also manufactures and supplies choline chloride, an essential nutrient for monogastric animal health, predominantly to the poultry, pet and swine industries. Choline, which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms, plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat. In poultry, choline deficiency can result in reduced growth rates and perosis in young birds, while in swine production choline is a necessary and required component of gestating and lactating sow diets for both liver health and prevention of leg deformity.
Sales of value-added encapsulated products are highly dependent on overall industry economics as well our ability to leverage the results of university and field research on the animal health benefits of our products. Management believes that success in the 
commodity-oriented basic choline chloride marketplace is highly dependent on our ability to maintain our strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service. We continue to drive production efficiencies in order to maintain our competitive-cost position to effectively compete in a global marketplace.
Specialty Products
Ethylene oxide, at the 100% level, is sold as a sterilant gas, primarily for use in the health care industry. It is used to sterilize a wide range of medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or soft surfaces, composites, metals, tubing and different types of plastics without negatively impacting the performance of the device being sterilized. Our 100% ethylene oxide product is distributed in uniquely designed, recyclable, double-walled, stainless steel drums to assure compliance with safety, quality and environmental standards as outlined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Our inventory of these specially built drums, along with our two filling facilities, represents a significant capital investment. Contract sterilizers and medical device manufacturers are principal customers for this product. We also sell single use canisters with 100% ethylene oxide for use in sterilizing re-usable devices typically processed in autoclave units in hospitals. As a fumigant, ethylene oxide blends are highly effective in killing bacteria, fungi, and insects in spices and other seasoning materials.
Propylene oxide is marketed and sold as a fumigant to aid in the control of insects and microbiological spoilage; and to reduce bacterial and mold contamination in certain shell and processed nut meats, processed spices, cacao beans, cocoa powder, raisins, figs and prunes. We distribute our propylene oxide product primarily in recyclable, single-walled, carbon steel cylinders according to standards outlined by the EPA and the DOT. Our inventory of these cylinders also represents a significant capital investment. Propylene oxide is also sold to customers seeking smaller (as opposed to bulk) quantities and whose requirements include utilization in various chemical synthesis applications, such as increasing paint durability and manufacturing specialty starches and textile coatings.
Our micronutrient agricultural nutrition business sells chelated minerals primarily into high value crops.  We have a unique and patented two-step approach to solving mineral deficiency in plants to optimize health, yield and shelf-life.  First, we determine optimal mineral balance for plant health. We then have a foliar applied Metalosate® product range, utilizing patented amino acid chelate technology. Our products quickly and efficiently deliver mineral nutrients. As a result, the farmer/grower gets healthier crops that are more resistant to disease and pests, larger yields and healthier food for the consumer with extended shelf life for produce being shipped long distances.
Industrial Products
Certain derivatives of choline chloride are manufactured and sold into industrial applications predominately as a component for hydraulic fracturing of shale natural gas wells. Our products offer an attractive, effective and more environmentally responsible alternative than other clay stabilizers. Industrial grade choline bicarbonate is completely chloride free and our choline chloride reduces the amount of chlorides released into the environment up to 75% when compared to potassium chloride. The Industrial Products segment also includes the manufacture and sale of methylamines. Methylamines are a primary building block for the manufacture of choline products and are produced at our Italian operation and sold for a wide range of industrial applications in Europe.
Acquisitions
On June 1, 2017, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of Innovative Food Processors, Inc. (“IFP”), a privately held manufacturer of agglomerated and microencapsulated food and nutrition ingredients, headquartered in Faribault, Minnesota. We made payments of approximately $22,975 on the acquisition date and $635 in September to true-up working capital, amounting to approximately $16,161 to the former shareholders, adjustments for working capital acquired of $5,065, and $2,384 to IFP’s lenders to pay off all IFP bank debt. The acquisition of IFP expanded our Human Nutrition & Health segment’s processing technology and market reach, and brought innovative and value-added systems to food, beverage, and nutrition customers.
We also completed one immaterial acquisition in 2017, Chol-Mix Kft, and another immaterial acquisition in 2018, Bioscreen Technologies Srl.
Raw Materials
The raw materials utilized by us in the manufacture of our products are sourced from suppliers both domestically and internationally. Such raw materials include materials derived from petrochemicals, minerals, metals, agricultural commodities and other readily available commodities and are subject to price fluctuations due to market conditions. We are not experiencing any current difficulties in procuring such materials and do not anticipate any such problems; however, we cannot assure that will always be the case.
Intellectual Property
We currently hold 110 patents in the United States and overseas and use certain trade-names and trademarks. We also use know-how, trade secrets, formulae, and manufacturing techniques that assist in maintaining competitive positions of certain of our products. Formulae and know-how are of particular importance in the manufacture of a number of our proprietary products. We believe that certain of our patents, in the aggregate, are advantageous to our business. However, it is believed that no single patent or related group of patents is currently so material to us that the expiration or termination of any single patent or group of patents would materially affect our business. Our U.S. patents expire between 2019 and 2034. We believe that our sales and competitive position are dependent primarily upon the quality of our products, technical sales efforts and market conditions, rather than on patent protection.
Seasonality
In general, the businesses of our segments are not seasonal to any material extent.
Backlog
At December 31, 2018, we had a total backlog of $37,021 (including $26,432 for the HNH segment; $9,149 for the ANH segment; $549 for the Specialty Products segment and $891 for the Industrial Products segment), as compared to a total backlog of $41,270 at December 31, 2017 (including $27,098 for the HNH segment; $11,041 for the ANH segment; $573 for the Specialty Products segment and $2,558 for the Industrial Products segment). It has generally been our policy and practice to maintain an inventory of finished products and/or component materials for our segments to enable us to ship products within two months after receipt of a product order. All orders in the current backlog are expected to be filled in the 2019 fiscal year.
Competition
Our competitors include many large and small companies, some of which have greater financial, research and development, production and other resources than us. Competition in the supplement, food and beverage markets we serve are based primarily on product performance, customer support, quality, service and price. The development of new and improved products is important to our success. This competitive environment requires substantial investments in product and manufacturing process research and development. In addition, the winning and retention of customer acceptance of our food and nutrition products involve substantial expenditures for application testing, either internally or at customer/prospect sites, and sales efforts. Our competition in this market includes a variety of ingredient and nutritional supplement companies many of which are privately-held. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the size of all of our segment competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors.
Competition in the animal feed and industrial markets we serve are based primarily on product performance, customer support, quality, service and price. The markets for our products are subject to competitive risks because these markets are highly price competitive. Our competition in this market includes a variety of animal nutrition and health ingredient companies, along with certain industrial companies, many of which are privately-held. Therefore, we are unable to assess the size of all of our competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors.
In the Specialty Products segment, our products face competition from alternative sterilizing technologies and products. Competition in this marketplace is based primarily on medical device compositions, product performance, customer support, quality, service and price. Our competition in this market includes sterilization companies, a number of which are privately-held. Therefore, we are unable to assess the size of all of our competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors. We are focused on the North American market due to EPA, United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and DOT regulations that are not yet required globally.
Research & Development
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $11,592, $9,305, and $7,325, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development for new products, improvements to existing products, and manufacturing processes. We have historically funded our research and development programs with funds available from current operations with the intent of recovering those costs from profits derived from future sales of products resulting from, or enhanced by, the research and development effort.
We prioritize our product development activities in an effort to allocate resources to those product candidates that, we believe, have the greatest commercial potential. Factors we consider in determining the products to pursue include projected markets and needs, status of our proprietary rights, technical feasibility, expected and known product attributes, and estimated costs to bring the product to market.
Capital Projects
We continue to invest in projects across all production facilities and capital expenditures were approximately $19,170, $27,526, and $23,034 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, we invested $5,662 to expand capacity in key product lines in the Human Nutrition & Health segment along with upgrading automation systems in our manufacturing sites to drive efficiencies. In addition, we invested $3,137 for environmental, health, safety, and security upgrades to our facilities. In 2017, we spent approximately $13,200 to expand manufacturing capacity at our AMT facility in Utah to accommodate production previously manufactured in Clearfield, UT prior to the site fire. In 2016, capital expenditures of $1,800 were related to expanding our Animal Nutrition & Health capacity in the manufacturing facility located in Verona, Missouri. Additionally, we invested $6,800 in agglomeration production equipment during 2016. Capital expenditures are projected to range from $30,000 to $40,000 for 2019.
Environmental / Regulatory Matters
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), a health and safety statute, requires that certain products within our specialty products segment must be registered with the EPA because they are considered pesticides. In order to obtain a registration, an applicant typically must demonstrate, through extensive test data, that its product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. We hold EPA registrations permitting us to sell ethylene oxide as a medical device sterilant and spice fumigant, and propylene oxide as a fumigant of nuts and spices.
In April 2008, the EPA issued an RED (“Reregistration Eligibility Decision”) for ethylene oxide which permitted the continued use of ethylene oxide “to sterilize medical or laboratory equipment, pharmaceuticals, and aseptic packaging, or to reduce microbial load on musical instruments, cosmetics, whole and ground spices and other seasoning materials and artifacts, archival material or library objects”. Currently, the EPA has initiated a new registration review of ethylene oxide, in line with and part of the registration review scheduled for a large number of other pesticides. A Final Work Plan was issued in March 2014. The EPA anticipates this registration review process will take approximately seven years. As part of this review process, the EPA identified several testing requirements. To date, after discussion with EPA staff and submission of pertinent information, the EPA has issued waivers for four studies and one required study was submitted and accepted. Several waiver requests are still under consideration, and additional information has been requested. In December 2016, the EPA issued its Integrated Risk Information System (“IRIS”) assessment of EO, another aspect of EPA’s safety review of EO. To date, we have no knowledge of how this IRIS assessment will impact the registration review process. While some additional testing will be necessary, we believe that the use of ethylene oxide will continue to be permitted. The product, when used as a sterilant for certain medical devices, has no known equally effective substitute. Management believes the lack of availability of this product could not be easily tolerated by various medical device manufacturers or the health care industry due to the resultant infection potential.
Similarly, the EPA issued a RED for propylene oxide in August 2006. At that time, the EPA “determined that products containing the active ingredient PPO [propylene oxide] are eligible for reregistration provided that…risk mitigation measures…are adopted.” Our product label was amended as required to reflect these mitigation measures and also to show that propylene oxide has been reclassified as a restricted use pesticide. Currently, the EPA has initiated a new registration review of propylene oxide, in line with and part of the registration review scheduled for a large number of other pesticides. A Final Work Plan was issued in March 2014. The EPA anticipates this review process will take approximately seven years. As part of the process, the EPA has identified several potential additional testing requirements. We have completed six of the required studies and they were submitted to the EPA for evaluation. Two of those studies have been deemed accepted, and the other four are still being evaluated. A waiver has been granted for one study. We are currently in discussions with the EPA regarding other studies. While it is possible that we will be required to perform additional testing, we believe that the use of propylene oxide to treat nuts and spices will continue to be permitted.
Our facility in Verona, Missouri, while held by a prior owner, was designated by the EPA as a Superfund site and placed on the National Priorities List in 1983, because of dioxin contamination on portions of the site. Remediation was conducted by the prior owner under the oversight of the EPA and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (“MDNR”). While we must maintain the integrity of the capped areas in the remediation areas on the site, the prior owner is responsible for completion of any further Superfund remedy. We are indemnified by the sellers under our May 2001 asset purchase agreement covering our acquisition of the Verona facility for potential liabilities associated with the Superfund site and one of the sellers, in turn, has the benefit of certain contractual indemnification by the prior owner that executed the above-described Superfund remedy.
In connection with normal operations at our plant facilities, we are required to maintain environmental and other permits, including those relating to the ethylene oxide operations.
We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with federal, state, local and international provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Such compliance includes the maintenance of required permits under air pollution regulations and compliance with requirements of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The cost of such compliance has not had a material effect upon the results of our operations or our financial condition. 
We produce products which are required to be manufactured in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations as interpreted and enforced by the FDA, through third party contract arrangement. Modifications, enhancements or changes in contracted manufacturing facilities or procedures relating to our pharmaceutical products are, in many circumstances, subject to FDA approval, which may be subject to a lengthy application process or which we may be unable to obtain. Any contracted manufacturing facilities that manufacture our pharmaceutical products are periodically subject to inspection by the FDA and other governmental agencies, and operations at these facilities could be interrupted or halted if the results of these inspections are unsatisfactory.
