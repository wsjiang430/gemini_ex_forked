 Overview 
 Identiv, Inc. is a global provider of physical security and secure identification. Our products, software, systems, and services address the markets for physical and logical access control, video analytics and a wide range of Radio Frequency Identification (“RFID”)-enabled applications. Customers in government, enterprise, consumer, education, healthcare, banking, retail, transportation and other sectors rely on our security and identification solutions. Our mission is to make the physical world digital and secure. Our platform to deliver on our mission can be deployed through Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices, mobile, client/server, cloud, web, dedicated hardware and software-defined architectures.  Our solutions encompass what we believe to be the most complete set of technologies in the industry.  We are a one-stop shop for software delivering physical security management, video surveillance, logical access, analytics and identities; and devices spanning access readers, panels, processing appliances, and identity cards.  We provide services to deliver optimized total solutions, serving as a single-point provider for our customers rather than several separate vendors that the customer would otherwise have to coordinate and manage.
 The foundation of our business is our deep technical expertise across RFID, smart card technology, and physical security technologies from hardware to software.  Our close customer relationships and analytics platforms allow us to develop customer-relevant products and applications.  This is all underpinned by our core value of uncompromising quality.
 To deliver these solutions, we have organized our operations into two reportable business segments, principally by solution families: Premises and Identity. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we realigned the way in which we organize our operating segments in making operating decisions and assessing financial performance by combining our Identity and Credentials segments. The combined segment is now referred to as the Identity segment. All comparative segment information for fiscal 2017 has been combined to conform to the fiscal 2018 presentation.
 Premises
 The Premises segment includes our solutions to address the premises security market for government and enterprise, including access control, video surveillance, analytics, customer experience and other applications.

Our physical security platform is anchored by the Hirsch Velocity management software, our line of controllers including the advanced MX line, our TouchSecure access readers, a wide range of integrations and our Identiv Global Services team that develops optimized solutions for our customers’ total business and security environment, incorporating our products and partner products that together best serve our customers’ goals. We have further extended our physical access platform with our Identiv Connected Physical Access Manager (“ICPAM”) software, derived from Cisco’s Physical Access Manager (“CPAM”) system.  
 In February 2018, we acquired 3VR Security, Inc. (“3VR”), a video technology and analytics company. With the acquisition, we added the 3VR video security and analytics platform, which is a natural complement to our physical access offering.  Nearly all customers for access control are customers for video security, and vice versa.  Additionally, the events and data generated by both platforms combine to create what we believe to be uniquely valuable information for our customers to provide frictionless yet robust security.  3VR’s platform is architected as an analytics system, proven across applications in the retail, banking, and other vertical markets, and valuable to our physical security markets in government, education, critical infrastructure, transportation and others. In addition to technology, 3VR brought deep market presence, across over 170 banks, installations with over 50,000 cameras under our software’s management, top-tier retailers, and a 100% U.S.-made platform. 
 In January 2019, we acquired substantially all assets of the Freedom, Liberty, and Enterphone™ MESH products and services of Viscount Systems, Inc. (“Viscount”). The web-based Freedom and Liberty access control and Enterphone MESH IP telephone entry solutions are known for their early adoption of a web, API-based, cloud-ready architecture, creating an IT-centric software-focused and hardware-light platform. Scaling from small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMB”) up to enterprise scale for government and commercial markets, Freedom and the entry-level Liberty product line are complementary to our other products. With Freedom, customers can build integrated access control and video management systems under one centrally managed or distributed network, seamlessly integrating physical security devices such as card readers, ID management, Active Directory/LDAP, visitor entry, alarm points, and video applications and analytics. We believe the combination creates one of the most-advanced, IT-centric solutions for physical security, delivering a seamless evolution from traditional physical access models to next-generation, cloud and web-based, and mobile-enabled systems. Our TouchSecure (“TS”) readers, TS Cards, VMS platform, mobile logical access and our Identiv Global Services (“IGS”) services are applicable to nearly all Freedom and Liberty customers.
 We sell either individual components or complete bundled solutions which can include any or all among software, edge controllers, IoT devices, multi-door panels, access readers, access cards, 3VR appliances and other components or services, some of which are detailed below: 
 Premises Software — Our software platform for premises security ranges from physical access to video analytics and business intelligence. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail. Velocity continues to be especially successful with federal and state government customers. The Freedom and Liberty platforms present an IT-centric and highly scalable alternative, specifically for the SMB market. We believe our ICPAM software platform is ideal for the Cisco and wider IT channel, and is tightly integrated with Cisco’s VSM video management system as well as their IP telephony infrastructure. We believe our 3VR VisionPoint™ VMS (Video Management System) for real-time search is an ideal video management software for forensic search, case management and business intelligence. Available in both a Standard and Pro version, with an optional enterprise server for large and remote deployments, VisionPoint VMS provides tools to gather intelligence from video, speed up searches and easily develop cases. VisionPoint VMS can be installed on commercial off-the-shelf hardware, on certified partner hardware, and is included on any of 3VR’s powerful NVR/HVR appliances.
 Controllers — Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. Our Freedom Crypto and IoT Bridges provide hardware-light solutions, providing low-cost implementations and building a bridge to fully software-defined, hardware-light (or hardware-free) access platforms.
 FICAM — We believe our Velocity, MX and TS Reader solution is the highest performance, lowest per-door cost access control system for the U.S. federal government security mandate known as the Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management (“FICAM”) architecture.  Our solution brings all of the advantages above into the next generation of physical security for the U.S. government departments and agencies to achieve Federal Information Processing Standard (“FIPS”) 201 compliance. Similar to our leading Hirsch Velocity solution for the U.S. government market, the Freedom platform acquired from Viscount is also FICAM-compliant and allows customers to choose an evolutionary, alternative architecture going forward. Within FICAM, the most infrastructure-efficient architecture is a specification known as 13.02.  With Freedom and Velocity, we now are the only vendor providing two 13.02-compliant solutions, and we represent half of the four 13.02 approved solutions at this time.
 4

Access Readers — Our TS readers feature multiple layers of security based on a certified hardware security element. These door readers provide unique features to support a wide range of security standards. We support the majority of legacy cards with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication ("NFC") and government-issued credentials including Common Access Card (“CAC”), Personal Identification Verification (“PIV”), Personal Identification Verification – Interoperable (“PIV-I”) and others. Additionally, our Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered, and providing both secure two-factor authentication and convenient alternative-factor access. 
 Identiv Global Services —  Identiv Global Services provides a comprehensive catalog of end-to-end services that facilitates customer success, drives deeper adoption of our product portfolio and encourages long-term customer engagement.  IGS supports customers throughout their premises security lifecycle from system design, to integration, deployment and managed services.  IGS experts enable customers to address today’s complex security and IT systems interoperability requirements, and helps them achieve a tailor-made solution.
 Identity
 The Identity segment includes our products and solutions enabling secure access to information serving the logical access and cyber security market and protecting assets and objects in the IoT with RFID. 
 Information security solutions range from securing enterprise information access and secure transactions across PCs, networks, mobile devices, email, login, secure payments, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and applications.
 Our information security products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical access (i.e., PC, network or data access) and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.  Through our acquisition of Thursby Software Systems (“TSS”) in November of 2018, as well as our internal product development, we provide mobile apps, software and systems to enable secure and convenient logical access across smart cards and derived credentials on Apple iOS and Android mobile devices. Our solutions include: 
 Mobile Security — TSS’ software solutions provide strong security for enterprise and personal mobility, supporting bring-your-own-device (“BYOD”) and two-factor authentication (“2FA”) on mobile devices. We enable Department of Defense (“DoD”) issued CAC, federally issued PIV cards, derived credentials, and commercially issued PIV-I cards to access, sign, encrypt, and decrypt information and emails from Apple iOS and Android mobile phones or tablet devices. These capabilities have allowed over a hundred thousand DoD and federal employees, including the U.S. Navy Reserve, via the Ready-2-Serve (“R2S”) mobile application, to use personal and government-furnished mobile devices to access needed information on-the-go. Prior to the acquisition, TSS had sold more than one million software licenses to a range of customers and industries, including government, healthcare, finance, energy, education, research, Fortune 500, Global 2000, and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). 
 We have established a leading position as a trusted provider of convenient high-security solutions to government and enterprise customers.   Our products are customizable to specific customer preferences, providing both high security and excellent end-user convenience.  TSS’ seamless support of both government-grade smart card deployments and derived credentials reflects our philosophy of supporting customers' adoption of technologies at their own pace, optimized for their own use cases.
 Smart Card Readers — With over 20 years of smart card reader, application and token experience, and over 40 million smart card readers and modules deployed, we are known for our expertise in this complex ecosystem.  We combine our deep technical expertise with an optimized supply chain, to provide what we believe to be the most optimal, cost-effective and high-quality smart card-based reader products.  Whether Identiv branded products, OEM branded, or embedded chips or modules, we are a trusted business solution provider for users and issuers of smart cards and embedded-chip applications.
 Our RFID based solutions address a wide range of applications from access control to asset tracking, product authenticity, brand protection, customer engagement, tamper detection, product instrumentation, transportation access and other IoT applications. The RFID devices enable frictionless interaction with the physical world and are grouped into transponders and access cards. 
 Transponders — Our transponder products span the full range of high frequency (“HF”) and ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) technologies.  Our differentiation is analogous to application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICS”) in the semiconductor market.  We leverage our flexible platform, our deep technical expertise and our infrastructure and supply chain to deliver solutions optimized for our customers’ business goals.  We believe we are more responsive, more flexible, more experienced in business-optimized solutions and have a better track record of sustained delivery of solution-specific, high-quality RFID devices than our competitors.  These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in diverse physical applications, including electronic entertainment such as virtual reality (“VR”), games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management, cold-chain management and many others.  
 5

Access Cards — Our uTrust cards encompass contactless single-technology, multi-technology, or credentials with a contact chip, including uTrust Proximity Credentials, uTrust Smart ID Secure Credentials, uTrust MIFARE Classic Credentials, and our uTrust TS Cards. This gives our customers easy access to RFID technology for reliable data exchange of physical access control system (PACS) data, up to options for versatile, high-frequency, interoperable, MIFARE-compatible smart cards. Our uTrust TS Cards address emerging security requirements while maintaining compatibility with existing low-security standards such as prox. We believe they offer the first complete solution to allow customers to pay only for the most basic low-frequency proximity access technology while having the ability to evolve to the higher-security high-frequency and highest-security public key infrastructure (“PKI”) based credentials. This product line exemplifies our values: we place no burden on our customers, instead providing what we believe to be the most cost-effective solution to their basic needs; and then delivering within this platform the ability for them to move to higher-level needs and capabilities, when they want, when they are ready and when they will realize economic and experience benefits.
 Leveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we are developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases.  The next major opportunity in our connected world is the IoT, which fundamentally is about physical things.  We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market. 
 Market Strategy
 Our strategy is to drive growth by leveraging our core technology expertise delivered as the industry’s most complete single-vendor solution.  We deliver current-architecture solutions to our mainstream customers, while providing cutting-edge capabilities to our early adopter customer.  The result is a long term, trusted partnership with enduring customer relationships and therefore a high lifetime value with our customers.
 We build on our experience addressing solutions across multiple markets, including government, transportation, healthcare, education, banking, retail, critical infrastructure and others.  Our common advantages across all of our segments, in addition to a shared set of technologies and supply chain, is our more than 30 years of expertise and sustained reputation as the go-to source for what we believe to be the top-quality, most reliable, most cost-effective solution.  We drive an intense commitment to our customers, to ensure we are delivering business-supporting solutions to them and honoring a straightforward, respectful, trustworthy and business-based relationship at all times, and for a long time.  In each of our segments we have a long track-record within the industry, and this positions us as a trusted advisor, supplier and business partner.
 In our Premises segment, we believe that our more than 30 years’ experience delivering physical security solutions to U.S. Government customers has provided us with significant expertise and a quality reputation.  Our products enable compliance with federal directives and standards implemented over the past decade, including Homeland Security Presidential Directive (“HSPD”) 12 and FIPS 201, which defines a common standard known as the PIV credential, used by all U.S. Government employees and contractors. We are a leading supplier of physical access control solutions to both federal and state government customers, including agencies within the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, the FBI, U.S. Marshall and many others.  As a pioneering adopter of physical security technologies and protocols employed on a large scale, the U.S. Government continues to demand the best of breed, which we have been delivering to an increasing range of agencies and departments.
 Since the acquisition of 3VR, our video intelligence solutions provide a single platform for real-time security and customer insights, enabling organizations to protect employees, customers and assets as well as improve store operations and shopping experiences. Our new open, pluggable platform leverages existing customer infrastructure and allows customers to expand their systems’ capabilities seamlessly.
 We develop and sell integrated physical security solutions to government and enterprise customers worldwide. Our systems integrate access control, video surveillance and analytics, intrusion detection, building management and other network-based systems using a wide range of access cards, including PIV cards, smart cards, RFID cards and biometrics in order to successfully secure facilities and resources.
 Physical Security and Analytics
 Our analytics platform is core to our overall strategy. Security technologies are generating vast amounts of real-time data, which in practice has often been unmanageable. That has meant a limited capability to show risks in advance, and that manual processing of vast amounts of data has relegated responses to post-facto, forensic uses. Even those uses have been limited because of the scale of the security data and the limitations of the existing platforms to effectively manage and turn it into useful, actionable information.
 Our systems solve these problems for specific security applications, retail loss prevention, ATM fraud, loitering and other security risks.  The same analytics are being used to turn this security data into business improvement applications.  Since the infrastructure investment has been made for security purposes, costs for incremental systems to apply the data can be limited.  We are doing this in such applications as queue line management, heat mapping, customer service, personnel training and other areas, which we believe will expand both within vertical applications and horizontally.

Since virtually all access control customers deploy video security, we believe the opportunity for a combined product with robust feature sets represents a substantial portion of the overall market, and makes the system more effective. Access control systems manage the most critical event in a security system:  Access granted or access denied.  Access control systems are based on rigorous identification of trusted people within an organization or a community.  This provides the two critical ingredients for successful video security:  A list of already-trusted people, as well as alarms and events to focus video attention and analytics where they are most relevant. Without this leverage, video is a massive data stream that is often unmanageable in real-time and cumbersome to sort through forensically.
 As the market understands this need, some of the most progressive video companies have developed their own access control systems.  And vice versa, some access control companies have developed video capabilities. We believe this approach of extending from one solution to the other has resulted in solutions with limited capabilities. 
 By combining access control and video security solutions, which developed and competed successfully as standalone products in each market, we believe we are establishing a comprehensive solution for our customers. First, our 3VR platform has been architected from the beginning as an analytics and forensics platform, not just as a video streaming and viewing system.  Second, by deeply combining access authorization databases and events with video insights and events, a much narrower solution set is created, since authorized events and people are pre-known, and the remaining events are much easier to tag and respond to as possible security issues. 
 In addition to our core products, we have a range of product initiatives, partnerships and integrations designed to leverage leading technology advances across mobile, biometric, machine-learning and other areas, to provide convenient, frictionless, low-cost yet highly secure physical access.   We invest independently and in partnership with other leading technology companies in these emerging aspects of physical security and analytics platforms. 
 Connecting the Complete Benefits of a Digitized Physical World: Secure Logical Access, Mobility and RFID
 In addition to providing secure and frictionless premises solutions, in our Identity segment, we provide a broad range of smart card readers, tokens and terminals that enable security applications, including national ID cards, payment and eHealth and eGovernment. We have supplied millions of smart card readers to the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. Our mobile applications and readers allow users to securely authenticate on iOS™ or Android™ devices, using their CAC or PIV credentials. Through the acquisition of Thursby, we envision a growing number of government employees, military service personnel and commercial users with a complete and convenient BYOD secure mobile information access solution. 
 We also design and manufacture a broad range of NFC and RFID products across HF and UHF technologies, and from secure transactional devices to high-end microprocessor-based devices.  We have expanded our solutions by incorporating advanced flexible, rechargeable battery technology to bring active-device capabilities to the Cold Chain market and opening the potential of active sensor-enabled applications. Our products are used in diverse applications, including electronic entertainment, loyalty schemes, mobile payment, transit and event ticketing, and others.
 We believe that the know-how across RFID, NFC as well as smart card technology positions us to be the go-to provider for RFID and mobile applications utilizing NFC, HF, or UHF technology. We believe the capabilities we are developing in our engineering and research center in Germany provides a differentiator particularly in the advanced, microprocessor-enabled applications that are key to bringing digital benefits to physical things. Brand authenticity, counterfeiting and consumer engagement applications especially demand compliance with a high level of technical requirements as well as specific expectations around the appearance of the product, user experience and reliability. We believe our ability to provide high-quality pilot projects in small batches with rapid turnaround provides a substantial competitive advantage. 
 Positioned for Growth in Growing Markets
 Leveraging our RFID, NFC and mobility expertise, we are bringing the benefits of the IoT to a wide range of physical, connected items.  Market analysts estimate that by 2020 the number of physical things connected to the Internet will grow into the tens of billions. These will include household appliances, vehicles, medicines, home security systems, books, luggage, jewelry, toys and a host of other objects. We believe the growth of the IoT creates significant opportunities to provide physical access, authentication and identity into nearly every industry, worldwide.  We are leveraging our physical access, video and analytics solutions as well as our RFID-based physical device-management expertise to provide leading solutions as our customers, and our customers’ customers, embrace the IoT.

Customers 
 We sell to customers worldwide in a range of markets, including government, enterprise, consumer, financial services, healthcare and transportation. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 28% of total net revenue in 2018 and 33% of total net revenue in 2017. A significant amount of revenue is sourced from sales of products and systems to our OEM partners and an indirect sales network who sell to various entities within the U.S. federal government sector. U.S. federal government sales are primarily delivered through our OEM partners and an indirect sales network or are priced using published General Service Administration schedules. 
Sales and Marketing
 We primarily conduct our own sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or OEMs. We sell our smart card readers and RFID/NFC products directly to end users and utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales. We sell our physical access control solutions and access card services primarily through systems integrators, dealers and value added partners, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in trade shows and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs. 
Competition
 The market for security solutions is competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards in the industry as a whole and within specific markets. We believe that competition for security solutions is likely to intensify as a result of an ongoing increase in demand for solutions that help converge physical and logical access control systems and RFID and NFC products to enable expansion of the connected world.  The increase in competition will come from two additional factors. First, the vast growth of data being generated by high bandwidth security devices, especially video, as well as the increasing number of electronic-access doors.  As data volumes become increasingly unmanageable with classic systems relying on monitoring by guards, real-time analytics and purpose-built forensic platforms will deliver these critical security results.  Second, technically advanced hardware is moving into commercial markets, driven by volume cost curves as disruptive consumer and small and medium business focused startups launch commercial-scale capabilities into these high volume markets.
 We believe we mitigate competitive risks with several strategies: 
  
• | Providing more complete solutions than many of our physical security competitors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focusing on microprocessor-enabled applications of RFID technology further enhanced by our close partnerships with the major RFID microprocessor vendors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our network of partnerships and integrations;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Our broad IP base, including approximately 50 patents granted or pending;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A trusted relationship with our customers, including a product range that permits us to build business around their preferred adoption rate, whether slow or fast. We believe many of our competitors do not proactively facilitate customers’ progression to newer technologies, while other competitors seek to drive customers to abandon installed systems and leap to new platforms. We support our customers, with our own solutions, throughout this spectrum. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Competition for our smart card readers primarily comes from Gemalto NV and OMNIKEY/HID Global (a division of ASSA ABLOY AB), as well as from a number of smaller suppliers in Asia. Competition for our RFID products comes from a small number of competitors including SMARTRAC NV and a number of inlay conversion companies in Asia. 
 Access control and video solutions are available from multiple suppliers in a very fragmented market, where the top 7 providers represent under a third of the market. We primarily compete with Lenel Systems International, Software House, Gallagher Group Ltd., Honeywell International Inc., Exacq, Genetec and Milestone Systems. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products, systems and solutions include: 
  
• | technical features;
--+--------------------


• | the ability of channel partners to effectively integrate multiple products and systems in order to address customer requirements including full system capabilities, cost of ownership and ease of use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------


• | price and total cost of system ownership.
--+------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably within our market environment, our ability to continue to successfully compete is subject to a variety of factors, as further discussed below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Backlog 
 We typically do not maintain a significant level of backlog and revenue in any quarter significantly depends on contracts entered into or orders received and shipped in that quarter. The majority of our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. While our customer contracts generally do not require fixed long-term purchase commitments, from time to time we do enter into customer contracts where delivery of products, systems or services is ongoing or is scheduled over multiple quarters or years. In view of our order and shipment patterns, and because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, we do not believe that the ongoing arrangements we enter into provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Research and Development
 We have made and continue to make significant investments in research and development. Research and development expenses were $7.2 million in 2018 and $6.1 million in 2017. We capitalized payroll related expenses related to development of our card issuance services of approximately $29,000 and $209,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we capitalized $401,000 of software development costs in 2017 for costs incurred subsequent to a product achieving technological feasibility and prior to the product’s general release to customers. No software development costs were capitalized in 2018. 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property 
 One of our core advantages is our proprietary technology. We currently rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Although we may seek to protect our proprietary technology through patents, it is possible that no new patents will be issued, that our proprietary products or technologies are not patentable, and that any issued patent will fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. The core of our proprietary technology advantage is the combination of our advanced technical expertise combined with our intimate customer knowledge, enabling us to develop bring to market and sometimes patent products uniquely positioned to deliver benefits to customers.  This is an intellectual property advantage characterized both by trade secrets and unique relationships as well as formal patents.
 We have a portfolio of approximately 30 patent families (designs, patents, utility models, patents pending and exclusive licenses) in individual or regional filings, covering products, electrical and mechanical designs, software systems and methods and manufacturing process ideas for our various businesses. Our issued patents expire between 2023 and 2038. We also submitted and have pending U.S. and foreign patent filings in RFID tags, converged access readers and systems, smart card manufacturing methods, authentication and NFC offerings. Additionally, we leverage our own ASIC designs for smart card interface in some of our reader devices. 
 Manufacturing and Sources of Supply
 We utilize a combination of our own manufacturing facilities and the services of contract manufacturers in various countries around the world to manufacture our products and components. Our physical access keypads, controllers and software are manufactured primarily in California, using locally sourced components. Our video appliances are manufactured primarily in Wisconsin and Arizona. The majority of our smart card reader products and components are manufactured in Singapore, Cambodia and South Korea. Our RFID and NFC inlays and inlay-based products such as labels and tags are predominantly manufactured and assembled by our own internal manufacturing teams in Singapore primarily using locally sourced components and are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 quality manufacturing standard.
 9

We have implemented formal quality control programs to satisfy customer requirements for high quality and reliable products. To ensure that products manufactured by third parties are consistent with internal standards, our quality control programs include management of all key aspects of the production process, including establishing product specifications, selecting the components to be used to produce products, selecting the suppliers of these components and negotiating the prices for certain of these components. In addition, we may work with suppliers to improve process control and product design.
 For the majority of our product manufacturing, we utilize a global sourcing strategy that serves all business solution areas within the company, which allows us to achieve economies of scale and uniform quality standards for our products and support higher gross margins.
 On an ongoing basis, we analyze the need to add alternative sources for both our products and components. For example, we currently utilize the foundry services of external suppliers to produce our ASICs for smart cards readers and inlays, and we use chips and antenna components from third-party suppliers in our RFID and NFC inlays and contactless smart card readers. Wherever possible, we have qualified additional sources of supply for components. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 273 employees, of which 71 were in research and development, 86 were in sales and marketing, 34 were in general and administrative and 82 were in manufacturing and related functions. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and, to our knowledge, none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union. To date, we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are generally good. 
Corporate Information 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Fremont, California.  We maintain research and development facilities in California and Texas; Chennai, India; Munich, Germany; and local operations and sales facilities in Germany, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and the United States.  We were founded in 1990 in Munich, Germany and incorporated in 1996 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Legal Proceedings 
 On January 1, 2016, certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants, and we were named as nominal defendant, in a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Oswald v. Humphreys, et al., Case No. 16-cv-00241-CRB, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and waste claims.  On January 25, 2016, certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants, and we were named as nominal defendant, in a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, entitled Chopra v. Hart, et al., Case No. RG16801379, alleging breach of fiduciary duty claims.  On February 9, 2016, certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants, and we were named as nominal defendant, in a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, entitled Wollnik v. Wenzel, et al., Case No. HG16803342, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, gross mismanagement, and unjust enrichment claims.  These lawsuits generally allege that we made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information in certain public filings and disclosures between 2013 and 2015.  Each of the lawsuits seeks one or more of the following remedies: unspecified compensatory damages, unspecified exemplary or punitive damages, restitution, declaratory relief, equitable and injunctive relief, and reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.  On May 2, 2016, the court in the Chopra lawsuit entered an order staying proceedings in the Chopra lawsuit in favor of the Oswald lawsuit, based on a stipulation to that effect filed by the parties in the Chopra lawsuit on April 28, 2016.  Similarly, on June 28, 2016, the court in the Wollnik lawsuit entered a stipulated order staying proceedings in the Wollnik lawsuit in favor of the Oswald lawsuit.  On June 17, 2016, the plaintiff in the Oswald lawsuit filed an amended complaint.  On August 1, 2016, we filed a motion to dismiss for failure by plaintiff to make a pre-lawsuit demand on our board of directors, which motion was heard on October 14, 2016. The judge in the Oswald lawsuit issued an order on November 7, 2016 granting our motion to dismiss, without prejudice.  In addition, the court stayed the case so that plaintiff could exercise whatever rights he had under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  On or around November 30, 2016, the plaintiff purported to serve a books and records demand under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  We responded to that demand. On March 21, 2017, we and the plaintiff in the Oswald lawsuit filed a stipulation and proposed order lifting the stay of the case, granting the plaintiff leave to amend, and setting a briefing schedule.  The plaintiff in the Oswald lawsuit filed his second amended complaint on April 10, 2017. We then filed a motion to dismiss that second amended complaint on May 12, 2017.  After further briefing and argument, on October 22, 2017, the court issued its written order denying the motion to dismiss on the basis of demand futility.  On January 3, 2018, the court entered a stipulated order setting a response and briefing schedule for defendants to the second amended complaint.

Defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint in the Oswald action under Rule 12(b)(6) on January 16, 2018.  After further briefing and argument, on April 13, 2018, the court entered an order granting defendants’ motions to dismiss.  On April 19, 2018, Plaintiff Oswald filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  On that same date, Plaintiff Chopra, a plaintiff in a related and stayed derivative action in state court, filed a motion to intervene in the Oswald action.  After further briefing and argument, on July 16, 2018, the court entered an order granting the Chopra motion to intervene and denying the Oswald motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  After the filing of an unopposed administrative motion for entry of judgment by defendants, on October 1, 2018, the court entered an order granting administrative motion for entry of final judgment and entered final judgment in favor of all named defendants and against plaintiffs Oswald and Chopra.  On October 23, 2018, plaintiff Oswald filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit.  Oswald’s opening appellate brief was filed on March 4, 2019.  In the interim, the state court Chopra and Wollnik actions have remained stayed with periodic status conferences.  The next status conferences have been scheduled in the Chopra and Wollnik cases on November 5, 2019 before Judge Seligman. We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.  We cannot currently predict the impact or resolution of each of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any, which could be material, and the resolution of these lawsuits may harm our business and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
 From time to time, we could become subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business or could be named a defendant in additional lawsuits. The outcome of such claims or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
