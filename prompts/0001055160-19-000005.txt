Item 1.  Business.
GENERAL

We are an internally-managed real estate investment trust (or REIT) primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in residential mortgage assets. Our investments include principally the following;

• | Residential mortgage securities including Non-Agency MBS, Agency MBS and CRT securities;


• | Residential whole loans, including purchased performing loans, purchased credit impaired and non-performing loans; and


• | MSR-related assets, which include term notes backed directly or indirectly by MSRs and loans to provide financing to entities that originate residential mortgage loans and own the related MSRs.

Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.

We were incorporated in Maryland on July 24, 1997 and began operations on April 10, 1998.  We have elected to be a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must comply with a number of requirements under federal tax law, including that we must distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary (or TRS). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that a REIT or qualified REIT subsidiary (or QRS) may not hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business.
We are a holding company and conduct our real estate finance businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, so as to maintain an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (or the Investment Company Act) by ensuring that less than 40% of the value of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items (which we refer to as our adjusted total assets for Investment Company Act purposes), on an unconsolidated basis, consist of “investment securities” as defined by the Investment Company Act. We refer to this test as the “40% Test.” 

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We primarily invest, through our various subsidiaries, in residential mortgage assets. We continue to acquire residential mortgage securities and such investments comprised more than 50% of our total assets at the end of 2018. In recent years we have substantially increased investments in residential whole loans, as proceeds received from portfolio run-off from Agency and Non-Agency MBS and equity capital raised in the market have been deployed primarily in loan investments. Consequently, at the end of 2018, residential whole loan investments comprised approximately 38% of our assets and more than 50% of our allocated net equity. During 2019, we expect to continue to seek investment opportunities primarily in residential whole loans and selectively in residential mortgage securities and MSR-related assets as market opportunities arise. We expect that we will moderately increase leverage to support further asset growth in 2019, both through use of repurchase agreement financing and securitization. 
Residential Whole Loans

During 2018, we continued to grow our residential whole loan portfolio, which we acquired through interests in certain trusts established to acquire the loans, that are consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes. In particular during 2018, growth in our residential whole loan portfolio was primarily through acquisitions or commitments to acquire purchased performing loans. Such loans include: (i) loans to finance (or refinance) one-to four-family residential properties that are not considered to meet the definition of a “Qualified Mortgage” in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or Non-QM loans), (ii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by residential properties made to non-occupant borrowers who intend to rehabilitate and sell the property for a profit (or Rehabilitation loans or Fix and Flip loans), (iii) loans to finance (or refinance) non-owner occupied one-to four-family residential properties that are rented to one or more tenants (or Single-family rental loans), and (iv) previously originated loans secured by residential real estate that is generally owner occupied (or Seasoned performing loans). The majority of our purchased performing loans are Hybrids or, in the case of Rehabilitation loans, are expected to have relatively short duration. Consequently, we believe that our purchased performing loans acquired to date will exhibit relatively lower interest rate sensitivity than conventional fixed rate residential whole loans.

In addition, during 2018, we continued to purchase packages of both purchased credit impaired and non-performing residential whole loans which were acquired in secondary market transactions. Purchased credit impaired loans are typically characterized by borrowers who have previously experienced payment delinquencies and the amount owed may exceed the value of the property pledged as collateral. The majority of these loans are purchased at purchase prices that are discounted (often substantially so) to their contractual loan balance to reflect the impaired credit history of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio (or LTV) of the loan and the coupon rate. Non-performing loans are typically characterized by borrowers who have defaulted on their obligations and/or have payment delinquencies of 60 days or more at the time we acquire the loan. The majority of these loans are also purchased at purchase prices that are discounted (often substantially so) to the contractual loan balance that reflects primarily the non-performing nature of the loan. Typically, this purchase price is a discount to the expected value of the collateral securing the loan, such value to be realized after foreclosure and liquidation of the property. The majority of these residential whole loans were purchased on a servicing-released basis (i.e., the sellers of such loans transferred the right to service the loans as part of the sale). Because we do not directly service any loans, we have contracted with loan servicing companies with specific expertise in working with delinquent borrowers in an effort to cure delinquencies through, among other things, loan modification and third-party refinancing. To the extent these efforts are successful, we believe our investments in residential whole loans will yield attractive returns. In addition, to the extent that it is not possible to achieve a successful outcome for a particular borrower and the real property collateral must be foreclosed on and liquidated, we believe that the discounted purchase price at which the asset was acquired provides us with a level of protection against financial loss. Given the increase in the size of our residential whole loan investments and our ongoing focus on this asset class, we expect balances of “real estate owned” (or REO) property to increase.
Residential Mortgage Securities
Our Legacy Non-Agency MBS have been acquired primarily at discounts to face/par value, which we believe serves to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.  A portion of the purchase discount on substantially all of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS is designated as a non-accretable purchase discount (also referred to hereafter as Credit Reserve), which effectively mitigates our risk of loss on the mortgages collateralizing such MBS and is not expected to be accreted into interest income.  The portion of the purchase discount that is designated as accretable discount is accreted into interest income over the life of the security.  The mortgages collateralizing our Legacy Non-Agency MBS consist primarily of ARMs, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and Hybrids. Legacy Non-Agency ARMs and Hybrids typically exhibit reduced interest rate sensitivity (as compared to fixed-rate Legacy Non-Agency MBS) due to their interest rate adjustments (similar to Agency ARMs and Hybrids). However, yields on Legacy Non-Agency MBS, unlike Agency MBS, also exhibit sensitivity to changes in credit performance.  If credit performance improves, the Credit Reserve may be decreased (and accretable discount increased), resulting in a higher yield over the remaining life of the security. Similarly, deteriorating credit performance could increase the Credit Reserve and decrease the yield over the remaining life of the security, or other-than-temporary impairment could result. To the extent that higher interest rates in the future are indicative of an improving economy, better employment data and/or higher home prices, it is possible that these factors will improve the credit performance of Legacy Non-Agency MBS and therefore mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of these securities. Due to their strong performance over the past several years, and resulting increased demand for these investments, returns available on Legacy Non-Agency MBS have been lower than for other residential mortgage assets. Consequently, in recent years we have managed this portfolio through opportunistic sales of certain Legacy Non-Agency MBS based on an assessment of expected future cash flows and prevailing market pricing.
Our RPL/NPL MBS were purchased primarily at prices around par and represent the senior and mezzanine tranches of the related securitizations. These securities are structured with significant credit enhancement (typically approximately 40-50% for the most senior tranches and approximately 25-35% for mezzanine tranches) and the subordinate tranches absorb all credit losses (until those tranches are extinguished) and typically receive no cash flow (interest or principal) until the senior tranches are paid off. Prior to purchase, we analyze the deal structure and the credit risk of the underlying loans. Subsequent to purchase, the ongoing credit risk associated with the deal is evaluated by analyzing the extent to which actual credit losses occur that result in a reduction in the amount of subordination supporting our bond. Based on the recent performance of the collateral underlying our RPL/NPL MBS and current subordination levels, we do not believe that we are currently exposed to significant risk of credit loss on these investments. In addition, the structures of these investments generally contain a contractual coupon step-up feature, where the coupon increases up to 300 - 400 basis points at 36 - 48 months or sooner. We expect that the combination of the priority cash flow and the step-up feature associated with these investments will result in their exhibiting short average lives and, accordingly, reduced interest rate sensitivity. 
The mortgages collateralizing our Agency MBS portfolio are predominantly Hybrids, 15 and 30 year fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs.  Our Agency MBS were selected to generate attractive returns relative to interest rate and prepayment risks. The Hybrid loans collateralizing our MBS typically have initial fixed-rate periods at origination of three, five, seven or ten years.  At the end of this fixed-rate period, these mortgages become adjustable and their interest rates adjust based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (or LIBOR) or in some cases the one-year constant maturity treasury rate (or CMT). These interest rate adjustments are typically limited by periodic caps (which limit the amount of the interest rate change from the prior rate) and lifetime caps

(which are maximum interest rates permitted for the life of the mortgage). As coupons earned on Agency Hybrids and ARMs adjust over time as interest rates change, the fair values of these assets are generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than are fixed-rate MBS. In general, Hybrid loans and ARMs have 30-year final maturities and they amortize over this 30-year period. While the coupons on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages do not adjust, they amortize according to a 15-year amortization schedule and have a 15-year final maturity. Due to their accelerated amortization and shorter final maturity, these assets are generally less sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages with a longer final maturity, such as 30-year mortgages. During 2018, as we have for the past several years, we allowed our Hybrid and 15-year Agency MBS to run off. We also sold approximately $122 million of lower yielding 15-year Agency MBS during the year. In addition, we purchased 30-year Agency MBS and concurrently entered into interest rate swap hedges that are intended to reduce associated interest rate sensitivity. 
For the past several years, we have also invested in CRT securities. CRT securities are debt obligations issued by or sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The payments of principal and interest on the CRT securities are paid on a monthly basis and are dependent on the performance of loans in either a reference pool or an actual pool of loans. We may incur a principal loss if the performance of the underlying actual or reference pool loans results either in calculated or actual losses that exceed the credit enhancement on the underlying CRT security owned by us. We assess the credit risk associated with CRT securities by assessing the current and expected future performance of the associated loan pool. During 2018, we have taken advantage of market opportunities to rotate out of seasoned higher dollar priced securities, resulting in realized gains, and reinvested the sales proceeds in newer issue securities at prices close to par.
MSR-Related Assets
Although we do not own or otherwise invest directly in MSRs, we have made investments in term notes backed directly or indirectly by MSRs and loans to finance entities that originate residential mortgage loans and own the related MSRs. In the case of term notes backed by MSR-related collateral, we believe the credit risk on these investments is mitigated by structural credit support in the form of over-collateralization as well as a corporate guarantee from the ultimate parent or sponsor of the related special purpose vehicle issuing the note, that is intended to provide for payment of interest and principal to the holders of the investments should cash flows generated by the underlying MSRs be insufficient. Credit risk on MSR-related corporate loans is mitigated as the loans are secured by MSRs and certain other unencumbered assets owned by the borrower.
FINANCING STRATEGY

Our financing strategy is designed to increase the size of our investment portfolio by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of the assets in our portfolio.  We primarily use repurchase agreements to finance our holdings of residential mortgage assets.  We enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our repurchase agreement borrowings.  We have also securitized both re-performing and non-performing residential whole loans as part of our financing strategy. Going forward, in connection with our current and any future investment in residential whole loans, our financing strategy may include the use of additional loan securitization transactions or the use of other forms of structured financing. 

Repurchase agreements, although legally structured as sale and repurchase transactions, are financing contracts (i.e., borrowings) under which we pledge our residential mortgage assets as collateral to secure loans with repurchase agreement counterparties (i.e., lenders).  Repurchase agreements involve the transfer of the pledged collateral to a lender at an agreed upon price in exchange for such lender’s simultaneous agreement to return the same asset back to the borrower at a future date (i.e., the maturity of the borrowing) at a price that is higher than the original sales price.  The difference between the sale price that we receive and the repurchase price that we pay represents interest paid to the lender.  Our cost of borrowings under repurchase agreements is generally LIBOR based.  Under our repurchase agreements, we pledge our assets as collateral to secure the borrowing, in an amount equal to a specified percentage of the fair value of the pledged collateral, while we retain beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral.  At the maturity of a repurchase financing, unless the repurchase financing is renewed with the same counterparty, we are required to repay the loan including any accrued interest and concurrently receive back our pledged collateral from the lender. With the consent of the lender, we may renew a repurchase financing at the then prevailing financing terms.  Margin calls, whereby a lender requires that we pledge additional assets or cash as collateral to secure borrowings under our repurchase financing with such lender, are routinely experienced by us when the value of the assets pledged as collateral declines as a result of principal amortization and prepayments or due to changes in market interest rates, spreads or other market conditions.  We also may make margin calls on counterparties when collateral values increase.

In order to reduce our exposure to counterparty-related risk, we generally seek to enter into repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements, and derivatives, with a diversified group of financial institutions.  At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding balances under repurchase agreements with 26 separate lenders.

In addition to repurchase agreements, we may also use other sources of funding in the future to finance our residential mortgage assets, including, but not limited to, other types of collateralized borrowings, loan agreements, lines of credit or the issuance of debt and/or equity securities.
COMPETITION
We believe that our principal competitors in the business of acquiring and holding residential mortgage assets of the types in which we invest are financial institutions, such as banks, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, institutional investors, including mutual funds and pension funds, hedge funds and other mortgage REITs, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve (or Federal Reserve) as part of its monetary policy activities.  Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints (i.e., REIT compliance or maintaining an exemption under the Investment Company Act) as we are.  In addition, many of these entities have greater financial resources and access to capital than we have.  The existence of these entities, as well as the possibility of additional entities forming in the future, may increase the competition for the acquisition of residential mortgage assets, resulting in higher prices and lower yields on such assets.
EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2018, we had 59 full-time and one part-time employee.  We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.  None of our employees are unionized or represented under a collective bargaining agreement.
