Overview
iStar Inc. (references to the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" refer to iStar Inc.) finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. The Company also manages entities focused on ground lease ("Ground Lease") and net lease investments. The Company has invested approximately $40 billion over the past two decades and is structured as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. The Company's primary reportable business segments are real estate finance, net lease, operating properties and land and development.

As of December 31, 2018, based on our gross book value, including the carrying value of our equity method investments exclusive of accumulated depreciation, our total investment portfolio has the following characteristics:
Real Estate Finance: The real estate finance portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that may be either fixed-rate or variable-rate and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. The Company's portfolio also includes leasehold loans, preferred equity investments and senior and subordinated loans to business entities and may be either secured or unsecured. The Company's loan portfolio includes whole loans and loan participations.
Net Lease: The net lease portfolio includes the Company's net lease and Ground Lease investment strategies, both of which offer stable long-term cash flows. We own net lease properties directly and through ventures that we manage. We operate our Ground Lease investment strategy primarily through Safety, Income & Growth Inc. ("SAFE"), a publicly traded REIT focused exclusively on Ground Leases that we launched in 2017 and manage pursuant to a management agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 41.8% of SAFE's outstanding common stock. On January 2, 2019, we made an additional significant, direct equity investment in SAFE (refer to "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Our Portfolio"). After giving effect to the additional investment, we hold approximately 65.5% of SAFE's fully diluted equity. We also directly participate in Ground Leases by offering leasehold loans to SAFE's tenants.
Operating Properties: The operating properties portfolio is comprised of commercial and residential properties, which represent a pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and property types. The Company generally seeks to reposition or redevelop its transitional properties with the objective of maximizing their value through the infusion of capital and/or concentrated asset management efforts. The commercial properties within this portfolio include office, retail, hotel and other property types. The residential properties within this portfolio are generally luxury condominium projects located in major U.S. cities where the Company's strategy is to sell individual condominium units through retail distribution channels. 
Land & Development: The land and development portfolio is primarily comprised of land entitled for master planned communities and waterfront and urban infill land parcels located throughout the United States. Master planned communities represent large-scale residential projects that the Company will entitle, plan and/or develop and may sell through retail channels to homebuilders or in bulk ("MPCs"). The communities also typically have a smaller portion of their land reserved for future commercial development. Waterfront parcels are generally entitled for residential projects and urban infill parcels are generally entitled for mixed-use projects. The Company may develop these properties itself, or in partnership with commercial real estate developers, or may sell the properties.

The Company's primary sources of revenues are operating lease income, which is comprised of the rent and reimbursements that tenants pay to lease the Company's properties, interest income, which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans, and land development revenue from lot and parcel sales. The Company primarily generates income through a “spread” or “margin,” which is the difference between the revenues net of property related expenses generated from leases and loans and interest expense. In addition, the Company generates income from sales of its real estate and income from equity in earnings of its unconsolidated ventures. 
Investment Strategy 
Throughout our more than 20-year history, we have focused on providing capital to the commercial real estate sector in a differentiated way that emphasizes custom-tailored solutions over commoditized products. We have adjusted the allocation of our capital and resources from time to time based on market conditions. Our Ground Lease strategy is the most recent example of our historical approach. We believe that investment and financing opportunities in the Ground Lease sector currently offer more attractive risk adjusted returns than other investment opportunities, and should enable us to benefit from the unique insights and competitive advantages we have gained through the launch of SAFE. 
In originating new investments, the Company's strategy is to focus on the following:

• | Targeting custom-tailored opportunities where customers require flexible financial solutions and "one-call" responsiveness, such as a joint offering of a SAFE Ground Lease and an iStar leasehold loan;


• | Acquiring a fee simple interest in a commercial property that we intend to bifurcate into a SAFE Ground Lease to be acquired by SAFE and a leasehold interest which we may sell or hold for investment;


• | Avoiding commodity businesses where there is significant direct competition from other providers of capital;


• | Developing direct relationships with borrowers and corporate customers in addition to sourcing transactions through intermediaries;


• | Adding value beyond simply providing capital by offering borrowers and corporate customers specific lending expertise, flexibility, certainty of closing and continuing relationships beyond the closing of a particular financing transaction;


• | Taking advantage of market anomalies in the real estate financing markets when, in the Company's view, credit is mispriced by other providers of capital; and


• | Evaluating relative risk adjusted returns across multiple investment markets.

We have been actively seeking to reduce the level of our "legacy assets," which refer primarily to properties that we took back from defaulting borrowers in the financial crisis. In 2018, we reduced that portfolio from 35% of our gross book value to 20%. Under the guidance of a new President of Land and Development hired in 2018, we intend to accelerate the monetization of certain legacy assets, including several larger assets, in order to allow us to focus more capital and resources on new investments, particularly in the Ground Lease business.
Financing Strategy 
The Company uses leverage to enhance its return on assets. Although capital remains cheap and plentiful in the commercial real estate markets, recently interest rates and the equity markets are experiencing greater volatility. We have taken a cautious approach in these conditions. In the fourth quarter 2018, we opportunistically refinanced a net lease asset using non-recourse mortgage debt that generated $115.5 million of proceeds to us, net of closing costs, which were used to redeem at par a portion of our senior notes due July 2019. The July 2019 senior notes maturity was reduced from $770.0 million at the beginning of 2018 to $375.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we called for redemption the remaining $375.0 million principal amount of July 2019 senior notes on the redemption date of March 7, 2019.
Going forward, the Company will seek to raise capital through a variety of means, which may include unsecured and secured debt financing, debt refinancings, asset sales, sales of interests in business lines, issuances of equity, joint ventures and other third party capital arrangements. A more detailed discussion of the Company's current liquidity and capital resources is provided in Item 7—"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Underwriting Process
The Company reviews investment opportunities with its investment professionals, as well as representatives from its legal, credit, risk management and capital markets departments. The Company has developed a process for screening potential investments called the Six Point Methodologysm. Through this proprietary process, the Company internally evaluates an investment opportunity by: (1) evaluating the source of the opportunity; (2) evaluating the quality of the collateral, corporate credit or lessee, as well as the market and industry dynamics; (3) evaluating the borrower equity, corporate sponsorship and/or guarantors; (4) determining the optimal legal and financial structure for the transaction given its risk profile; (5) performing an alternative investment test; and (6) evaluating the liquidity of the investment. The Company intends to use a similar screening methodology for leasehold loans to tenants of SAFE and related party transactions with SAFE. The Company maintains an internal investment committee, and certain investments, including related party transactions and leasehold loans to tenants of SAFE, are subject to the approval of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.
Hedging Strategy
The Company finances its business with a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and its asset base consists of fixed-rate and variable-rate investments. Its variable-rate assets and liabilities are intended to be matched against changes in variable interest rates. This means that as interest rates increase, the Company earns more on its variable-rate lending assets and pays more on its variable-rate debt obligations and, conversely, as interest rates decrease, the Company earns less on its variable-rate lending assets and pays less on its variable-rate debt obligations. When the Company's variable-rate debt obligations differ from its variable-rate lending assets, the Company may utilize derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on its net income. The Company also uses derivative instruments to limit its exposure to changes in currency rates in respect of certain investments denominated in foreign currencies. The derivative instruments the Company uses are typically in the form of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and foreign exchange contracts.
Policies with Respect to Other Activities
The Company's investment, financing and corporate governance policies (including conflicts of interests policies) are managed under the ultimate supervision of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company can amend, revise or eliminate these policies at any time without a vote of its shareholders. The Company intends to originate and manage investments in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") for the Company to qualify as a REIT.
Investment Restrictions or Limitations
The Company does not have any prescribed allocation among investments or product lines. Instead, the Company focuses on corporate and real estate credit underwriting to develop an analysis of the risk/reward trade-offs in determining the pricing and advisability of each particular transaction.
The Company believes that it is not, and intends to conduct its operations so as not to become, regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act generally exempts entities that are "primarily engaged in purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate" (collectively, "Qualifying Interests"). The Company intends to rely on current interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to qualify for this exemption. Based on these interpretations, the Company, among other things, must maintain at least 55% of its assets in Qualifying Interests and at least 80% of its assets in Qualifying Interests and other "real estate-related assets" (such as mezzanine loans and unsecured investments in real estate entities) combined. The Company's senior mortgages, real estate assets and certain of its subordinated mortgages generally constitute Qualifying Interests. Subject to the limitations on ownership of certain types of assets and the gross income tests imposed by the Code, the Company also may invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
Competition
The Company operates in a competitive market. See Item 1a—Risk factors—"We compete with a variety of financing and leasing sources for our customers," for a discussion of how we may be affected by competition.
Regulation
The operations of the Company are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting activities; (2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; (5) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices; (6) govern privacy of customer information; 
4

and (7) regulate anti-terror and anti-money laundering activities. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. The Company is also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans.
In the judgment of management, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the business conducted by the Company. It is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon the future business, financial condition or results of operations or prospects of the Company.
The Company has elected and expects to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company must generally distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders each year. In addition, the Company must distribute 100% of its net taxable income (including net capital gains) each year to eliminate U.S. corporate federal income taxes payable by it. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT qualification. These requirements include specific share ownership tests and asset and gross income tests. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including, for taxable years prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its net taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to state and local taxes and to U.S. federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income.
Code of Conduct
The Company has adopted a code of conduct that sets forth the principles of conduct and ethics to be followed by our directors, officers and employees (the "Code of Conduct"). The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in periodic reports, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct and a culture of honesty and accountability. A copy of the Code of Conduct has been provided to each of our directors, officers and employees, who are required to acknowledge that they have received and will comply with the Code of Conduct.
