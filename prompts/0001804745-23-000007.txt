Item 1. Business
Overview
Driven Brands is the largest automotive services company in North America with a growing and highly-franchised base of more than 4,800 locations across 49 U.S. states and 13 other countries. Our scaled, diversified platform provides high-quality services to an extensive range of consumer and commercial customers who rely on their automobiles in all economic environments to get to work and in many other aspects of their daily lives. Our breadth of services cover a wide variety of automotive needs, including paint, collision, glass, and repair services, as well as a variety of high-frequency services, such as oil changes and car washes. We have generated consistent recurring revenue and strong operating margins, with limited maintenance capital expenditures. Our network generated approximately $2.0 billion in revenue from approximately $5.6 billion in system-wide sales in 2022. 
The Company operates and reports financial information on a 52 or 53 week year with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Our 2022 fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 consisted of 53 weeks and our 2021 and 2020 fiscal years ending December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, consisted of 52 weeks.
We are the largest provider of diversified automotive services in North America and have a portfolio of well known brands, including CARSTAR®, IMO®, MAACO® (“Maaco”), Meineke Car Care Centers® (“Meineke”), PH Vitres D’Autos® (“PH”), Take 5 Oil Change® (“Take 5 Oil”), Take 5 Car Wash®, Auto Glass Now® (“AGN”), Fix Auto USA® (“Fix Auto”), and 1-800-Radiator & A/C® (“1-800 Radiator”), among others. Building from a 50 year history in the category with some of the most recognizable brands in the industry, our diversified platform caters to almost any automotive service occasion. 
The network benefits of bringing these offerings together on the Driven Brands platform are tangible. Leveraging our scale and combined resources, we have invested heavily in the creation of unique and powerful shared services, which we believe provide each brand with more resources and produce better results than any individual brand could achieve on its own. Our locations are strengthened by ongoing training initiatives, targeted marketing enhancements, procurement savings, and cost efficiencies, driving revenue and profitability growth for both Driven Brands and for our franchisees. Our performance is further enhanced by a data analytics engine, which has gathered data points from approximately 30 million unique customers.
Our Core Competencies
Driven Brands has a long track record of delivering strong growth and market share gain through same store sales performance, organic store count growth, and acquisitions utilizing our proven playbook for growth. We believe our diversified platform is uniquely capable of offering a compelling and convenient service proposition to our customers by providing a wide breadth of services for all vehicle types and across multiple service categories including paint, collision, glass, repair, oil change, maintenance, and car wash. 
The execution of organic real estate development and successful mergers and acquisitions is a core competency and an important shared service capability across the Driven Brands platform. We have invested in and built out a dedicated team, and supporting infrastructure to support organic development, including market planning, site selection, engineering and construction, and store openings. Similarly, we have also invested in our mergers and acquisitions team and infrastructure processes to systematically source, perform due diligence on, acquire, and integrate acquired locations. Since 2020, we have accelerated our organic openings and completed more than 100 acquisitions. 
Since entering the Car Wash segment in 2020 through our acquisition of International Car Wash Group (“ICWG”) with over 900 locations across 14 countries, we have significantly expanded our Car Wash footprint in the U.S. by completing tuck-in acquisitions of more than 160 tuck-in locations. Simultaneously, we have continued to invest in our greenfield development pipeline opening 30 locations in 2022 with a pipeline of more than 250 future locations. 
In 2022, our expansion into the U.S. glass market allowed us to add 174 locations along with their mobile presence to further complement our broad offering to both consumer and commercial customers, including our existing insurance 
customers. Similar to Car Wash, we have ramped up our development pipeline, which will be an important focus of the business in addition to tuck-in acquisitions. 
We believe that we remain optimally positioned to continue our long and successful track record of acquisitions, both in our existing service categories, as well as into new, complementary ones, which will provide us with new organic and acquisition growth opportunities in highly fragmented service categories. In addition, the evolving vehicle technology landscape provides numerous opportunities for Driven Brands to leverage its scale and core competencies to continue to expand our market share. 
Our organic growth and acquisition strategy is enhanced by our data analytics engine, which is powered by internally-collected data from consumers, their vehicles, and services that are provided to us at each transaction, and further enriched by third-party data. This powerful data gathering capability holds data from more than 30 million unique customers, which we use throughout our platform for improving our marketing and customer prospecting capabilities, measuring location performance, enhancing store-level operations, and optimizing our real estate site selection. As we grow organically and through acquisitions, we believe the power of our shared services and data analytics will grow and will continue to be a key differentiator for our business.
Our Growth Strategies 
We plan to continue to grow our business by executing on the following strategies: 
Grow Our Brands with New Locations
We have a proven track record of unit growth and believe our competitive strengths provide us with a solid financial and operational foundation that positions us to deliver sustained and predictable store growth. Our ability to grow through a variety of strategies, including organic franchised and company-operated growth as well as M&A, provides us flexibility to deliver against plans.
Our franchise growth is driven both by new store openings as well as through conversions of independent market participants that do not have the benefits of our scaled platform. Our attractive unit economics, national brand recognition, strong insurance and fleet customer relationships, and beneficial shared services capabilities provide highly compelling economic benefits for our franchisees, resulting in a strong desire to join and stay within our network. As of December 31, 2022, we had agreements to open more than 1,200 new franchised units, which provides us with visibility into future franchise unit growth. 
Additionally, we continue to expand our company-operated Take 5 Oil, Take 5 Car Wash, and Auto Glass Now footprint through new greenfield openings as well as tuck-in acquisitions and conversions. The oil change, car wash, and glass repair and replacement markets in North America are highly fragmented, providing significant runway for continued growth. The success of our company-operated locations is supported by our deep data analytics capabilities that use proprietary algorithms and insights to enable optimal site identification and selection. With low net start-up costs and strong sales ramp, company-operated locations provide highly attractive returns, and we believe there is ample whitespace in existing and adjacent markets for continued unit growth.
Continue to Drive Same Store Sales Growth 
We have demonstrated an ability to drive attractive organic growth with positive same store sales performance over 14 of the past 15 years. We believe that we are well positioned to continue benefiting from this momentum by executing on the following growth levers: 
•Continued Commercial Partnership Expansion: We are proactively growing our commercial partnerships and winning new customers by being a highly convenient and cost effective “one-stop-shop” service provider that caters to the extensive suite of automotive service needs for commercial fleet operators and insurance carriers. These customers want to work with nationally scaled and recognized chains with broad geographic coverage, extensive service offerings, strong operating metrics, and centralized billing services. We are dedicated to expanding partnerships with existing commercial customers as well as attracting new national and local customers.
•Continued Growth of Subscription Car Wash Revenue Model: Since acquiring ICWG in 2020, we have expanded our subscription membership program across our U.S. car wash stores to approximately half of domestic car wash revenue in 2022. In addition to fostering strong customer loyalty to our stores, we believe the subscription program also generates predictable and recurring revenue and provides incremental data and customer insights, further strengthening our data analytics capabilities. We believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our subscription program. 
•Leverage Data Analytics to Optimize Marketing, Product Offerings, and Pricing: We have large, dedicated brand marketing funds supported by contributions from our franchisees, and in 2022 we collected and spent approximately $131 million for marketing across our brands. Insights from our data analytics engine enhance our marketing and promotional strategy to drive growth in unit-level performance. For instance, our proprietary data algorithms help optimize lead generation and conversion through personalized, targeted, and timely marketing promotions that provide customers with the optimal offer at the right time. In addition, our data provides insights that are enabling us to identify and roll out new product offerings, improve menu design, and optimize pricing structure across our brands. Use cases like these are regularly tested, refined, and deployed across our network to drive store performance. 
We believe that the benefits we receive from this capability will continue to grow as we leverage our data to capture additional share of wallet from our existing customers in addition to growing our customer base.
Enhance Margins through Procurement Initiatives and Strengthening Platform Services 
In addition to top-line growth, Driven Brands has also been able to leverage the strength of the platform to enhance margins for franchised, independently-operated, and company-operated locations through the following levers: 
•Leverage Shared Services and Platform Scale: We expect to continue to benefit from margin improvements associated with our increasing scale and the growing efficiency of our platform. As a result of the investments we have made, we believe our shared services provide substantial operating leverage and can support a much larger business than we are today. Driven Brands has also been increasing margins through technology advancements to enhance in-store operations and deploy best-practice training initiatives across the portfolio.
•Utilize Purchasing Strength from Procurement Programs: Driven Brands currently provides our network with lower pricing on supplies than it could otherwise achieve independently, thereby augmenting the value proposition to new and existing franchisees and other network members as well as the earnings of our independently-operated and company-operated locations. Our procurement programs provide us with recurring revenue via supplier rebates and product margin. As we continue to grow organically and through acquisition, we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving lower procurement pricing and more benefits to our overall system. 
Segment Information
Our suite of automotive services includes the following segments:
Maintenance
Our Maintenance segment is primarily comprised of the Take 5 Oil and Meineke brands. Our Maintenance brands service a combination of retail and commercial customers, such as fleet operators, through 1,645 total locations as of December 31, 2022. Our maintenance services include oil changes and other regularly scheduled or as-needed automotive services, including vehicle component repair and replacement.
Founded in 1984, Take 5 Oil specializes in providing efficient drive-thru-style oil changes. Take 5 Oil’s 257 franchised and 593 company-operated locations as of December 31, 2022, primarily offer oil changes to retail and commercial customers. We believe Take 5 Oil offers a best-in-class operating model through its convenient drive-thru stay-in-your-car format, simple, focused menu, industry-leading speed of service, and low-pressure sales environment, which is designed to generate strong customer satisfaction, high frequency of use, and attractive unit level economics. Furthermore, Take 5 Oil’s compact store format and unique shallow pit design are intended to reduce upfront build out costs, increase efficiency, and provide real estate flexibility. Take 5 Oil’s franchising efforts are experiencing strong momentum and are expected to continue to drive long-term unit growth through its robust and growing pipeline of franchise commitments. 
Our other maintenance services offered at 795 locations as of December 31, 2022 are 100% franchised and predominantly operate under the Meineke brand. Founded in 1972, Meineke offers an extensive set of total car care services to retail customers and commercial fleet programs, including maintenance, repair, and replacement of components, such as brakes, heating and cooling systems, exhaust, and tires and is known as an automotive services industry pioneer. We believe Meineke is a strong, well-known brand with high brand awareness and customer satisfaction due to its high-quality service, extensive range of service offerings, and the convenience of a nationwide network of locations.
Car Wash
We are the world’s largest conveyor car wash company by location count with 1,111 total locations across North America, Europe, and Australia as of December 31, 2022. Our services primarily consist of express-style exterior car wash services that utilize an automated conveyor belt to pull vehicles along a track where they are machine washed. 
Our car wash services in Europe and Australia are primarily offered through the IMO brand, which has a proud history of over 55-years of providing express-style conveyor car wash services. IMO’s operations appeal to a broad consumer base seeking a low-cost and high-speed car wash at easily-accessible locations. Our 721 international locations as of December 31, 2022 operate an independent operator model, whereby a third-party is responsible for site-level labor and receives commissions based on a percent of site revenue from car washes, resulting in high margins and predictable free cash flow for Driven Brands. 
Since entering the North American market in 2015, we have grown to become the one of the largest domestic operators of conveyor car wash sites with 390 company-operated locations across the United States as of December 31, 2022. We believe that our highly-attractive value proposition, focused on affordability, convenience, and speed of service, resonates with our customers and encourages a high frequency of use in any economic environment. To further strengthen customer loyalty and visit frequency, we also utilize a subscription membership program, which in 2022, accounted for approximately half of our domestic car wash revenue. As one of the few scaled players in the highly fragmented North American market, we believe we are well-positioned for continued unit growth, both through greenfield openings and tuck-in acquisitions. During 2022, we began rebranding our domestic car wash locations to Take 5 Car Wash as a complement to our brand portfolio.
Paint, Collision & Glass
Our Paint, Collision & Glass segment is primarily composed of the CARSTAR, ABRA, Fix Auto, Maaco, Uniban, and AGN brands and serves both retail and commercial customers through 1,846 total locations as of December 31, 2022. Our collision services include full collision repair and refinishing services; our paint services include full body repainting and touch-up, surface preparation and protection, and refinishing and other cosmetic repairs; and our glass services include replacement, repair, and calibration services for automotive glass. 
Our collision repair services are primarily offered through CARSTAR, ABRA, and Fix Auto, which were founded in 1989, 1984, and 1997, respectively, and together comprise the largest franchised collision repair network in North America. Our 1,005 collision locations as of December 31, 2022 are 99% franchised and offer full collision repair and refinishing services in addition to other cosmetic repairs. 
Our paint services are offered through Maaco, which was founded in 1972. Our 417 franchised locations, as of December 31, 2022, offer an extensive suite of services including paint services, surface preparation, protection and refinishing, reconditioning, and other cosmetic external and internal repairs. Maaco primarily serves retail customers and commercial fleet operators and provides strong retail customer service at a much lower average price point than most collision centers, making it an economical option for minor auto body repair when customers prefer to not file a claim.
We operate in the auto glass and replacement industry in Canada through Uniban, which was founded in 1977, and is known as a leader in the category. In 2022, we expanded our offerings to the U.S., primarily through the acquisition of AGN, along with several smaller acquisitions, making us the second-largest glass services business in the U.S. Our 219 franchised and 205 company-operated glass services locations across the U.S. and Canada as of December 31, 2022 primarily offer replacement, repair, and calibration services for automotive glass to retail customers as well as commercial fleet operators and insurance carriers. We also offer technology-enabled glass claims management services for insurance carriers, which drives incremental business to our glass service locations and our distribution business and are complementary to our paint and collision businesses. 
Our Paint, Collision & Glass segment maintains collaborative relationships with the top insurance carriers in the U.S. and Canada, which generate approximately $1.5 billion in Paint, Collision & Glass system wide sales. 
Platform Services
Our Platform Services segment is primarily composed of the 1-800 Radiator, PH, Spire Supply, and Automotive Training Institute (“ATI”) brands. This segment provides significant benefits to our brands by driving organic growth opportunities through procurement, distribution, and training services as well as growth opportunities through acquisition target sourcing. 
Our distribution services are primarily offered through 1-800 Radiator, which was founded in 2001, and is one of the largest franchised distributors in the automotive parts industry. 1-800 Radiator’s 203 locations, as of December 31, 2022, are almost exclusively franchised and distribute a broad, diverse mix of long-tail automotive parts, including radiators, air conditioning components, and exhaust products to automotive repair shops, auto parts stores, body shops, and other auto repair outlets. 1-800 Radiator’s best-in-class operating model is fueled by proprietary algorithmic sourcing technology that enables franchisees to effectively order inventory, manage pricing, and deliver parts to customers within hours. Additionally, 1-800-Radiator’s extensive distribution relationships provide Driven Brands with deep data insights and a large, actionable list of prospective acquisition targets, complementing the attractive free cash flow generation of the business. 
Founded in 1967, PH distributes windshields and glass accessories through a network of distribution centers across Canada and provides direct installation services. PH is the main glass distributor to our company-operated and franchised Uniban locations. In addition, PH is the market leader in the province of Quebec and has a growing presence in Ontario. 
In 2017, we launched Spire Supply, an in-house distributor of consumable products, such as oil filters and wiper blades, which currently serves all Take 5 Oil locations and a portion of our Meineke stores. Spire Supply provides attractive pricing to franchisees relative to other options as well as incremental EBITDA to Driven Brands, by reducing spend that would otherwise be paid to third-party vendors. In addition, Spire Supply simplifies operations for franchisees and company-operated stores by reducing inventory needs and ensuring availability of supplies through automatic replenishment. 
Our financial and operational training services are offered through ATI, a leading provider of training services to repair and maintenance, and paint and collision shops. ATI’s core offering is a multi-year training package that is typically paid for through a monthly subscription. We believe ATI’s leading training program further enhances Driven Brands’ training platform, providing opportunities to improve operational support and increase profitability for both Driven Brands and our franchisees. In addition, ATI’s deep customer database of automotive shops provides us with a pipeline for future franchise development and acquisitions. 
Franchising Strategy 
Our franchising strategy is to grow certain of our brands’ footprints in a capital efficient manner. Our franchise model leverages our proven brand playbooks, the market planning and site selection capabilities of our best-in-class development team, and the local market expertise of highly-motivated owners. Our attractive unit economics, national brand recognition, strong commercial fleet and insurance customer relationships, and beneficial shared service capabilities provide highly compelling economic benefits for our franchisees, resulting in a strong desire to join and stay within our network. As of December 31, 2022, we have agreements to open more than 1,200 new franchised units, which provides us with clear visibility into future franchise unit growth. 
We have a strong track record of opening stores with existing and new franchisees, and we follow strict guidelines in selecting and approving franchisees, who go through extensive interview processes, background checks, and are subject to financial and net-worth-based requirements. 
Franchise Agreements 
For each of our franchisees across our brands, we enter into a franchise agreement covering standard terms and conditions. Under our franchise agreements, we generally grant franchisees the right to operate using our marks and operating system for an initial term (generally 5 to 20 years) with the option to renew their agreements. All proposed new store sites require formal approval from us. Generally, franchisees pay Driven Brands a lump sum initial franchise license fee and ongoing franchise royalties, typically based on a percentage of gross sales. Franchisees of some of our brands also make, or may be required to make, contributions towards marketing funds, typically based on a percentage of gross sales or, in some instances, based on a flat amount or weekly marketing budgets in the applicable designated marketing area. 
Our franchise agreements also require franchisees to comply with our standard operating methods that govern the provision of services and use of vendors and may include a requirement to purchase specified products from us, our affiliates and/or designated vendors. Outside of these standards and policies, we do not control the day-to-day operations, such as hiring and training of employees, of the franchisees. 
We support our franchisees with brand-specific services (e.g., brand marketing, franchise support, and operations) and comprehensive shared services (e.g., centralized marketing support, consumer insights, procurement program savings, commercial fleet, training, development, finance, and technology services). 
Company-Operated Store Strategy 
Our company-operated store strategy involves growing our Take 5 Oil, Take 5 Car Wash, and AGN footprint through a combination of greenfield openings as well as acquiring and converting stores based on our focused market expansion plan. Our best-in-class simple operating model, minimal labor requirements, and low fixed costs drive highly attractive unit-level economics for our company-operated stores. Furthermore, Driven Brands’ acquisition and integration teams have a successful track-record of acquiring independent market participants and chains and converting them to our superior operating model. Our conversion playbook drives cost savings from procurement savings and general and administrative cost synergies as well as consistent revenue growth following the conversion to our model and implementation of our operational improvements and data-driven marketing programs. 
Independent Operator Agreements 
Nearly all of our car wash locations outside of North America operate an independent operator model, where a third party is responsible for site-level labor and receives commissions based on a percentage of site revenue from car washes. At our independently-operated sites, we enter into an independent operator agreement covering the commission paid to the independent operator for our car wash services, terms relating to other services offered by the independent operator at the location from which we do not receive any revenue, and other standard terms and conditions including with respect to protection of confidential information, our intellectual property and customer data, standards relating to sub-contracting, indemnification, and termination. 
Marketing Strategy 
Our marketing strategy highlights the needs-based service offerings and value propositions of each of our brands. We focus our marketing efforts on areas we believe will yield the highest rate of return, including the development of tailored marketing campaigns targeted at specific customers when we know they are in need of one of the services provided by our brands. 
We use a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, our brands and the products and services they offer. Our advertising strategy includes CRM, social and digital media as well as television, print, radio, and sponsorships. We have implemented highly professionalized and data-driven marketing practices and have dedicated brand marketing funds supported by contributions from our franchisees. 
Industry Overview and Competition
We compete with a variety of service providers within the highly-fragmented automotive services and parts distribution market. Competitors include international, national, regional and local repair and maintenance shops, oil change shops, car washes, paint and collision repair shops, glass repair and replacement shops, automobile dealerships, and suppliers of automotive parts, including online retailers, wholesale distributors, hardware stores, and discount and mass market merchandise stores. Given the fragmentation of the industry, our competitors include a limited number of large providers of scale. Typically, our competitors offer services within one of our categories; however, few competitors offer services across multiple categories like Driven Brands. We believe the core competitive factors in our industry are scale, geographic reach, brand awareness, service pricing, speed and quality, and customer satisfaction. 
We compete with other franchisors on the basis of the expected return on investment for franchisees and the value propositions that we offer them. We compete to sell franchises to potential franchisees who may choose to purchase franchises from other automotive aftermarket service providers, or who may also consider purchasing franchises in other industries. 
Government Regulations and Other Regulatory Matters 
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and provincial laws and regulations in North America, Europe, and Australia in areas such as consumer protection, occupational licensing, environmental protection, data privacy, labor and employment, tax, permitting, and other laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we must obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing employee selection, training, and business conduct. 
We, as a franchisor, are subject to various state and provincial laws, and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates our franchising activities in the U.S. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Fourteen states require registration and, together with at least one other state, require specific disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales, and at least twenty states and U.S. territories have “franchise relationship laws” that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. There are also several provinces in Canada that regulate the offer and sale of franchises as well as certain aspects of the franchise relationship. While there are no registration requirements under these provincial franchise laws, they do require pre-sale disclosures similar to those that exist in the U.S. 
We are not aware of any federal, state, local, provincial, or other laws or regulations that are likely to materially alter or impact our revenues, cash flow, or competitive positions or result in any material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect on our operations, particularly on our relationship with franchisees, of any pending or future legislation or regulations or the future interpretation of any existing laws, including any newly enacted laws, that may impact us or our franchisees. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 11,000 full-time employees, including approximately 9,200 employees at company-operated locations. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We 
consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and prospective employees. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, executive officers, and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. We strive for exceptional performance and results, which is why meritocracy and performance-based compensation are part of our core values. We provide employees the opportunity to grow and to be rewarded based on results. 
Our franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees are not employees of Driven Brands. Our independent operators at independently-operated car wash locations are responsible for the site-level labor and as such, are not employees of Driven Brands. 
Intellectual Property 
Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and conduct of business. We own or have the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other foreign trademark registration offices or exist under common law in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services include, but are not limited to ABRA®, CARSTAR®, DrivenBrands®, IMO®, MAACO®, Meineke Car Care Centers®, PH Vitres D’Autos®, Spire Supply®, Take 5 Oil Change®, Take 5 Car Wash®, Uniban®, Auto Glass Now®, and 1-800-Radiator & A/C®. We also license or sublicense, as applicable, the Fix Auto USA® trademark for use in connection with our business in the United States. We also own domain names, including our primary domain “www.drivenbrands.com.” 
Seasonality 
Seasonal changes may moderately impact the demand for our automotive repair and maintenance services, car washes, and products. For example, customers may purchase fewer undercar services during the winter months, when miles driven tend to be lower. In addition, customers may defer or forego car washes or vehicle maintenance such as oil changes at any time during periods of inclement weather.
