 Background
 Information contained in this report concerning the electric power supply industry and the distributed generation market, our general expectations concerning this industry and this market, and our position within this industry are based on market research, industry publications, other publicly available information and assumptions made by us based on this information and our knowledge of this industry and this market, which we believe to be reasonable.  Although we believe that the market research, industry publications and other publicly available information, including the sources that we cite in this report, are reliable, they have not been independently verified by us and, accordingly, we cannot assure you that such information is accurate in all material respects.  Our estimates, particularly as they relate to our general expectations concerning the electric power supply industry and the distributed generation market, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this report.
 As used in this report, all degrees refer to Fahrenheit (“F”); kilowatt (“kW”) and megawatt (“MW”) numbers designate nominal or rated capacity of the referenced power plant; “efficiency” or “electrical efficiency” means the ratio of the electrical energy generated in the conversion of a fuel to the total energy contained in the fuel (lower heating value, the standard for power plant generation, assumes the water in the product is in vapor form; as opposed to higher 
 5


heating value, which assumes the water in the product is in liquid form, net of parasitic load); kW means 1,000 watts; MW means 1,000,000 watts; “kilowatt hour” (“kWh”) is equal to 1kW of power supplied to or taken from an electric circuit steadily for one hour; and one British Thermal Unit (“Btu”) is equal to the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of pure water from 59oF to 60oF at a specified constant pressure.
 All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 Additional Technical Terms and Definitions 
 Advanced Technologies - Advanced Technologies projects involve the development of new products or applications based on existing carbonate technology or new electrochemical technologies.  Examples are carbon capture, distributed hydrogen, solid oxide fuel cells and solid oxide electrolysis cell technologies.  Advanced Technologies projects are typically externally funded by government or private sources and executed by our Advanced Technologies Group.
 Availability - A measure of the amount of time a system is available to operate, as a fraction of total calendar time.  For power generation equipment, an industry standard (IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 762, “Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability and Productivity”) is used to compute availability. “Availability percentage” is calculated as total period hours since Commercial Operations Date less hours not producing electricity due to planned and unplanned maintenance divided by total period hours. Grid disturbances, force majeure events and site specific issues such as a lack of available fuel supply or customer infrastructure repair do not penalize the calculation of availability according to this standard.
 Carbonate Fuel Cell (“CFC”) - Carbonate fuel cells, such as the fuel cell power plants produced and sold by FuelCell Energy, are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic-based matrix. CFCs operate at high temperatures, enabling the use of a nickel-based catalyst, a lower cost alternative to precious metal catalysts used in some other fuel cell technologies.
 Combined Heat & Power (“CHP”) - A power plant configuration or mode of operation featuring simultaneous on-site generation from the same unit of fuel of both electricity and heat with the heat used to produce steam, hot water or heated air for both heating and cooling applications.
 Commercial Operations Date (“COD”) - The date that testing and commissioning of a fuel cell project is completed and the fuel cell power plant is operational with power being generated and sold to the end-user.
 Distributed Generation - Electric power that is generated where it is needed (distributed throughout the power grid) rather than from a central location. Centrally generated power requires extensive transmission networks that require maintenance and experience efficiency losses during transmission while distributed generation does not.  Distributed generation is small to mid-size power plants, typically generating 75 MW or less.  Central generation is large power plants generating hundreds or even thousands of MW.
 Micro-grids - Micro-grids are localized electric grids that can disconnect from the traditional electric grid to operate autonomously and strengthen grid resiliency.  Micro-grids can be composed only of SureSource power plants due to their continual power output or combine a variety of power generation types such as fuel cells and solar arrays.
 Nitrogen Oxides (“NOx”) - Generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the NOx are colorless and odorless; however, they are a major precursor to smog production and acid rain. One common pollutant, Nitrogen Dioxide, along with particles in the air, can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas. NOx form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, traditional fossil-fuel fired electric utility generation, and other industrial, commercial and residential sources that burn fuels.
 Particulate Matter (“PM”) - Solid or liquid particles emitted into the air that are generally caused by the combustion of materials or dust generating activities. Particulate matter caused by combustion can be harmful to humans as the fine particles of chemicals, acids and metals may get lodged in lung tissue.
 6


Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) - A Power Purchase Agreement is a contract that enables a power user to purchase energy under a long-term contract where the user agrees to pay a predetermined rate for the kilowatt-hours delivered from a power generating asset while avoiding the need to own the equipment and pay the upfront capital cost.  The PPA rate is typically fixed (with an escalation clause tied to a consumer price index or similar index), or pegged to a floating index that is on par with or below the current electricity rate being charged by the local utility company, and is typically for a term of 10 to 20 years.
 Renewable Biogas - Renewable biogas is fuel produced by biological breakdown of organic material.  Biogas is commonly produced in biomass digesters employing bacteria in a heated and controlled oxygen environment.  These digesters are typically used at wastewater treatment facilities or food processors to break down solid waste and the biogas produced is a byproduct of the waste digestion. Biogas can be used as a renewable fuel source for SureSource fuel cell plants located on site where the biogas is produced with gas cleanup, or it can be processed further to meet pipeline fuel standards and injected into a gas pipeline network, which is termed Directed Biogas.
 Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (“SOEC”) - Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells are electrochemical cells with the same cell and stack structure as Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, but are operated in reverse – instead of producing power from fuel and oxygen, SOEC cells produce hydrogen and oxygen from steam when supplied with power.  The Solid Oxide Fuel Cell platform can be operated in fuel cell mode (producing power from fuel) or electrolysis mode (producing hydrogen from power) and can alternate between the two.
 Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (“SOFC”) - Solid Oxide Fuel Cells are electrochemical cells with a non-porous ceramic material as the electrolyte. SOFCs operate at high temperatures (slightly higher than carbonate fuel cells) eliminating the need for costly precious-metal catalysts, thereby reducing cost. Like carbonate fuel cells, the high operating temperature enables internal reforming of the hydrogen rich fuel source.
 Sulfur Oxide (“SOx”) - Sulfur oxide refers to any one of the following: sulfur monoxide, sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and sulfur trioxide. SO2 is a byproduct of various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum contain sulfur compounds, and generate SO2 when burned.  SOx compounds are particulate and acid rain precursors.
 Overview
 Our mission and purpose is to utilize our state-of-the-art fuel cell power plants to provide environmentally responsible solutions for various applications such as utility-scale and on-site power generation, carbon capture, local hydrogen production for both transportation and industry, and long duration energy storage. Our systems cater to the needs of customers across several industries, including utility companies, municipalities, universities, government entities and a variety of industrial and commercial enterprises.  With more than 8.0 million megawatt hours of ultra-clean power produced, FuelCell Energy is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, installing, operating and maintaining environmentally responsible fuel cell distributed power solutions.
 We provide comprehensive turn-key power generation solutions to our customers, including power plant installation, operations and maintenance under multi-year power purchase and service agreements. We both develop projects as well as sell equipment directly to customers, providing either a complete solution of engineering, installing and servicing the fuel cell power plant, or selling the power plant equipment and providing long-term maintenance only.  We offer to arrange financing structures that enable power users to benefit from the multitude of advantages of clean onsite power while avoiding an up-front capital investment. Utilizing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) or lease structures, the end-user of the power hosts the installation and only pays for power as it is delivered. For projects that we develop, the end user of the power typically enters into a PPA, and we have the option to either identify a project investor to purchase the power plant and assume the PPA, or retain the project and recognize electricity revenue ratably over the term of the PPA.  We target large-scale power users with our megawatt-class installations.  To provide a frame of reference, one megawatt is adequate to continually power approximately 1,000 average sized U.S. homes.  Our customer base includes utility companies, municipalities, universities, hospitals, government entities and a variety of industrial and commercial enterprises. Our leading geographic markets are the United States and South Korea, and we are pursuing expanding opportunities in other countries around the world.

Our value proposition is to enable economic returns with clean, affordable, reliable and resilient fuel cell power plants that supply power where consumed. Our products can also be configured for carbon capture, energy recovery and storage applications.  Our solutions are easy-to-site in populated areas as they are clean, operate quietly and without vibrations, and have only modest space requirements.  Fuel cells use an electrochemical process to convert a fuel source into electricity and heat in a highly efficient process that emits virtually no pollutants as the fuel is not burned, generating power that is almost wholly absent of criteria pollutants such as NOx that causes smog, SOx that contributes to acid rain, and particulate matter that can aggravate asthma.  Locating power generation near the point of use reduces reliance on the transmission grid, leading to enhanced energy security and power reliability.  Utilities can minimize or even avoid the cost of transmission or other infrastructure by adopting distributed generation, which saves their customers the cost of installing and maintaining transmission and also avoids the losses associated with transmitting electricity over great distances.  Our power plants provide electricity priced competitively to grid-delivered electricity in certain high cost regions, and our strategy is to continue to reduce costs, which we believe will lead to wider adoption.
 FuelCell Energy was founded as a New York corporation headquartered in Connecticut in 1969 as an applied research organization, providing contract research and development.  The Company went public in 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999.  We began selling stationary fuel cell power plants commercially in 2003.  Today, we develop turn-key distributed power generation solutions, operating and providing comprehensive service for the life of the power plant.
 Business Strategy
 Central to our overall business strategy are four main areas of focus: (1) executing on our backlog and new project awards, (2) growing our generation portfolio, (3) competing for and winning new business around the world, and (4) developing and commercializing our carbon capture, distributed hydrogen and long duration energy storage solutions. We plan to continue to grow our generation portfolio in an effort to drive additional recurring revenue and profitability to complement our project sale model. We also intend to expand our domestic U.S. presence with our “Energy as a Service” model, under which we deliver energy to the customer under a PPA, as there are signs of acceleration of the adoption of distributed generation fuel cells owned by utilities in the U.S. under this model.  Lastly, the products under development in our Advanced Technologies group have great market potential, and we expect to commercially deploy these products over the next several years.
 Our business model involves full life-cycle management of our projects and fuel cell solutions, from design through operation and maintenance. Our solutions employ a common core fuel cell technology, allowing our common product design to target global markets including on-site and utility-scale projects for the supply, recovery and storage of energy.  We selectively utilize strategic business alliances and collaboration agreements for market development, financing and cost reductions.  Our extensive intellectual property portfolio consists of patents, trade secrets and collective experience, which acts as a foundation for expanding and maximizing our solutions portfolio.  Our business model is based on multiple revenue streams, including power plant and component sales; engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) revenue; royalty and license revenue; recurring service revenue, including long-term service agreements; recurring electricity sales under PPAs and tariffs for projects we retain in our generation portfolio; and revenue from public and private industry research contracts under Advanced Technologies.   
 
Market Adoption
 We target vertical markets and geographic regions that value clean distributed generation, are located where there are high energy costs, and are aligned with regulatory frameworks that harmonize energy, economic and environmental policies.  Our business model addresses all three of these policy areas with highly efficient and affordable distributed generation that delivers de-centralized power in a low-carbon, virtually pollutant-free manner. Geographic markets that meet these criteria and where we are already well established include South Korea, the Northeast U.S. and California.  We have also installed and operated plants in Europe and Asia, in addition to North America. We selectively develop strategic business relationships with some of the leading energy and power generation companies in our target markets to facilitate demand and deploy our projects. While the Company has made significant progress with reducing costs and creating markets since the commercialization of our products in 2003, we face two primary challenges in growing the adoption of our distributed power generation solutions.  These are (1) the need to further 
 8


reduce the total cost of ownership, and (2) the continued education and acknowledgment of the value that our solutions provide.  The business model for the generation and delivery of electricity for over a century has been central generation, which is large-scale power generation in distant locations away from urban areas with transmission and distribution to the end users.  Distributed generation enhances existing utility models and it is being embraced in an increasing number of markets to improve grid operations.  
 We work with utilities and power generators to demonstrate how our solutions complement central generation by incrementally adding clean power generation when and where needed.  One example of this is a 40 megawatt fuel-cell only solicitation by Long Island Power Authority (“LIPA”) to address load pockets or power needs in specific areas of its service territory.  LIPA operates in an area with high population density, scarce and expensive land, the need for resiliency to ensure power during storms, and vocal citizens that may not welcome new transmission lines in their neighborhoods.  The structure of the program reflected the unique value drivers of fuel cells to cleanly, efficiently and economically supply power where it is needed, which for LIPA is near existing electrical substations.  LIPA awarded the entire 40 MW solicitation to FuelCell Energy through a competitive bidding process after a review of more than 375 MW of proposals from multiple developers.  
 Fuel Cell Power Plant Ownership Structures
 In the United States, historically customers or developers generally purchased our fuel cell power plants outright.  As the size of our fuel cell projects has grown and availability of project capital has improved, project structures have transitioned to predominantly PPAs, which is what we refer to as the “Energy as a Service” model.  Under a PPA, the end-user of the power commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10 to 20 years.  Examples of actual end-users that have previously entered into PPAs include universities, a pharmaceutical company, hospitals and utilities.  A primary advantage for the end-user is that it does not need to commit its own capital or own a power generating asset, yet it enjoys the multiple benefits of fuel cell power generation.
 Once the PPA is executed, construction of the fuel cell project can begin.  At or around COD, the project may be sold to a project investor or retained by the Company.  If the project is sold, revenue from the product sale is recognized.  If the project is retained, electricity sales are recognized monthly over the term of the PPA. We report the financial performance of retained projects as generation revenue and income. Our decision to retain certain projects is based in part on the recurring, predictable cash flows these projects can offer to us, the proliferation of power purchase agreements in the industry and the potential access to capital.  Retaining PPAs affords the Company the full benefit of future cash flows under the PPAs, which are higher than if we sell the projects.  As of October 31, 2018, our operating portfolio of retained projects totaled 11.2 MW with an additional 83.1 MW under development or construction.  The Company plans to continue to grow this portfolio in a balanced manner while also selling projects to investors when that presents the best value and opportunity for the Company’s capital. In furtherance of the asset ownership “Energy as a Service” model, the Company, through its subsidiary FuelCell Energy Finance, LLC, on October 31, 2018, signed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Dominion Generation, Inc. (“Dominion”) to reacquire the 15 MW Bridgeport fuel cell park project. The Company is currently working to arrange financing to close the transaction with Dominion.
 
Levelized Cost of Energy
 Our fuel cell projects deliver power at a rate comparable to pricing from the grid in our targeted markets.  Policy programs that help to support adoption of clean distributed power generation often lead to below-grid pricing.  We measure power costs by calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) over the life of the project.  
 There are several primary elements to LCOE for our fuel cell projects, including (1) capital cost, (2) operations and maintenance, (3) fuel, and (4) cost of capital.  Given the level of integration in our business model of manufacturing, installing and operating fuel cell power plants, there are multiple areas and opportunities for cost reductions. We are actively managing and reducing costs in all four LCOE areas as follows: 
  
• | Capital Cost - Capital costs of our projects include costs to manufacture, install, interconnect, and complete any on-site application requirements such as configuring for a micro-grid and/or heating and cooling applications. We have reduced the product cost of our megawatt-class power plants by more than 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9


 
60% from the first commercial installation in 2003 through our ongoing product cost reduction program, which involves every aspect of our business including engineering, procurement and manufacturing. Further cost reductions will be primarily obtained from higher production volumes which will lead to reductions in the per-unit cost of materials purchased, supported by continued actions with engineering and manufacturing cost reductions. On-site, our experienced EPC team has substantial experience in working with contractors and local utilities to safely and efficiently execute our projects and we expect continued cost reduction in this area with additional experience and continued transition to multi-MW fuel cell parks. Larger projects offer scale and the opportunity to consolidate systems and reduce costs. In addition to these cost reduction efforts, our technology roadmap includes plans to increase the output of our power plants which will add further value for our customers and reduce LCOE. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operations and Maintenance - We remotely monitor, operate, and maintain the fuel cell power plants to optimize performance and meet or exceed expected operating parameters throughout the plants’ operational life. Operations and maintenance (“O&M”) is a key driver for power plants to deliver on projected electrical output and revenue. Many of our service agreements and PPAs include guarantees for system performance levels, including electrical output. Customers benefit from predictable savings and financial returns over the life of the contract, while minimizing risk. Each model of our SureSource power plants has a design life of 25 to 30 years. The fuel cell modules, with a 5 to 7-year cell design life, go through periodic replacement, while the balance of plant (“BOP”) systems, which consist of conventional mechanical and electrical equipment, are maintained over the plant life. The price for planned periodic fuel cell stack replacements is included in our service agreements. We expect to continually drive down the cost of O&M with an expanding fleet which will leverage our investments in this area. Additionally, we have completed the development of fuel cells that have a longer life, which will reduce O&M costs by increasing our scheduled module replacement period to seven years. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fuel - Our fuel cells directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat, water, and in certain configurations, other value streams such as high purity hydrogen. Our power plants can operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels, including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane. The high efficiency of the fuel cell results in low carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions when using fossil fuels such as natural gas or propane, and because of our fuel flexibility our systems are essentially carbon neutral when operating on biogas fuels. Our SureSource power plants deliver electrical efficiencies of 47%, for systems targeting CHP applications and 60% efficiency for systems targeting electric-only applications such as grid support and data centers. In a CHP configuration, our plants can deliver even higher system efficiency, depending on the application. Considering utilized waste heat in CHP applications, total efficiency of systems using our power plants is typically 60% to 80% and can be as high as 90%. These efficiencies compare to average US fossil fuel plant generation efficiency of about 40% with grid line losses. Increasing electrical efficiency and reducing fuel costs is a key element of our operating cost reduction efforts. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost of Capital - Most of our MW-scale projects have historically been financed either by the energy user/off-taker that owns the asset or a project investor that owns the asset and sells energy to the off-taker. We have responded to an evolving market with greater interest in the “Energy as a Service” PPA approach by end users of the power that prefer to avoid the up-front investment in power generation assets. Our PPA projects create predictable recurring revenue that is not dependent on weather or the time of the day, investment tax credits, accelerated tax depreciation or other incentives. Credit risk is mitigated by contracting with customers with strong credit. In addition, we offer meaningful system-level output performance guarantees over the life of our projects. As a result, cost of capital for our projects has declined over time, partially due to our operating experience. With continued execution, we expect to continue to attract project finance capital, and with financial and project performance credibility continuing to improve, we expect to achieve reductions in risk premiums leading to lower financing costs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An additional factor that benefits fuel cells when comparing LCOE to other forms of power generation is that our solutions provide delivered electricity that minimizes or even avoids the costs of transmission. 
 When comparing LCOE across different forms of power generation, transmission needs to be considered in the evaluation.  Power generation far from where the power is used requires transmission, which is a cost to ratepayers 
 10


and is inefficient due to line losses of power in the transmission process. Transmission systems are also more vulnerable to storm-related and other interruptions than locally-generated energy.
 We believe that our strong business model and strategy, demonstrated project development and execution, plant operating performance, and strategic relationships will support accelerated adoption of our fuel cell solutions.
 Markets
 Vertical Markets
 Access to clean, affordable and reliable power defines modern lifestyles.  The ability to provide power cleanly and efficiently is taking on greater importance and urgency in many regions of the world.  Central generation and its associated transmission and distribution grid are difficult to site, costly, prone to interruption and generally take many years to permit and build.  Some types of power generation that were widely adopted in the past, such as nuclear power, are no longer welcome in certain regions.  The cost and impact to public health and the environment of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions impact the siting of new power generation.  The attributes of SureSource power plants address these challenges by providing virtually particulate emission-free power and, where desired, thermal energy at the point of use in a highly efficient process that is affordable to consumers.
 Our solutions are installed on both sides of the electric meter, meaning that we serve on-site markets supplying power directly to the end user, as well as utility-scale projects that supply power to the electric grid.  We target seven distinct markets including:
  
(1) | Utilities and Independent Power Producers,
----+-------------------------------------------


(2) | Industrial and Process applications,
----+-------------------------------------


(3) | Education and Health care,
----+---------------------------


(4) | Data Centers and Communication,
----+--------------------------------


(5) | Wastewater treatment,
----+----------------------


(6) | Government, and
----+----------------


(7) | Commercial and Hospitality.
----+----------------------------

 The Utilities and Independent Power Producers segment is our largest vertical market with customers that include utilities on the East and West coasts of the United States, such as Avangrid Holdings (NYSE: AGR) and Long Island Power & Light. In Europe, utility customers include E.ON Connecting Energies (DAX: EOAN), one of the largest utilities in the world, and Switzerland-based ewz.  In Korea, we are contracted to operate and maintain a 20 MW plant for Korea Southern Power Company (“KOSPO”). 
 Our SureSource power plants are producing power for a variety of industrial, commercial, municipal and government customers, including manufacturing facilities, pharmaceutical processing facilities, universities, healthcare facilities and wastewater treatment facilities.  These institutions desire efficient, ultra-clean continuous power to reduce operating expenses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid pollutant emissions to meet their sustainability goals.  Combined heat and power fuel cell applications further support economic and sustainability initiatives by minimizing or avoiding the use of combustion based boilers for heat.
 Our products are fuel flexible, utilizing clean natural gas and renewable biogas generated by the customer on-site or directed biogas generated at a distant location and transported via the existing common carrier gas pipeline network.  In addition, we have demonstrated other fuel sources including coal syngas and propane.
 As intermittent renewable technologies such as wind and solar power are deployed more widely, the need for a clean, continuous power generation that complements and balances these sources becomes greater to maintain grid stability and consistent power supply for on-site applications.  Our installed base includes a number of locations where our customers use SureSource plants for meeting power needs that complements intermittent wind and/or solar power generation.

Our fuel cell solutions are well suited for micro-grid applications, either as the sole source of power generation, or integrated with other forms of power generation.  We have fuel cells operating as micro-grids at universities and municipalities, including one university micro-grid owned by Clearway Energy and a municipal-based micro-grid owned by Avangrid.  For the municipal-based system, under normal operation, the fuel cell supplies power to the grid.  If the grid is disrupted, the fuel cell plant will automatically disconnect from the grid and power a number of critical municipal buildings. Heat from this fuel cell plant is used by the local high school.
 Wastewater treatment facilities, food and beverage processors, and agricultural operations produce biogas as a byproduct of their operations. Disposing of this greenhouse gas can be harmful to the environment if released into the atmosphere or flared. Our SureSource power plants convert this biogas into electricity and heat efficiently and economically. Wastewater facilities with anaerobic digesters are an attractive market for our SureSource solution including the power plant as well as treatment of the biogas. Since our fuel cells operate on the renewable biogas produced by the wastewater treatment process and the heat is used to support daily operations at the wastewater treatment facility, the overall thermal efficiency of these installations is high, supporting economics and sustainability.
 We estimate that the addressable distributed generation market and geographies in which we compete for the supply of energy, including distributed hydrogen production, is approximately a $22 billion opportunity, with approximately 40-45% consisting of power plant sales and the remainder representing associated service agreements.  We estimate that the addressable market for the recovery of energy, including our fuel cell carbon capture solution and our gas pipeline application, is approximately $28 billion, assuming only a 1% penetration rate of addressable coal and gas-fired central generation power plant facilities within the geographies where we do business, and only 25% carbon capture at these coal or gas-fired plants.  We believe there are additional market opportunities for capture from industrial thermal sources, such as boilers, in industries like steel and cement production.  The addressable energy storage market is still developing as different technologies are beginning to come to market with different approaches to storage and different storage durations.  We estimate that the addressable market for long duration storage may be in the range of tens of billions of dollars.
 Products
 Our core fuel cell products offer ultra-clean, highly efficient power generation for customers, including the 1.4 MW SureSource 1500TM, the 2.8 MW SureSource 3000TM, and the 3.7 MW SureSource 4000TM.  The plants are scalable for multi-megawatt utility applications or on-site CHP generation for a broad range of applications.  We provide a comprehensive and complete turn-key fuel cell project that includes project development, EPC services, and O&M, as well as arranging financing structures that enable customers to benefit from the advantages of clean power while avoiding an up-front capital investment.
 Our proprietary carbonate fuel cell technology generates electricity directly from a fuel, such as natural gas or renewable biogas, by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to produce hydrogen. This internal “one-step” reforming process results in a simpler, more efficient, and cost-effective energy conversion system compared with external reforming fuel cells.  Additionally, natural gas has an established infrastructure and is readily available in our existing and target markets compared to some types of fuel cells that require high purity hydrogen. Our fuel cells operate at approximately 1,100° F. An advantage of high temperature fuel cells is that they do not require the use of precious metal electrodes required by lower temperature fuel cells, such as proton-exchange membrane (“PEM”) fuel cells.  As a result, we are able to use less expensive and readily available industrial metals as catalysts for our fuel cell components.  
 The SureSource product line is a global platform based on carbonate fuel cell technology.  Using a standard design globally enables volume-based cost reduction and optimal resource utilization.  Our power plants utilize a variety of available fuels to produce electricity electrochemically, in a process that is highly efficient, quiet, and due to the avoidance of combustion, produces virtually no particulate pollutants. Thus, our plants generate more power and fewer emissions for a given unit of fuel than combustion-based power generation of a similar size, making them economical and environmentally responsible power generation solutions.  In addition to electricity, our standard configuration produces high quality heat (approximately 700° F), suitable for heating facilities or water, or steam for industrial processes or absorption cooling.  Our system’s efficiencies can reach up to 90%, depending on the application, when configured for CHP.

We market different configurations of the SureSource plants to meet specific market needs for the supply, recovery and storage of energy, including:
 Energy Supply
  
• | On-Site Power (Behind the Meter): Customers benefit from improved power reliability and energy security from on-site power that reduces reliance on the electric grid. Utilization of the high quality heat produced by the fuel cell in a CHP configuration supports economics and sustainability goals by lessening or even avoiding the need for combustion-based boilers for heat and its associated cost, pollutants and carbon emissions. On-site CHP power projects generally range in size from an individual SureSource 1500 to combining multiple SureSource 3000 or SureSource 4000 power plants for larger on-site projects. For example, an installation at a pharmaceutical company uses two SureSource 3000 power plants for 5.6 MW of power and heat production while an installation currently contracted for a U.S. Navy base will use two SureSource 4000 power plants for 7.4 MW of power.

• | Utility Grid Support: The SureSource power plants are scalable, which enables siting multiple fuel cell power plants together in a fuel cell park. Fuel cell parks enable utilities to add clean and continuous multi-megawatt power generation when and where needed and enhance the resiliency of the electric grid by reducing reliance on large central generation plants and the associated transmission grid. Consolidating certain steps for multiple plants, such as fuel processing, reduces the cost per megawatt hour for fuel cell parks compared to individual fuel cell power plants. Fuel cell park examples include a five plant, 14.9 MW fuel cell park in Bridgeport, Connecticut that is supplying the electric grid, and multiple fuel cell parks in South Korea in excess of 10 MW each that supply power to the electric grid and high quality heat to district heating systems. By producing power near the point of use, our fuel cells help to ease congestion of the electric grid and can also enable the smart grid via distributed generation combined with continuous monitoring and operation by our service organization. Thus, our solutions can avoid or reduce investment in new central generation and transmission infrastructure which is costly, difficult to site and expensive to maintain. Deploying our SureSource power plants throughout a utility service territory can also help utilities comply with government-mandated clean energy regulations and meet air quality standards. Examples of fuel cells parks located throughout a utility service territory to avoid costly transmission include the three LIPA projects to be built totaling 39.8 MW. Our products can be part of a total power generation solution with our high efficiency products providing continuous power, and can be combined with intermittent power generation, such as solar or wind, or less efficient combustion-based equipment that provides peaking or load following power.

• | Higher Electrical Efficiency - Multi-Megawatt Applications: The SureSource 4000 is designed to extract more electrical power from each unit of fuel with electrical efficiency of approximately 60% and targets applications with large load requirements and limited waste heat utilization such as utility/grid support or data centers. This 3.7 MW plant is configured with a series of three fuel cell modules that operate in sequence, yielding a higher electrical efficiency than the standard SureSource 3000 configuration of two fuel cell modules operating in parallel. The heat energy and unused hydrogen from two fuel cell modules is supplied to the third module, enhancing overall electrical efficiency. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Distributed Hydrogen: The SureSource fuel cells internally reform the fuel source (i.e. natural gas or biogas) to obtain hydrogen. The SureSource plants can be configured for tri-generation, supplying power, heat and high purity hydrogen. Power output is modestly reduced to support hydrogen generation, which can then be used for industrial applications such as metal or glass processing, or petrochemical, or transportation applications. Siting the tri-generation fuel cell plant at a source of biogas, such as a wastewater treatment facility, enables the generation of renewable hydrogen for transportation, an attractive proposition to regulatory and legislative officials and auto companies. We have announced the first commercial MW-scale application of this product configuration at the Port of Long Beach, California which will support Toyota’s logistical support facility. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Micro-grid: The SureSource plants can also be configured as a micro-grid, either independently or with other forms of power generation. We have multiple examples of our solutions operating within micro-grids, some individually and some with other forms of power generation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


Energy Recovery
  
• | Gas Pipeline Applications: SureSource RecoveryTM power plants are used in natural gas pipeline applications, harnessing energy that is otherwise lost during the natural gas pressure-reduction (“letdown”) process. Also, thermal energy produced as a byproduct of the fuel cell’s operation supports the letdown process, improving the letdown station’s carbon footprint and enhancing the project’s economics. Depending on the specific gas flows and application, the SureSource Recovery configuration is capable of achieving electrical efficiencies of up to 70%. A 3.4 megawatt system is owned by a subsidiary of Avangrid and operating at a gas letdown station owned by its regulated gas utility subsidiary. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Carbon Capture: The SureSource CaptureTM system separates CO2 from the flue gases of natural gas, biomass or coal-fired power plants or industrial facilities while producing ultra-clean power. Exhaust flue gas from the coal/biomass/gas plant or industrial facility is supplied to the fuel cell, which extracts and purifies the CO2 in the flue gas as part of the fuel cell power generation process. Carbon capture systems can be implemented in increments, starting with as little as 5% capture with no appreciable change in the cost of power and with minimal capital outlay. Our solution generates a return on capital resulting from the fuel cell's production of electricity rather than an increase in operating expense required by other carbon capture technologies, and can extend the life of existing power plants, enabling low carbon utilization of domestic coal and gas resources. During 2018, the Company completed the first phase design and engineering of the first carbon capture configured SureSource 3000 power plant, planned to be located at a mixed coal/gas fired power station owned by a subsidiary of Southern Company. The project was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) and ExxonMobil. The Company is working to secure the funding to move to the second phase of the project, which includes construction of the carbon capture fuel cell plant. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Energy Storage
 We are developing our long-duration SureSource StorageTM solution, creating a system that utilizes both SOFC and SOEC technology and using hydrogen as the energy storage medium.  Our solid oxide stacks are capable of alternating between electrolysis and power generation mode.  Instead of producing power from fuel and air, a solid oxide fuel cell stack in electrolysis mode splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using supplied electricity.  Hydrogen is an energy carrier that can be compressed and stored for long durations in storage tubes or underground.  
 This allows us to configure efficient and cost effective energy storage solutions where hydrogen is produced from electricity in electrolysis mode and stored until power is needed, at which point the stored hydrogen is used in the same stacks to produce electricity.  Storage capacity is easily expanded by adding additional storage tanks, a low cost approach for storage applications requiring many hours or days of storage capacity.  The need for long duration energy storage behind the meter and on the utility grid will increase as the penetration of intermittent renewable sources on the grid expands.  This solution can be sited adjacent to an electric substation, avoiding the need for transmission.
 In summary, our solutions offer many advantages:
  
• | Distributed generation: Generating power near the point of use improves power reliability and energy security and lessens the need for costly and difficult-to-site generation and transmission infrastructure, enhancing the resiliency of the grid.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ultra-clean: Our SureSource solutions produce electricity electrochemically − without combustion − directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas and renewable biogas in a highly efficient process. The virtual absence of pollutants facilitates siting the power plants in regions with clean air permitting regulations and is an important public health benefit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High efficiency: Fuel cells are the most efficient power generation option in their size class, providing the most power from a given unit of fuel, reducing fuel costs. This high electrical efficiency also reduces carbon emissions compared to less efficient combustion-based power generation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combined heat and power: Our power plants provide both electricity and usable high quality heat/steam from the same unit of fuel. The heat can be used for facility heating and cooling or further enhancing the electrical efficiency of the power plant in a combined cycle configuration. When used in CHP configurations, system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Reliability / continuous operation: Our SureSource power plants improve power reliability and energy security by lessening reliance on transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid. Unlike solar and wind power, fuel cells are able to operate continuously regardless of weather or time of day.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fuel flexibility: Our SureSource power plants can operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels, including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability: Our solutions are scalable, providing a cost-effective solution to adding power incrementally as demand grows, such as multi-megawatt fuel cell parks supporting the electric grid.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quiet operation: Because they produce power without combustion and contain very few moving parts, our SureSource solutions operate quietly and without vibrations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy to site: Our SureSource power plants are relatively easy to site by virtue of their ultra-clean emissions profile, modest space requirements and quiet operation. These characteristics facilitate the installation of the power plants in urban locations with scarce and expensive land. A 10 MW fuel cell park only requires about one acre of land whereas an equivalent size solar array requires up to seven to ten times as much land, illustrating how fuel cell parks are easy to site in high density areas with constrained land resources, and adjacent to the demand source thereby avoiding costly transmission construction. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SureSource Emissions Profile
 Fuel cells are devices that directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat and water.  Because fuel cells generate power electrochemically rather than by combusting (burning) fuels, they are more efficient in extracting energy from fuels, and produce less CO2 and only trace levels of pollutants compared to combustion-type power generation.  The following table illustrates the favorable emission profile of our SureSource power plants:
 
 
 | Emissions (Lbs. Per MWh)
------------------------------------------+-------------------------
 | NOX | | SO2 | | PM | CO2 | CO2 with CHP
Average U.S. Fossil Fuel Plant | | 0.48 | | 2.6 | | 0.08 | | 1,533 | | NA 
Microturbine (60 kW) | | 0.44 | | 0.008 | | 0.09 | | 1,596 | | 520 - 680
Small Natural Gas Turbine | | 1.15 | | 0.008 | | 0.08 | | 1,494 | | 520 - 680
SureSource - natural gas | | 0.01 | | 0.0001 | | 0.00002 | | 940 | | 520 - 680
SureSource 4000 High Efficiency Plant | | 0.01 | | 0.0001 | | 0.00002 | | 740 | | 520 - 680
SureSource - utility scale carbon capture | | 0.01 | | 0.0001 | | 0.00002 | | 80 | | n/a 
SureSource - renewable biogas | | 0.01 | | 0.0001 | | 0.00002 | < 0 | | < 0

 
For power plants operating on natural gas, higher electrical efficiency results in lower CO2, and also results in less fuel needed per kWh of electricity generated and Btu of heat produced. The high efficiency of our products results in significantly less CO2 per unit of power production compared to the average U.S. fossil fuel power plant, and the carbon emissions are reduced even further when configured for combined heat and power.  When operating on renewable biogas, government agencies and regulatory bodies generally classify our power plants as carbon neutral due to the renewable nature of the fuel source.
 High electrical efficiency reduces customers' exposure to volatile fuel costs, minimizes operating costs, and provides maximum electrical output from a finite fuel source. Our power plants achieve electrical efficiencies of 47% to 60% or higher depending on configuration, location, and application, and even higher total efficiency in a CHP configuration, depending on the application.  This represents delivered efficiency as our distributed solutions generate power near the point of use, avoiding the line losses inherent in transmission.  The electric grid in the United States is only approximately 35% electrically efficient and typically does not support CHP configurations.
 Manufacturing and Service Facilities
 We design and manufacture the core SureSource fuel cell components that are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack.  For MW-size power plants, four fuel cell stacks are combined to build a fuel cell module.  To complete the power plant, the fuel cell module or modules are combined with the BOP.  The mechanical BOP processes the 
 15


incoming fuel such as natural gas or renewable biogas and includes various fuel handling and processing equipment such as pipes and blowers. The electrical BOP processes the power generated for use by the customer and includes electrical interface equipment such as an inverter.  The BOP components are either purchased directly from suppliers or the manufacturing is outsourced based on our designs and specifications.  This strategy allows us to leverage our manufacturing capacity, focusing on the critical aspects of the power plant where we have specialized knowledge, expertise and possess extensive intellectual property.  BOP components are shipped directly to a project site and are then assembled with the fuel cell module into a complete power plant.
 We operate a 167,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the individual cell packages and assemble the fuel cell modules. This facility also houses our global service center. It is expected that, in early fiscal year 2019, our completed modules will be conditioned in Torrington as well, and shipped directly to customer sites, rather than first being shipped to our Danbury, Connecticut location for conditioning as in the past. This recent relocation of conditioning activities to the Torrington, Connecticut factory location improves the cost and efficiency of the final manufacturing process.  Annual capacity (module manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) is 100 MW per year, with full utilization under the Torrington facility’s current configuration.  The Torrington facility is sized to accommodate annual production capacity of 200 MW per year.
 The expansion of the Torrington facility has enabled the consolidation of warehousing and service facilities, which has resulted in reduced leasing expenses.  The additional space is also expected to lead to additional manufacturing efficiencies by providing the needed space to re-configure the manufacturing lines without interrupting production.  As demand supports, a second phase will be undertaken to add manufacturing equipment to increase annual capacity to 200 MW.  The State of Connecticut had previously extended two low interest long term loans to us (one for each of the two phases) and up to $10.0 million of tax credits.  Each loan was anticipated to be $10.0 million, with an interest rate of 2.0% and a term of 15 years.  Originally, up to 50% of the principal was forgivable if certain job creation and retention targets are met.  We previously received the proceeds of the first $10 million loan to support the first phase of the expansion and have received extensions from the State of Connecticut to meet the required job targets. 
 The Torrington production and service facility and the Danbury corporate headquarters and research and development facility are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified and our Field Service Operations (which maintains the installed fleet of our plants) is ISO 9001:2015 certified, reinforcing the tenets of the FuelCell Energy Quality Management System and our core values of continual improvement and commitment to quality and environmental stewardship.
 We have a manufacturing and service facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of sub-megawatt fuel cell power plants for the remaining sub-megawatt fuel cell power plants in the European market. Our European service activities are also operated out of this location. Our operations in Europe are certified under both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015.
 Raw Materials and Supplier Relationships
 We use various commercially available raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel, which are key inputs to our manufacturing process. Our fuel cell stack raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors and are not considered precious metals.  We have a global integrated supply chain.  While we manufacture the fuel cell module in our Torrington facility, the electrical and mechanical BOPs are assembled by and procured from several suppliers. All of our suppliers must undergo a qualification process. We continually evaluate and qualify new suppliers as we diversify our supplier base in our pursuit of lower costs and consistent quality. We purchase mechanical and electrical BOP componentry from third party vendors, based on our own proprietary designs.
Engineering, Procurement and Construction
 We provide customers with complete turn-key solutions, including the development, engineering, procurement, construction, interconnection and operations for our fuel cell projects.  From an EPC standpoint, we have an extensive history of safe and timely delivery of turn-key projects.  We have developed relationships with many design firms and licensed general contractors and have a repeatable, safe, and efficient execution philosophy that has been successfully demonstrated in numerous jurisdictions, both domestically and abroad, all with an exemplary safety record.  The ability to rapidly and safely execute installations minimizes high cost construction period financing and can assist customers in certain situations when the commercial operating date is time sensitive.

Services and Warranty Agreements
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services, including engineering, project management and installation, and long-term operating and maintenance programs, including trained technicians that remotely monitor and operate our plants around the world, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.  We employ field technicians to service the power plants and maintain service centers near our customers to ensure high availability of our plants.  For all operating fuel cell plants not under a PPA, the customers purchase service agreements, some of which have terms of up to 20 years. Pricing for service contracts is based upon the markets in which we compete and includes all future maintenance and fuel cell module exchanges.  Each model of our SureSource power plants has a design life of 25 to 30 years. The fuel cell modules, with a 5 to 7-year cell design life, go through periodic replacement, while the BOP systems, which consist of conventional mechanical and electrical equipment, are maintained over the plant life.
 Under the typical provisions of both our service agreements and PPAs, we provide services to monitor, operate and maintain power plants to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance is a key driver for power plants to deliver their projected revenue and cash flows.  Many of our PPAs and service agreements include guarantees for system performance, including electrical output and heat rate. Should the power plant not meet the minimum performance levels, we may be required to replace the fuel cell module with a new or used replacement module and/or pay performance penalties.  The service aspects of our business model provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for the Company.  We have committed future production for scheduled fuel cell module exchanges under service agreements and PPAs through the year 2038.  The pricing structure of the service agreements incorporates these scheduled fuel cell module exchanges and the committed nature of this production facilitates our production planning. Our goal is to optimize the power plants to meet expected operating parameters throughout their contracted service term.
 In addition to our service agreements, we provide a warranty for our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. The warranty term in the U.S. is typically 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products.  We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience.
 License Agreements and Royalty Income; Relationship with POSCO Energy
 We have historically relied on POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (“POSCO Energy”) to develop and grow the South Korean and Asian markets for our products and services.  
 We record license fees and are entitled to receive royalty income from POSCO Energy related to manufacturing and technology transfer agreements entered into in 2007, 2009 and 2012.  The Cell Technology Transfer Agreement ("CTTA"), executed in October 2012, provides POSCO Energy with the technology rights to manufacture SureSource power plants in South Korea and the right to sell power plants throughout Asia.  POSCO Energy built a cell manufacturing facility in Pohang, Korea which became operational in late 2015. Annual production capability is 100 MW and the building is sized to accommodate up to 200 MW of annual production. 
 In October 2016, the Company and POSCO Energy extended the terms of the 2007 and 2009 license agreements to be consistent with the term of the CTTA, which expires on October 31, 2027. The CTTA requires POSCO Energy to pay us a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales, as well as a royalty on scheduled fuel cell module replacements under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at plants in Asia under the terms of long term service agreements between POSCO Energy and its customers. In March 2017, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with POSCO Energy to permit us to directly develop the Asian fuel cell business, including the right for us to sell SureSource solutions in South Korea and the broader Asian market. In June 2018, POSCO Energy advised us in writing that it was terminating the MOU effective July 15, 2018.  Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, notwithstanding its termination, we will continue to execute on sales commitments in Asia secured in writing prior to July 15, 2018. POSCO Energy has ceased communications with us. 
 On or about November 2, 2018, POSCO Energy served FuelCell Energy with an arbitration demand, initiating a proceeding to resolve various outstanding amounts between the companies. We have made counterclaims and believe we have valid defenses to the claims made by POSCO Energy. The Company does not currently expect the results of this arbitration to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  
 17


In light of recent developments with POSCO Energy, we are evaluating all of our options with respect to our relationship and agreements with POSCO Energy.
 Advanced Technologies Programs (Third Party Funded Research and Development)
 We undertake both privately-funded and public research and development to expand the markets for our power plants, reduce costs, and expand our technology portfolio in complementary high-temperature fuel cell systems. This research builds on our expertise and the versatility of our fuel cell power plants and contributes to the development of potentially new end markets for our commercial product solution portfolio. Our power plants can be configured to provide a number of value streams including clean electricity, high quality usable heat, hydrogen suitable for vehicle fueling or industrial purposes as well as a configuration to concentrate CO2 from coal, biomass and natural gas fired power plants and industrial applications.  Our Advanced Technologies Programs are focused on commercializing solutions within three strategic areas: (1) carbon capture for emissions reduction and power generation; (2) distributed hydrogen production, compression, and recovery; and (3) SOFC/SOEC for stationary power generation and energy storage. The revenue and associated costs from government and third party sponsored research and development is classified as “Advanced Technologies contract revenues” and “Cost of Advanced Technologies contract revenues,” respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.
 We have historically worked on technology development with various U.S. government departments and agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Government funding, principally from the DOE, provided 8%, 9% and 8% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 Significant commercialization programs on which we are currently working include:
 Carbon Capture – Power generation and industrial applications are the source of two-thirds of the world’s carbon emissions. Coal and natural gas are abundant, low cost resources that are widely used to generate electricity in developed and developing countries, but burning these fuels, as well as burning biomass, results in the emission of criteria pollutants and CO2.  Cost effective and efficient carbon capture from power generation and industrial applications globally represents a large market because it could enable clean use of all available fuels. Our carbonate fuel cell technology separates and concentrates CO2 as a side reaction during the power generation process. Capturing CO2 as a side reaction while generating additional valuable power is an approach that could be more cost effective than other systems which are being considered for carbon capture.
 We announced a five year agreement with ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) in 2016 to pursue research and development of fuel cell carbon capture for central generation gas-fired power plants. Research and development under that agreement has progressed and continues to progress at an accelerated pace. In 2018, we completed the design and engineering work for the installation of a megawatt-class carbon capture fuel cell power plant at a mixed coal/gas-fired power station owned by Alabama Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company.  This project was supported by an award from the DOE and ExxonMobil. The Company has been working to secure funding for the second phase of the project, which would include construction of the carbon capture fuel cell power plant.
 Distributed Hydrogen Production, Compression, and Recovery - On-site or distributed hydrogen generation, produced cleanly, represents an attractive market.  Our high temperature fuel cells generate electricity directly from a fuel by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to supply hydrogen for the electrical generation process.  Gas separation technology can be added to capture hydrogen that is not used by the electrical generation process, and we term this configuration SureSource Hydrogen. This value-added proposition may be compelling for industrial users of hydrogen and transportation applications, further summarized as follows:
 Fueling Applications:  We previously announced a renewable hydrogen generation project under a hydrogen power purchase agreement with Toyota (NYSE: TM).  The multi-megawatt SureSource Hydrogen plant will be located at the Port of Long Beach, California and will use renewable directed biogas for fuel.  Toyota will purchase the hydrogen output of approximately 1,200 kg per day to fuel its fuel cell cars that arrive at the Port from overseas as well as fuel a Class 8 fuel cell truck located at the Port.  Toyota will also purchase a portion of the renewable electricity generated by the fuel cell, with the remainder of the electricity to be sold to the local utility under the California BioMAT program.
 18


We previously demonstrated renewable hydrogen generation under a three year project at the Orange County Wastewater Treatment Facility in Irvine, California, utilizing renewable biogas to supply hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicle fueling and to produce clean renewable electricity.  The demonstration was performed under a sub-contract to Air Products (NYSE: APD), with funding provided by the DOE, California Air Resources Board, South Coast Air Quality Management District, Orange County Sanitation District, and Southern California Gas Company.
 SOFC/SOEC Development and Commercialization: We are working towards commercialization of solid oxide fuel cell technology to target long-duration storage applications utilizing hydrogen as an energy carrier and storage medium.  SOFC power plant design and manufacturing is complementary to our carbonate technology-based MW scale product line and affords us the opportunity to leverage our field operating history, existing expertise in power plant design, fuel processing and high volume manufacturing capabilities, and our existing installation and service infrastructure.  Additionally, the target market for storage applications is electric utilities, which is a market in which we are already active.   
 We perform SOFC/SOEC research and development at our Danbury facility as well as at our dedicated SOFC/SOEC facility in Calgary, Canada.  We are working under a variety of awards from the DOE for development and commercialization of both SOFC and SOEC.  We are currently installing a demonstration SOFC power plant at the Clearway Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
 We believe there are significant market opportunities for distributed hydrogen production, carbon capture, solid oxide fuel cell solutions and energy storage. The demonstration projects described above are steps on the commercialization road map as we leverage third-party resources and funding to accelerate the commercialization and realize the market potential for each of these solutions.
 C
ompany Funded Research and Development
 In addition to research and development performed under research contracts, we also fund our own research and development projects including extending module life, increasing the power output of our modules and reducing the cost of our products.  Current initiatives include increasing the net power output of the fuel cell stacks to 375 kW from 350 kW.  We also recently launched our seven-year life stacks, which extended our stack life from five years to seven years. Greater power output and improved longevity are expected to lead to improved gross margin profitability on a per-unit basis for each power plant sold and improved profitability of service contracts, which will support expanding gross margins for the Company.
 In addition to output and life enhancements, we designed and introduced the 3.7 megawatt SureSource 4000 configuration with increased electrical efficiency, and we continually invest in cost reduction and improving the performance, quality and serviceability of our plants. These efforts continually improve our value proposition.
 Company-funded research and development is included in Research and development expenses (operating expenses) in our consolidated financial statements.  The total research and development expenditures in the consolidated statement of operations, including third party and Company-funded expenditures, are as follows:

Backlog
 
The Company had a contract backlog totaling approximately $1.2 billion as of October 31, 2018 compared to $554.2 million as of October 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, backlog included approximately $316.0 million and $182.3 million, respectively, of service agreements.  Generation backlog as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 was $839.5 million and $296.3 million, respectively.  Service and generation backlog as of October 31, 2018 had an average term of approximately 19 years weighted based on dollar backlog and utility service contracts up to twenty years in duration.  As of October 31, 2018, product sales backlog totaled approximately $1.0 thousand compared to $31.3 million as of October 31, 2017.  As of October 31, 2018, Advanced Technologies contracts backlog totaled $32.4 million, of which $15.9 million was funded and $16.5 million was unfunded, compared to $44.3 million as of October 31, 2017, of which $24.5 million was funded and $19.8 million was unfunded. Generally, our government research and development contracts are subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contracting agency.
 Our backlog amount outstanding is not indicative of amounts to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.  The specific elements of backlog may vary in terms of timing and revenue recognition from less than one year to up to twenty years.  In addition, the Company may retain operating power plants on the balance sheet rather than selling them, thus creating variability in timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, the timing and the nature of our business makes it difficult to predict what portion of our backlog will be filled in the next fiscal year.
 
Backlog represents definitive agreements executed by the Company and our customers. As of October 31, 2018, we also had project awards totaling between $600.0 million and $1.0 billion, depending on whether the projects are sold or retained as part of our generation portfolio.  Project awards referenced by the Company are notifications that the Company has been selected, typically through a competitive bidding process, to enter into definitive agreements. These awards have been publicly disclosed. Negotiations are in process and if successfully completed, project awards will become backlog. 
 Fuel Cell T
echnologies
 Fuel cell technologies are classified according to the electrolyte used by each fuel cell type. Our SureSource technology utilizes a carbonate electrolyte. Carbonate-based fuel cells are well-suited for megawatt-class applications, offering a number of advantages over other types of fuel cells in the markets we are pursuing. These advantages include carbonate fuel cells' ability to generate electricity directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas or renewable biogas, lower raw material costs as the high temperature of the fuel cell enables the use of commodity metals rather than precious metals, and high-quality heat suitable for CHP applications. We are also actively developing SOFC technology, as discussed in the prior “Advanced Technologies Programs” section.  Other fuel cell types that may be used for commercial applications include phosphoric acid and PEM.
 20


The following table illustrates the four principal types of fuel cells, highlighting typical market applications, industry estimates of the electrical efficiency, expected capacity range, and versatility for applications in addition to power generation:
 
 
 | MW- Class | Sub-MW- Class | | Micro CHP | | Mobile
System Size Range | Carbonate (CFC) | Solid Oxide (SOFC) | Phosphoric Acid (PAFC) | | PEM / SOFC | | Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM)
Plant size | 1.4 MW - 3.7 MW | up to 300 kW | up to 440 kW | | < 10 kW | | 5 - 100 kW 
Typical Application | Utilities, Universities, Industrial | Commercial Buildings & “Big-Box” Retail Stores | Commercial Buildings & Grocery Stores | | Residential and Small Commercial | | Transportation 
Fuel | Natural gas, On-site or Directed Biogas, Others | Natural Gas | Natural Gas | | Natural Gas | | Hydrogen

C
ompetition
 Our SureSource power plants compete in the marketplace for stationary distributed generation. In addition to different types of stationary fuel cells, some other technologies that compete in this marketplace include micro-turbines and reciprocating gas engines.
 Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although we are the only domestic company engaged in manufacturing and deployment of stationary carbonate fuel cells. Other emerging fuel cell technologies (and the companies developing them) include small or portable PEM fuel cells (Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power, and increasing activity by numerous automotive companies including Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and GM), stationary phosphoric acid fuel cells (Doosan), stationary solid oxide fuel cells (Bloom Energy), and small residential solid oxide fuel cells (Ceres Power Holdings and Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd.).  Each of these competitors with stationary fuel cell applications has the potential to capture market share in our target markets.
 Other than fuel cell developers, we may compete with companies such as Caterpillar, Cummins, Wartsilla, MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH (MTU), and Detroit Diesel, which manufacture more mature combustion-based distributed power generation equipment, including various engines and turbines, and have well-established manufacturing and distribution operations along with product operating and cost features. Competition on larger MW projects may also come from gas turbine companies like General Electric, Caterpillar Solar Turbines and Kawasaki.
 We also compete against the electric grid, which is readily available to prospective customers.  The electric grid is supplied by traditional centralized power plants, including coal, gas and nuclear, with transmission lines used to transport the electricity to the point of use.
 21


Our stationary fuel cell power plants compete against large scale solar and wind technologies, although we can complement solar and wind intermittency with the continuous power output of the fuel cells.  Solar and wind require specific geographies and weather profiles and require transmission for utility-scale applications as well as a significant amount of land compared to our fuel cell power plants, making it difficult to site MW-class solar and wind projects in urban areas, unlike our solutions.
 We believe that only carbonate fuel cells are suitable for fuel cell carbon capture applications, so our fuel cell carbon capture solution does not compete against fuel cells from manufacturers utilizing other fuel cell technologies.
 Our distributed hydrogen solution competes against traditional centralized hydrogen generation as well as electrolyzers used for distributed applications.  Hydrogen is typically generated at a central location in large quantities by combustion-based steam reforming and then distributed to end users by diesel truck.  Besides utilizing tri-generation SureSource plants for distributed hydrogen, electrolyzers can be used that are in essence, reverse fuel cells.  Electrolyzers take electricity and convert it to hydrogen.  The hydrogen can be used as it is generated, compressed and stored, or injected into the natural gas pipeline.  Companies using fuel cell-based electrolyzer technology for transportation applications include NEL and Hydrogenics Corporation.
 Hydrogen is an energy carrier and energy storage utilizing hydrogen is a growing market opportunity that we are pursuing with our SOFC/SOEC technology.  Companies using PEM-based fuel cell electrolyzer technology for storage include Hydrogenics Corporation and ITM Power PLC.  
 Regulatory and Legislative Support
 Distributed generation addresses certain power generation issues that central generation does not and regulatory policy can impact deployment of distributed generation.  Regulatory and legislative support encompasses policy, incentive programs, and defined sustainability initiatives such as Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”).
 Various states and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted programs for which our products qualify, including programs supporting self-generation, clean air power generation, combined heat and power applications, carbon reduction, grid resiliency / micro-grids and utility ownership of fuel cell projects.
 The majority of states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Clean Energy Standards (“CES”) or RPS mechanisms. Under these standards, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible resources. CES and RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s mandate, the definition of eligible clean and renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for CES or RPS compliance. Fuel cells using biogas qualify as renewable power generation technology in all of the CES and RPS states in the U.S., and ten states (Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, West Virginia and Maine) and Puerto Rico specify that fuel cells operating on natural gas are also eligible for these initiatives in recognition of the high efficiency and low pollutants of fuel cells.  Massachusetts has also promulgated regulations that will qualify certain fuel cells under its Alternative Portfolio Standard. 
 
In February 2018, the U.S. Congress reinstated the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for fuel cells and also extended and significantly expanded the existing Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit. The reinstatement of the ITC for fuel cells provided equal access to tax incentives for U.S. fuel cell manufacturers when compared with other clean energy solutions. We believe that the reinstatement of the ITC will help to facilitate market expansion and product deployment by enhancing our competitiveness on projects and encouraging project financing.
 Internationally, South Korea has an RPS to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and develop local manufacturing of clean energy generation products to accelerate economic growth. The RPS is designed to increase new and renewable power generation to 10% of total power generation by 2024 from 2% when the RPS began in 2012.  Eighteen of the largest power generators are obligated to achieve the RPS requirements in their generation or purchase offsetting renewable energy certificates.  Financial penalties are levied by the government for non-compliance.
 22


Government Regulation
 Our Company and its products are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Negligible emissions of SOx and NOx from our power plants are substantially lower than conventional combustion-based generating stations, and are far below existing and proposed regulatory limits. The primary emissions from our power plants, assuming no cogeneration application, are humid flue gas that is discharged at temperatures of 700-800° F, water that is discharged at temperatures of 10-20° F above ambient air temperatures, and CO2 in per kW hour amounts that are much less than conventional fossil fuel central generation power plants due to the high efficiency of fuel cells. The discharge of water from our power plants requires permits that depend on whether the water is to be discharged into a storm drain or into the local wastewater system.
 We are also subject to federal, state, provincial and/or local regulation with respect to, among other things, emissions and siting. In addition, utility companies and several states in the U.S. have created and adopted, or are in the process of creating, interconnection regulations covering both technical and financial requirements for interconnection of fuel cell power plants to utility grids. Our power plants are designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in international markets in which we operate.  Our SureSource solutions are CARB 2007 certified, and our SureSource 1500, when operating on biogas, is certified for the CARB 2013 biogas standards. 
 We are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our employees, and we are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures.  All of our employees must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations, consistent with our work practices, training and procedures, and consistent with all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.
 Proprietary Rights and Licensed Technology
 Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets and institutional knowledge that we believe is a competitive advantage and represents a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors.  Our Company was founded in 1969 as an applied research company and began focusing on carbonate fuel cells in the 1980s, with our first fully commercialized SureSource power plant sold in 2003. Over this time, we have gained extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power plants.  This experience cannot be easily or quickly replicated and, combined with our trade secrets, proprietary processes and patents, safeguards our intellectual property rights.
 As of October 31, 2018, our Company, excluding its subsidiaries, had 93 patents in the U.S. and 137 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our SureSource technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology, and applications thereof. As of October 31, 2018, we also had 54 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 125 pending in other jurisdictions.  Our U.S. patents will expire between 2019 and 2036, and the current average remaining life of our U.S. patents is approximately 9.0 years.
 Our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Ltd., as of October 31, 2018, had 36 U.S. patents and 76 international patents covering the SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with an average remaining U.S. patent life of approximately 6.3 years.  As of October 31, 2018, Versa Power Systems, Ltd. also had three pending U.S. patent applications and 14 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions.  In addition, as of October 31, 2018, our subsidiary, FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, had license rights to two U.S. patents and seven patents outside the U.S. for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.
 No patents expired in 2018 that would have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations.  Three patents are expiring in 2019, but none of these expirations are expected to have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations.  As has historically been the case, we are continually innovating and have a significant number of invention disclosures that we are reviewing that may result in additional patent applications.
 23


Certain of our U.S. patents are the result of government-funded research and development programs, including our DOE programs. U.S. patents we own that resulted from government-funded research are subject to the government potentially exercising “march-in” rights. We believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government exercising these rights is remote and would only occur if we ceased our commercialization efforts and there was a compelling national need to use the patents.
 Significant Customers and Information about Geographic Areas
 We contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development contracts. For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our top customers, Hanyang Industrial Development Co., Ltd, Clearway Energy (formerly NRG Yield, Inc.), AEP Onsite Partners, LLC, the U.S. Department of Energy, ExxonMobil, POSCO Energy, Dominion Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC and Avangrid Holdings accounted for an aggregate of 84%, 78% and 75%, respectively, of our total annual consolidated revenue.

See Item 7 – “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 – “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information regarding our revenue and revenue recognition policies.
 We have marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. We source raw materials and BOP components from a diverse global supply chain.  In 2018, the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was South Korea, accounting for 41% of our consolidated net sales.  The Company is entitled to receive royalties from POSCO Energy on the sale of power plants and module replacements related to service of fuel cell power plants in Asia.  As part of our strategic plan, we are in the process of diversifying our sales mix from both a customer specific and geographic perspective. See Item 1A: Risk Factors - “We are substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,” “We depend on strategic relationships with third parties, and the terms and enforceability of many of these relationships are not certain,” and “Recent developments with POSCO Energy may limit our efforts to access the South Korean and Asian markets and could expose us to costs of arbitration or litigation proceedings.”
 The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A: Risk Factors – “We are subject to risks inherent in international operations.” See also Note 15 “Segment Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. See also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for other information about our operations and activities in various geographic regions.

Sustainability
 FuelCell Energy’s ultra-clean, efficient and reliable fuel cell power plants help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly products support the “Triple Bottom Line” concept of sustainability, consisting of environmental, social and economic considerations. In October 2018, we were certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant, having demonstrated the establishment of and adherence to an environmental management system standard.  FuelCell Energy is the only fuel cell manufacturer to have received this certification.
 Product efficiency
 The electrical efficiency of our fuel cell solutions ranges from approximately 47% to 60% depending on the configuration.  This compares favorably to the average efficiency of the U.S. electrical grid of about 40%.  Our solutions deliver this high electrical efficiency where the power is used, avoiding transmission.  Transmission line losses average about 5% for the U.S. grid, which represents inefficiency and is a hidden cost to ratepayers.  In a combined heat and power configuration, total thermal efficiency of our fuel cell solutions can potentially be up to 90% depending on the application.
 Energy management
 We utilize our fuel cells to provide a portion of the electricity used at our corporate headquarters and at our North American manufacturing facility.
 Other examples of energy management include routing excess heat from production processes throughout the manufacturing facility to reduce both heating costs and associated emissions, utilizing the power produced by fuel cells undergoing R&D at our facilities for a portion of the power needs of the facilities, and installation of high efficiency lighting at our North American manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters.
 We have expanded our manufacturing facility in Torrington and consolidated other locations, reducing transportation emissions and transportation costs, incorporating energy efficient building standards and reducing leasing costs.  We are relocating fuel cell module conditioning to Torrington from our Danbury facility, which will further reduce transportation emissions and costs. We recognize that there is more to be done and we are utilizing cross-functional teams to identify and evaluate additional areas for improvement.
 Product end-of-life management
 We continue to incorporate sustainability best practices into our corporate culture and into the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our fuel cell power plants.  For example, at the end-of-life of our power plants, we refurbish and re-use certain parts of the power plant and we are able to recycle most of what we cannot re-use.  Some of the parts in the fuel cell module can be re-furbished, such as end plates, while the individual fuel cell components are sent to a smelter for recycling. The BOP has an operating life of twenty to twenty-five years, at which time metals such as steel and copper are reclaimed for scrap value.  By weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant is either re-used or recycled.
 Our manufacturing process has a very low carbon footprint, utilizing an assembly oriented production strategy.  While we continue to enhance and adopt sustainable business practices, we recognize this is an ongoing effort with more to be accomplished, such as further reducing the direct and indirect aspects of our carbon footprint. 
 Workforce Health & Safety
 We work to continually improve what we feel is a robust safety program.  This is demonstrated by an improving safety trend over each of the past 5 years.  We have never had a workplace fatality at any of our facilities or power plant installations.
 25


Sustainability also incorporates social risks and human rights and we will not knowingly support or do business with suppliers that treat workers improperly or unlawfully, including, without limitation, those that engage in child labor, human trafficking, slavery or other unlawful or morally reprehensible employment practices.  We are continuing to implement comprehensive monitoring of our global supply chain to eliminate social risks and ensure respect for human rights. We contractually ensure that all qualified domestic suppliers in our supply chain comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.  
 Materials sourcing
 Assuring the absence of conflict minerals in our power plants is a continuing initiative.  Our fuel cells, including the fuel cell components and completed fuel cell module, do not utilize any 3TG minerals (i.e. tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) that are classified as conflict minerals.  We do utilize componentry in the BOP such as computer circuit boards that utilize trace amounts of 3TG minerals. For perspective, total shipments in fiscal year 2017 weighed approximately 3.0 million pounds, of which 2.5 pounds, or 0.000084%, represented 3TG minerals, so the presence of these minerals is minimal.  Our conflict mineral disclosure filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Form SD contains specific information on the actions we are taking to avoid the use of conflict minerals.
 Associates
 As of October 31, 2018, we had 489 full-time associates, of whom 210 were located at the Torrington manufacturing plant, 242 were located at the Danbury, Connecticut facility or other field offices within the U.S., and 37 were located abroad. None of our U.S. associates are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe our relations with our associates are good.
Available Information
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website (http://www.fuelcellenergy.com) as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
