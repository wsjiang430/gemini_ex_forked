Item 1. Business
Overview
Rapid7 is a leading provider of cyber security analytics and automation, and a driving force behind the growing practice of SecOps. SecOps is the practice of aligning cyber security, IT, and DevOps teams so that security becomes an integral part of these teams’ daily operations to empower organizations to innovate faster and more securely. As of December 31, 2018, over 7,800 organizations around the world trust Rapid7 to provide visibility, analytics and automation to help reduce risk, simplify cyber security and deliver better security outcomes.
Organizations of all sizes are faced with a more sophisticated and motivated set of cyber attackers. Coupled with an increasingly complex IT environment and expanding attack surface, driven by ubiquitous connectivity, globalization, mobility and expansion to the cloud, security and IT teams are struggling to maintain adequate levels of cyber security, provide visibility to their management teams, and meet increasing regulatory requirements. At the same time, they must navigate a shortage of capable cyber security professionals.
Out of these challenges there is a growing need for cyber security, IT and DevOps teams to be better aligned and to work together to identify, manage and reduce risk and more nimbly adapt to emerging threats, without adding significant resources. This need is the foundation of the evolving SecOps movement. SecOps requires shared visibility into risk and priorities, and analytics and automation that enable IT, Security and DevOps to work together to achieve significantly higher levels of productivity and success. Rapid7 is providing solutions to power SecOps success.
Our mission is to advance security through technology and expertise that simplify the complex. We seek to remove friction from every aspect of customers’ security environment, making security achievable and allowing them to focus on their professional and organizational advancement.
As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 7,800 customers, including 53% of the organizations in the Fortune 100. We have experienced strong revenue growth with revenue increasing from $76.9 million in 2014 to $244.1 million in 2018. 
In 2018, 81% of our revenues (under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606)) and 79% of our revenues (under FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605)) were recurring revenues compared to 70% in 2017 under ASC 605. We incurred net losses of $55.5 million, $45.5 million and $49.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we continued to invest for long-term growth. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our adoption, as of January 1, 2018, of ASC 606.

To complement our SecOps products, we offer a range of managed services based on our software solutions and consulting services, including incident response services, security advisory services, and deployment and training.
Insight Platform
Our cloud-native Insight Platform is at the core of our SecOps product offerings. The platform was built using our extensive experience in collecting and analyzing data to enable our customers to create and manage analytics-driven cyber security risk management programs. By utilizing our powerful, proprietary analytics to assess and understand the context and relationships around users, IT assets and cyber threats within a customer’s environment, our solutions can provide our customers with specific, actionable insights for reducing cyber risk, stopping attacks, and improving productivity and outcomes. 
Insight Platform Features and Benefits:
Holistic Dataset for Managing Cyber Security and Driving SecOps: We designed the Rapid7 Insight Platform to allow customers to collect their data once and leverage that same data across multiple solutions, providing shared visibility across teams, improved and automated workflows, and reducing time to value for additional solutions. Our robust data collection architecture supports gathering a wide swath of operational data from endpoints to the cloud, including key data about assets and user-specific behavior, into a unified, searchable dataset.
Agentless and Agent-Based Architecture: We developed our platform with flexible processing technologies that employ both agentless data collection and our own internally-developed endpoint agent technology, which enables rapid and seamless integration of our products into our customers’ modern IT environments and provides security and IT professionals with instant visibility into their dynamic and rapidly-expanding IT ecosystem.
Fast Search: Our search technology enables IT and security professionals to search across their entire IT environment including endpoints and, unlike other machine search solutions, provides live access without having to wait for lengthy indexing processes.
Extensive Behavioral Analytics: Our Insight Platform incorporates extensive UBA and ABA to provide rapid context around users, attackers and assets involved in an incident, enabling organizations to more quickly respond to, contain and mitigate breaches. Our platform incorporates comprehensive UBA to create a behavior profile for each user and correlates every event with a user, asset or application to detect compromised credentials, lateral movement and other malicious behavior. It also uses ABA which incorporates threat intelligence curated from our security operations centers (SOCs) to find unknown variants of validated attacker behavior and creates actionable detections earlier in the attack chain. With our cloud platform, new detections can be made available to customers instantly.
Built-in, Code-less Automation: Our SOAR capabilities are not only offered stand-alone in our InsightConnect product, but are also available as a platform service that is directly built-in to other Insight Platform products to enable customers to quickly and easily automate common tasks. For example, InsightVM leverages embedded workflows for automated assisted patching and containment, allowing security and IT teams to quickly respond to high urgency vulnerabilities. With our embedded workflows, users of InsightIDR can automatically contain a compromised user or asset, saving precious time when an incident occurs.
Robust Platform and Customer Data Security: We designed our Insight Platform to provide a secure environment for our customers data. We deploy a variety of technologies and industry-leading practices that are designed to help ensure that the data collected from a customer’s environment remains proprietary, secure and operational.
Enterprise-Grade Scalability and Extensible Modern Platform: Our Insight Platform provides a high level of scalability. We leverage on-premise deployment models and cloud technologies to achieve a scalable solution delivery model with a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Our technology platform provides a rich set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, and services that enable customers, partners and developers to import and export data and utilize our actionable threat intelligence and deception capabilities.

Sources of Revenue and Transition to Subscription
We derive our revenue primarily from subscription and support fees for our products, and services. We also derive revenue from related professional services.
Last year, we accelerated our transition from a traditional perpetual license business model to a subscription business model. Under a subscription, customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software. A transition to a subscription business model has benefits for us and our customers. Compared to perpetual licenses, subscription-based licenses generally allow our customers to make smaller upfront investment, provide them with the flexibility to adjust capacity every year and eliminate the need for extensive infrastructure to support installation or maintain our products. We benefit from a more predictable, recurring stream of revenue. As customers make a shift from paying upfront for the use of software in the perpetual model to the new subscription model where they pay over time, reported revenue and cash flow may be lower in the short term when compared to the historical perpetual model. However, overtime we expect this business model transition to increase the life-time value of our customers.
Generally, we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term. Our professional services revenue are derived from service contracts that are on a time and materials or fixed fee basis.
In 2018, recurring revenue, defined as revenue from term software licenses, content subscriptions, managed services, cloud-based subscriptions and maintenance and support, was 81% of total revenue under ASC 606 and 79% of total revenue under ASC 605. In 2017 and 2016, recurring revenue was 70% and 67% respectively, of total revenue under ASC 605.
Sales, Customer Support, and Marketing
We sell our solutions through direct inside and field sales team and indirect channel partner relationships.
Sales: Our sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition as well as up-selling and cross-selling additional offerings to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia Pacific, or APAC, as well as by target organization size. Our sales team consists of a mix of inside sales and field sales professionals that sell to small, medium and large enterprise customers. Our highly technical sales engineers help define customer use cases, manage solution evaluations and train channel partners.
We maintain a global channel partner network that complements our sales organization, particularly in EMEA, APAC and Latin America. We have established strong co-sell relationships with strategic channel partners, who provide additional leverage through customer acquisition, deal execution and providing value in securing renewals. We continue to invest in partner models that enable us to create long term customer value. 
We generated 39%, 37%, and 37% of sales from channel partners, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our revenue is not concentrated with any individual channel partner. No channel partner represented more than 10% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Customer Support: Our customer support organization is responsible for providing technical support to our customers acquired directly and through channel partners. We believe that a dedicated support team is essential to a successful customer deployment and ongoing experience, as well as overall customer satisfaction.

The community also provides us with near real-time visibility into new cyber attacks as they occur and a deep understanding of attacker behaviors.
We perform industry leading security research that enables the analytics in our platform and products as well as delivers strategic value to the security community at large. The output of our research results in threat intelligence, exposure analysis and attacker awareness that we publish as well as integrate into our platform. This data is used for security research, product development, and across our services to help protect and inform our customers, partners and community. We share this data with validated educational and private security researchers, research partners, vetted threat sharing communities, and organizational security teams through our Open Data portal to foster collaboration and encourage discovery of new insights. We collect data for research purposes through two key areas:
Attacker Intelligence: We collect data from across the internet through a variety of honeypots distributed both geographically and across IP space. The honeypots collect many data types and is then analyzed to help enhance our understanding of attacker methods.
Internet Intelligence: We conduct internet-wide scans across many services and protocols to gain insight into global exposures and vulnerabilities.
This data collected is analyzed for the purpose of analytics in our platform and results in core research reports. We publish a variety of reports including The National Exposure Index, The Industry Cyber Exposure Report and Under the Hoodie. The National Exposure Index, published annually, is a census report that highlights the state of exposed internet services at the nation-state level and provides key trending information on the use of insecure protocols. The Industry Cyber Exposure Index details the attack surface, insecure service presence, email safety configurations, malware infection rates and internet supply-chain risks of Fortune 500 companies. The Under the Hoodie report sheds light on the art of penetration testing by revealing not just the process, techniques and tools that go into it, but also revealing the real-world experience of our engineers and investigators, gathered over thousands of penetration tests.
Our Customers
Our customer base has grown from approximately 3,733 customers at the end of 2014 to more than 7,800 customers as of December 31, 2018, in 131 countries, including 53% of the organizations in the Fortune 100. We define a customer as any entity that has (1) an active Rapid7 contract or a contract that expired within 90 days or less of the applicable measurement date; and for Logentries products, those customers with a contract value equal to or greater than $2,400 per year, or (2) purchased Rapid7 professional services within the 12 months preceding the applicable measurement date.

7

Our revenue is not concentrated with any individual customer and no customer represented more than 2% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Our Competition
The markets we operate in are highly competitive, fragmented and subject to technology change and innovation. Our primary competitors in Vulnerability Management include Qualys and Tenable; in Incident Detection and Response (SIEM) include Splunk, Micro Focus and LogRhythm; in Application Security include Micro Focus and IBM; in Security Orchestration and Automation Response include Phantom (Splunk) and Demisto; and finally, while the competition in our professional services business is diverse, our competitors include FireEye’s Mandiant, SecureWorks and NCC Group.
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:

• | product functionality;


• | breadth of offerings;


• | performance;


• | brand name, reputation and customer satisfaction;


• | ease of implementation, use and maintenance;


• | total cost of ownership; and


• | scalability, reliability and security.

Certain of our competitors have greater sales, marketing and financial resources, more extensive geographic presence or greater brand awareness than we do. We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from emerging companies. In addition, we expect that there is likely to be continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition.
Intellectual Property
Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and other contractual protections to protect our intellectual property in the United States and other jurisdictions.
We have numerous issued patents and a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and have a number of patent applications pending. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot be sure that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solution. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Certain of these third parties have made claims of infringement against us in the past and third parties may make claims of infringement against us in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,246 full-time employees, including 247 in product and service delivery and support, 519 in sales and marketing, 324 in research and development and 156 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2018, we had 
8

912 full-time employees in the United States and 334 full-time employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
