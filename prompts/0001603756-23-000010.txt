Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a global medical technology company that is developing and commercializing novel products for adults with bladder and bowel dysfunction, including: (i) implantable SNM systems to treat urinary urge incontinence (UUI) and urinary urgency frequency (UUF), together referred to as overactive bladder (OAB), as well as fecal incontinence (FI), and non-obstructive urinary retention (UR); and (ii) a urethral bulking agent (Bulkamid) to treat female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). 
SNM Systems
Our newly developed rechargeable SNM system, Axonics R20, is designed to last 20 or more years in the human body and is only 5cc in volume. R20 provides constant current stimulation and offers broad MRI access with 
1.5T and 3.0T scanners. R20 utilizes an easy-to-use, intuitive patient remote control and requires recharging for only one hour every 6 to 10 months, which is the longest interval between recharging among rechargeable SNM systems. The R20 replaces the previous rechargeable SNM system offered by Axonics that was the first to be marketed worldwide.
Our recharge-free SNM system, Axonics F15, utilizes a primary cell battery with an expected life of 15 years at typical stimulation parameters and over 20 years at lower amplitude settings. The recharge-free implantable neurostimulator (INS) is approximately 10cc in volume, utilizes constant current stimulation, a recharge-free patient remote control and offers broad MRI access.
We began U.S. commercialization in the middle of the fourth quarter of 2019 after receiving premarket approval (PMA) of our first rechargeable SNM system by the FDA. We also have marketing approvals from regulators in Europe, Canada, and Australia for all relevant clinical indications.
SNM therapy has been commercially available in the United States for over 20 years and has been clinically proven to provide a safe, effective, reversible, and long-lasting symptom relief. We believe that our SNM systems offer therapeutic benefits and competitive advantages compared to the InterStim SNM systems offered by Medtronic. As a result of the longevity of our implantable devices, patients implanted with our SNM systems do not need to undergo replacement surgery every three to five years, as was the case for patients implanted with legacy non-rechargeable InterStim SNM systems.
We engineered our SNM systems to deliver constant-current stimulation, which automatically adjusts stimulation based on changes to impedance that occur as the implanted lead scars into the body, which we believe provides a more consistent therapy over time and reduces management of the therapy. Our SNM systems include an easy-to-use wireless patient remote control that does not require recharging or replacement batteries. We also designed and custom built a clinician programmer that guides the implanting physician through lead placement and stimulation programming.
We continue to invest in research and development activities to expand our suite of products for SNM therapy. In March 2022, we received FDA approval for the Axonics F15, a long-term, recharge-free SNM system. In January 2023, we received FDA approval for the Axonics R20, our fourth-generation rechargeable SNM system.
We focus most of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for SNM therapy is well-established and covered by most major U.S. insurers, including Medicare.
Urethral Bulking Agent
On February 25, 2021, we acquired Contura Limited (Contura) and its Bulkamid product, a urethral bulking hydrogel indicated for the treatment of female SUI.
SUI is a common condition that afflicts women of all ages, with childbirth as one of the main contributing factors. SUI is caused by weakness in the pelvic floor, preventing the urethra from closing fully when sudden pressure is put on the bladder. This can allow urine to leak out during normal daily activities such as coughing, laughing, exercising, or lifting an object. 
Bulkamid received a Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark in 2003 and a PMA from the FDA in 2020 and is sold through a combination of a direct sales force in the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries and distributors in certain international markets.
As a next-generation bulking agent, we believe Bulkamid addresses the shortcomings of legacy particulate-based bulking agents. It is a unique and patented non-particulate hydrogel that is injected into the urethral wall to restore the natural closing pressure of the urethra. It is a simple, quick, and easy-to-learn and perform procedure that can be performed in either a physician’s office or an outpatient facility.
Bulkamid is biocompatible, consisting of 97.5% water, and does not induce a chronic inflammatory response. Bulkamid’s bulking effect is aided by the volume of each injection being predictable, controllable, and precise. Bulkamid retains its bulking characteristics for a number of years, thereby maintaining efficacy and providing women with long lasting relief of their SUI symptoms. Bulkamid is clinically validated and generates high rates of patient satisfaction.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a global leader in providing effective and long-term solutions to treat incontinence. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:
•Continue to promote awareness of our SNM systems among healthcare providers. We believe that of the approximately 45,000 physicians addressing OAB and FI in the United States, approximately 2,000 or less than 5% are actively performing SNM procedures. We intend to help physicians in their direct-to-patient outreach and are pursuing Axonics-sponsored direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives. We believe this will increase the number of patients seeking treatment and ultimately undergoing SNM procedures.
•Continue to develop a commercialization infrastructure with a dedicated direct sales team. We focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States since we believe that approximately 90% of the annual global SNM sales are generated in this market. To achieve our commercialization goals, we plan to continue to provide our sales representatives and clinical specialists with sufficient resources to achieve success.
•Continuously innovate to introduce enhanced SNM product offerings. We continue to invest in research and development activities to expand our suite of products for SNM therapy. In March 2022, we received FDA approval for the Axonics F15. In January 2023, we received FDA approval for the Axonics R20, our fourth-generation rechargeable SNM system.
•Further penetrate our initial target market by promoting patient and practice awareness. Currently, we estimate that less than three percent of patients worldwide that could benefit from SNM therapy have been implanted with an SNM device. We believe that there are several factors that influence this low historical penetration of the potential market. First, even after patients were made aware of SNM therapy by a physician, many patients elected not to undergo the procedure due to the limitations of the legacy product, such as the need for multiple INS replacement surgeries and the large device size. Second, we believe there is a large number of adults with OAB and/or FI symptoms that are unaware of SNM therapy. Third, we believe that more physicians should offer SNM to their patients. We intend to educate physicians that are unfamiliar with the benefits of SNM therapy and the attractiveness to patients of our SNM systems. We intend to increase physician and patient awareness through engagement, direct patient outreach, presentation of clinical data at medical conferences and publication of clinical data in peer reviewed journals.
•Expand our product offerings with complementary products in our market. We believe our acquisition of Bulkamid is highly synergistic and positions us to become a global leader in incontinence solutions. We have been able to leverage our existing commercial footprint of sales and clinical specialists in the United States and Europe who call on urogynecologists and urologists for SNM, the same type of physicians who treat SUI. We also believe that extending our urology platform to offer solutions for both OAB and SUI will enhance our value proposition and drive additional SNM sales.
Our Markets
The market for SNM therapy is large and growing. Our SNM target market consists of millions of adults in the United States and Europe with symptoms of UUI, UUF, FI, and UR who have progressed through the care pathway and are eligible to be treated with SNM therapy.
We believe that the U.S. SNM market is now approximately $800 million, representing approximately 52,000 annual patient implants. We believe the SNM market will continue to increase for the foreseeable future driven by increased awareness and education of SNM therapy, greater expectations for quality of life, and improved patient attitudes toward receiving medical attention. In addition, market growth is anticipated to accelerate due to continued innovation and the introduction of new efficacious and long-lived products for SNM therapy. We believe that this represents a compelling opportunity for our SNM systems to capture market share and grow the market for SNM therapy.
The market for SUI therapy is highly underpenetrated, with approximately 22 million women in the United States having moderate to severe SUI or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) symptoms, which is urinary 
incontinence related to both stress and urgency. The first-line treatment options for SUI begin with lifestyle changes and continence pessaries. SUI lacks pharmacologic treatments, with patients next advancing to urethral bulking agents, pelvic floor sling surgery or colposuspension. We estimate that less than half of these women have sought medical treatment, most of whom were offered conservative therapy or opted for no treatment due to a lack of non-invasive treatment options with high efficacy.
While we anticipate expanding into other geographic regions over time, we are primarily focusing on marketing our products in the United States and Europe due to the large overall market size.
Overview of Overactive Bladder
OAB causes a sudden urge to urinate that is difficult to stop and often leads to the involuntary leakage of urine. OAB typically presents via a combination of several symptoms, including abnormally frequent urination that is typically defined as urinating more than eight times per day, involuntary leakage of urine, or incontinence, and the disruption of sleep to wake up and pass urine, or nocturia. The combination and severity of OAB symptoms varies from person to person. UUF, when not accompanied by any other symptoms, does not include the involuntary leakage of urine. UUI is characterized by the sudden need to urinate accompanied by the involuntary loss of urine, regardless of frequency. Non-obstructive urinary retention or UR, which is the inability to empty the bladder, is not considered OAB. 
A study published in 2022 by Patel, Ushma J. et al. found that approximately 19 million women in the United States have moderate to severe UUI or MUI symptoms. Study authors utilized publicly available data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics, a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is designed to assess the health status of a nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The study analyzed data from over 5,000 women that completed mobile examinations and computer-assisted personal interviews with standardized urinary incontinence questions.
We believe this survey is representative of the prevalence of OAB in the United States. Obesity and diabetes are frequent risk factors associated with OAB, and we believe that the increase in this high-risk population is one of the factors that has driven continued growth in the prevalence of OAB.
While historically many people with symptoms of OAB have gone undiagnosed, we believe this is beginning to change. We believe that improved access to care, decreased social acceptance of compromised quality of life, and longer life expectancy may all contribute to individuals being more proactive about acknowledging symptoms of OAB and seeking medical attention. Previously, patients have avoided discussing their symptoms with medical professionals because of misperceptions such as OAB symptoms being a normal and accepted consequence of aging, and lack of availability of treatments, misguided fear of the currently available treatments, and general availability of self-management tools, such as incontinence pads. In addition, we believe programs such as the Patient Quality Reporting System (PQRS), which was introduced by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) in 2013, have helped to improve the frequency of dialogue around OAB between physicians and their Medicare patients as it includes incentives and penalties for primary care physicians based on various quality of care metrics, one of which addresses treating UUI symptoms.
The prevalence of OAB between women and men is generally similar, however, it varies by subtype. Women are more likely to suffer from UUI than UUF. In contrast, men are much more likely to suffer from UUF than UUI. Incidence by age also varies between men and women, as women often develop UUI at much younger ages than men. UUI symptoms in women are often associated with childbirth or menopause, while prostate enlargement, which is frequently associated with aging, is a leading cause of UUF symptoms in men. SNM is not indicated for treatment of UUF caused by prostate enlargement. These age and gender differences are significant because they may impact who seeks treatment for symptoms of OAB. Individuals with UUI are more likely to seek treatment due to the impact of incontinence on quality of life, and younger individuals are less likely to dismiss symptoms of OAB as an expected consequence of aging. As a result, women are more likely to seek treatment for symptoms of OAB than men.
Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of OAB can develop due to a variety of underlying causes. When a patient consults a physician for the treatment of their symptoms related to OAB, the physician will first undertake a differential diagnosis in an attempt to determine the underlying cause of OAB.
If the physician is able to identify an underlying cause of OAB, the physician will then attempt to treat the underlying cause and alleviate the symptoms. When the physician is unable to identify an underlying cause of OAB symptoms, the patient is considered to have idiopathic OAB. We believe that these idiopathic patients are some of the best candidates for SNM therapy and where SNM therapy has been clinically proven to alleviate the symptoms associated with OAB.
OAB is associated with a significant economic burden to society. Direct medical and non-medical costs associated with OAB include the cost of diagnostics, pharmacological care, routine care, and OAB-related consequences such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, and depression. Further, indirect costs of OAB include caregiver wages and worker productivity losses resulting either from disability or absenteeism, as well as intangible costs including the quality-of-life impact and psychological burden. According to a study published in the American Journal of Managed Care in 2009, these OAB costs result in a total economic burden in the United States that is estimated to be between $24.9 billion and $36.5 billion.
Before treating patients with a third-line therapy such as SNM, physicians are required to prescribe first- and second-line therapies. As discussed further below, first-line therapies including behavioral changes such as diet and exercise, and second-line therapies include drug therapy. In the United States, in order to secure reimbursement, physicians are required to prescribe, and the patient must fail, or be contraindicated and/or refractory for, up to two second-line drug therapies before beginning SNM therapy, although the course of treatment and its duration may vary patient-by-patient based on physician judgment.
Current Treatments for OAB and Limitations
Patients with OAB follow a care pathway that transitions them, as necessary, through the progressive series of OAB treatment options. The care pathway directs physicians as to the progression of OAB treatments as follows:
•    First-line therapy: behavioral changes, including conservative treatment options such as diet, exercise, timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises, and biofeedback;
•    Second-line therapy: drug therapy, including two classes of OAB drugs, anti-muscarinics and beta-3 adrenergic agonists, with patients often trying multiple drugs; and
•    Third-line therapy: minimally invasive therapy consisting of SNM, BOTOX injections and non-implantable Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS).
First- and second-line therapies comprise the largest segment of the treatment market and are better known to physicians and hospitals than SNM therapy.
First-Line Therapies
First-line therapies represent conservative treatment options. Physicians may recommend that a patient make behavior modifications, such as drinking less fluid, training the bladder and/or pelvic muscles through Kegel exercises, among others. Such treatment options are limited in both duration and effectiveness.
Second-Line Therapies
Second-line therapies consist of medications, which comprise the largest segment of the OAB treatment market. Anticholinergics such as Oxybutynin, Vesicare, Detrol, Oxytrol, Enablex, and Sanctura are the most commonly prescribed medications. However, patients often do not fully comply with their drug prescriptions, due to perceived inefficacy and side effects. Mirabegron and Vibegron are the only available beta-3-adrenergic agonists that targets the bladder muscles and reduces bladder contractions to treat OAB. Physicians may also prescribe Tricyclic antidepressants such as Duloxetine and Imipramine, which are not FDA approved to treat the symptoms of OAB, but have been shown to relax the muscles in the bladder and reduce urgency.
Anti-muscarinic drugs inhibit the activation of muscarinic receptors on the bladder muscle by acetylcholine. Dry mouth is the most bothersome adverse event associated with antimuscarinic drugs and often a reason for treatment discontinuation. Side effects also include blurred vision, photophobia, tachycardia, difficulty in urination, hyperthermia, glaucoma, and mental confusion in the elderly.
Beta3-adrenergic agonists are relatively new drugs for OAB that work by relaxing the bladder muscle in the wall of the bladder by stimulating the beta-3 receptors that are found on the surface of the muscle cells. This 
relaxation of the bladder muscle helps to increase the capacity of the bladder to hold urine. In turn, this reduces the need to pass urine. The most common adverse events observed in clinical trials were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection.
Third-Line Therapies
Sacral Neuromodulation
Medtronic’s InterStim I was approved by the FDA to treat the symptoms of UUI in 1997 and UUF in 1999. InterStim II was approved to treat the symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 2005, and to treat the symptoms of FI in 2011. Medtronic’s InterStim Micro was approved by the FDA in 2020 and InterStim X was approved by the FDA in 2022. These systems have been implanted in hundreds of thousands of patients, with a majority of all implants having taken place in the United States.
BOTOX Injections
BOTOX injections into the bladder muscle were approved for treatment of symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 2013. BOTOX is injected through a cystoscopic procedure in a clinician’s office or the outpatient surgery setting, and BOTOX treats OAB by blocking the signal from the bladder nerves to the bladder muscle. Key adverse events include recurrent urinary tract infections and self-catheterization due to inability to void. BOTOX injections are typically required every six to 12 months to maintain reduction of OAB symptoms. We believe the frequent need for injections and the adverse event profile are deterrents to initial and long-term preference for BOTOX injections, as evidenced by an approximately 60% rate of cessation of BOTOX injections at three years, according to a retrospective study by Mohee et al. 2012.
Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation
PTNS involves in-office placement of an acupuncture needle in a patient’s ankle to deliver electrical stimulation to the tibial nerve. Typically, patients undergo a 12-week trial period of weekly 60-minute PTNS sessions to evaluate whether the therapy provides significant symptom reduction. After this period, patients that continue with the therapy typically require monthly treatments to maintain symptom reduction. Adverse events of PTNS are minimal; however, lack of PTNS efficacy and lack of patient compliance result in PTNS generally providing less long-term effectiveness than SNM and BOTOX injection therapies.
Overview of Fecal Incontinence
FI is the inability to control bowel function, causing involuntary or accidental leakage from the rectum. Stimulation of the sacral nerves can reduce incontinence episodes, urgency, and frequency in people suffering from FI, and is an approved therapy for the treatment of FI in the United States and Europe. Moreover, a significant population of people suffering from FI also exhibit symptoms of OAB. SNM therapy can alleviate symptoms in patients suffering from either or both OAB and FI. Adults with FI that exhibit idiopathic symptoms or experience FI as result of obstetric or surgical injury or other prior trauma can be treated with SNM therapy.
People with FI experience even greater degrees of embarrassment and decreased quality of life than people with OAB. We believe shifting expectations and attitudes toward medical attention suggest this addressable market has the potential to expand.
A study published in 2014 by Ditah, Ivo et al. found that approximately 19 million adults in the United States exhibited symptoms of FI. Study authors utilized publicly available data from the 2005-2010 NHANES sample and based their analysis on over 14,000 adults that completed the FI section of the survey.
Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of FI can develop due to a variety of underlying causes. When a patient consults a physician for the treatment of their symptoms related to FI, the physician will first undertake a differential diagnosis in an attempt to determine the underlying cause of FI. Underlying issues that can cause FI include obstetric injury, inflammatory diseases, prior surgeries, and other issues.
If the physician is able to determine that FI is caused by a clear, underlying disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, the physician will then prescribe a care pathway to treat the underlying disease and alleviate the symptoms. Patients with FI caused by past trauma, mainly from obstetric damage, represent the majority of 
candidates for treatment of FI with SNM therapy. Additionally, in the absence of an identified underlying cause of FI symptoms, the patient is considered to have idiopathic FI.
Our SNM Systems
We believe that our proprietary SNM systems provide a minimally invasive, effective, and long-lasting solution for patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction. We have marketing approvals in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia for all relevant clinical indications.
Our SNM systems include two implantable components and various external components.
    Implantable Components for Patient
•Miniaturized INS, which houses the electronics for the device. The Axonics R20 is the fourth-generation rechargeable SNM system that utilizes an INS that is 5cc in volume and is intended to provide six to ten months of battery life between charges under normal use conditions. The Axonics F15 is a recharge-free SNM system that utilizes an INS that is 10cc in volume and powered by a primary cell battery.
•Tined four-electrode lead, which is implanted next to the targeted sacral nerve and delivers stimulation to the nerve. The tines help anchor the lead in its desired position.
Implantable Neurostimulators
F15 and R20
    External Components for Patient
•Wireless charging device, which allows transcutaneous charging of the Axonics R20 INS. The charger uses an easy-to-understand combination of visual, audio and haptic indicators to provide information about the charging status. Further, it has the ability to be held into position by an adhesive fixation device or a reusable and flexible belt, which significantly enhances patient mobility.
•Wireless remote control that communicates with the device at a range of up to approximately three feet, which is a small and easy-to-use device that allows the patient to adjust stimulation intensity levels, modify program settings and turn stimulation on or off. The remote control includes a light-emitting diode light that indicates therapy intensity and the status of battery life of the INS.
Wireless Charging Device
Patient Remote Control
The implantable components of our SNM systems deliver mild electrical pulses to the targeted sacral nerve, most frequently the S3 nerve, in order to correct the dysfunction by restoring normal communication to and from the brain. The sacral nerves, including the S3 nerve, are located in the pelvic area and are responsible for controlling urethral sphincters, the bladder and anal sphincter muscles. The image below illustrates the location of the two implantable components of our INS and the four-electrode lead:
Benefits of our SNM Systems
We believe that our innovative and proprietary SNM systems offer several competitive advantages as compared to the legacy SNM system, InterStim II. Our SNM systems offer the following important benefits:
•Long-term solution. Our devices are designed to last 15 to 20 or more years, compared to 7-10 years for the InterStim X.
•Material benefits to physicians and payors. We believe our SNM systems have the potential to enable physicians and facilities to utilize their resources more efficiently and significantly reduce overall costs to the healthcare system, due to the need for less replacement surgeries compared to InterStim.
•Small and lightweight implantable neurostimulator. Our rechargeable INS is approximately 60% smaller than InterStim X and our recharge-free INS is approximately 30% smaller than InterStim X.
•Constant current. Our SNM systems deliver constant-current stimulation, which automatically adjusts stimulation based on changes to impedance that occur as the implanted lead scars into the body and we believe provides a more consistent and reliable therapy.
In addition, we believe our SNM systems offer many additional competitive advantages compared to the InterStim product line:
•Improved patient experience. Our SNM systems include a discrete, small and easy-to-use remote control. 
•Simplified therapy programming. Our clinician programmer guides the provider through electrode stimulation programming and enables providers to access key data from the patient’s INS.
•Broad MRI conditions. Our SNM systems allow for 1.5T and 3T full-body MRI scans under broad conditions.
•Clinically proven results. Our rechargeable SNM system with clinical data to support its safety and efficacy. Two-year results from our clinical study show that 93% of patients achieved clinically significant improvements.
Overview of our External Trial System
Our external trial system (ETS) can be used during an evaluation period by a physician to determine if a patient is a good candidate for SNM therapy. This system includes a disposable external stimulation device, a disposable implantable lead, and a patient remote control. The external stimulation device is comprised of a temporary, non-rechargeable, current controlled pulse generator. The temporary implantable lead has a single electrode. In addition, our ETS can be used for a bilateral percutaneous nerve evaluation trial or a tined lead evaluation trial.
Overview of our Physician Tools
We provide physicians with a surgical tool kit to assist them while implanting our SNM systems. Our clinician programmer also allows physicians to connect to a patient’s INS during the implant procedure and at other times to access key therapy data that is stored and maintained on the INS.
    Clinician Programmer
We designed and custom built our touchscreen clinician programmer. The INS is programmed by and wirelessly communicates with the clinician programmer. This programmer is designed to simplify and assist physicians with electrode placement and stimulation programming. It has a series of touchscreens with a graphical user interface that provides information to the physician, such as measured data, test stimulation adjustments, and electrode configurations based on the utilization of proprietary algorithms. Further, it enables the clinician programmer to access any INS data and its complete history. The clinician programmer records and stores all data from the INS and enables a physician to store and retrieve this data electronically.
Clinician Programmer
    Surgical Tool Kit
The single-use surgical tool kit provides the physician with the tools necessary for the SNM implant procedure.
Treatment with our SNM Systems
Patient Selection
SNM therapy is an approved therapy for patients with symptoms of bladder and bowel dysfunction. This therapy is not intended for patients with a mechanical obstruction such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, a tumor, or urethral stricture. Further, the therapy is not indicated for pregnant women or pediatric use.
SNM therapy for bowel dysfunction is indicated for patients who are not candidates for more conservative treatments. The therapy is not indicated for pregnant women or pediatric use.
Implantation
Before receiving an Axonics SNM system, a patient in the United States typically undergoes an external trial period.
    External Trial Period
The short external trial procedure, which typically lasts approximately 30 minutes, is generally performed in the office or outpatient setting and typically involves a percutaneously placed lead, which a physician implants near the targeted sacral nerve using a needle, with the location confirmed utilizing fluoroscopy and intraoperative muscle responses evoked by test stimulation. The lead is then connected to a temporary, disposable external trial stimulator, which provides stimulation for the therapy. The trial period can last between a few days to several weeks after which the physician evaluates the effectiveness of SNM therapy through several measures, including bladder or bowel episodes and patient satisfaction. The vast majority of patients proceed from an external trial to permanent 
implant; the percentage of conversion is dependent on the quality of the implant procedure, external trial type and patient response to the stimulation.
    Permanent Implant
Patients who have undergone a successful external trial period are eligible for a permanent INS implant procedure. The permanent implant procedure typically occurs in an ambulatory surgical center or hospital outpatient setting, usually lasting under an hour, and includes implantation of the INS and, if a temporary lead was used for the trial, implantation of the permanent lead. The INS is inserted through a small incision into a pocket in the subcutaneous fat of the upper buttocks, and the lead body is tunneled to the INS pocket and connected to the INS.
Activation and Programming
Immediately following the implant procedure or within a week thereafter, the patient has their stimulation settings programmed. Stimulation settings are adjusted to ensure they are comfortable to the patient. A reprogramming session may be necessary to achieve and maintain symptom reduction or to address discomfort. After initial programming, a patient has the ability to modify the therapy with the patient remote control.
Our Clinical Results and Studies with our SNM Systems
We have a body of compelling clinical evidence that demonstrates the safety, effectiveness, and sustained benefits of our SNM systems. We have two clinical studies relating to our rechargeable SNM system, a European study, RELAX-OAB, and a U.S. pivotal study, ARTISAN-SNM.
In June 2018, we completed the enrollment and implantation of 129 patients with UUI for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. These patients were evaluated at 14 centers in the United States and five centers in Europe. All patients in our ARTISAN-SNM study reached the two-year post-implant follow-up by August 2020, resulting in completion of the ARTISAN-SNM study.
    Key highlights of our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study at two-years are as follows: 
•113 of the 121 implanted patients completing the two-year visit, or 93%, were therapy responders. Of the 129 patients initially treated, 88% were therapy responders at two years (113 out of 129); 
•93 of the 113 therapy responses, or 82%, had a ≥75% reduction in urgency incontinence episodes;
•94% of patients reported being “satisfied” with the therapy; and
•No serious device-related adverse events have been reported.
Our European RELAX-OAB study began in June 2016 and evaluated 51 patients at seven sites in Europe with OAB subtypes UUI and/or UUF. All patients were evaluated to determine if they were therapy responders, which was defined as showing at least a 50% reduction in the number of average leaks or voids per day or a reduction to less than eight voids per day, in each case on a three-day bladder diary, at various times post-implant. We are following patients out to two years in this study and may follow patients out to five years at selected study sites.
    Key highlights of our European RELAX-OAB study at two-years are as follows: 
•Therapy responder rate for the 37 patients who continued with study follow-up was 90% for test responders and 76% for all implanted patients; 
•93% of test responders and 87% of all implanted patients were “satisfied” with the therapy provided by our rechargeable SNM system; and 
•No serious device-related adverse events have been reported. 
Our Bulkamid Product
Bulkamid is a urethral bulking agent in the form of a non-particulate hydrogel, consisting of 97.5% water and 2.5% polyacrylamide. Bulkamid is injected into the soft tissue of the urethra, adding volume to narrow the lumen of the urethra and to support the closing mechanism of the urethra, thus preventing urine leakage. Urethral bulking does not close the urethra totally; the urethra still opens normally to allow for urination.
Bulkamid achieves its bulking effect by the volume of the gel injected, unlike competitive bulking agents that achieve bulking effect through their micro particles and the body’s inflammatory reaction to the particles.
Over 150,000 women with SUI have been treated with Bulkamid across 25 countries since receiving regulatory approval. During that time, there have been no reported long-term complications or adverse events.
The Bulkamid procedure is minimally invasive, with no cuts or incisions necessary, and typically takes less than 15 minutes. It is a simple procedure that is easy for physicians to learn and is usually performed in a physician’s office or an outpatient facility, typically utilizing a local anesthetic. The injections are made into 3 to 4 locations in the urethral wall; the total volume injected is approximately 2 mL, equivalent to half a teaspoon. The patient is able to return home shortly following the procedure.
The majority of women treated with Bulkamid report dryness or improvement in their symptoms, with many seeing that improvement as soon as they leave the physician’s office, hospital or clinic. Whilst experiencing no leakage at all is the most desired outcome of treatment, many women consider a successful treatment to be a meaningful decrease in the amount and frequency of urine leakage due to SUI such that they can go about their daily activities. If relief from symptoms is not sufficient, an additional injection of Bulkamid (a “top-up” injection) can be given to help achieve desired results. 
In Bulkamid clinical studies, women were asked how effective their treatment was 12 months after their initial injection. Over three quarters of women reported that their incontinence was either cured or improved in one study, while in another study approximately two-thirds of women reported being dry. A Bulkamid clinical study has also shown that most of the women treated over 7 years ago still report a benefit.
Sales and Marketing
We are primarily focused on commercializing our products in the United States, which accounts for the vast majority of sales worldwide. We have established a significant commercial infrastructure, with approximately 140 sales representatives and approximately 185 clinical and therapy support specialists in the United States. We continue to make significant investments to build our commercial organization to market and support our products. When making hiring decisions for these roles, we prioritize individuals with strong sales backgrounds who also have existing relationships with urologists and urogynecologists. We expect to focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for our therapies are well established and covered by most major U.S. insurers, including Medicare. 
Through our specialized and dedicated direct sales organization, we are targeting urologists, urogynecologists and colorectal surgeons, primarily those who have experience performing SNM procedures.
In order to support our direct sales team, our clinical staff is primarily responsible for attending SNM implant procedures and assisting the implanting physician with programming the device. Based on our experience to date, we believe that physicians require minimal training to start implanting our SNM systems.
We are promoting broader awareness of SNM and Bulkamid therapies for the treatment of OAB among patients and physicians, as well as awareness of the benefits and advantages of our products. We have expanded our awareness raising activities, including direct to consumer advertising on Facebook and national television ads, publication of scientific data in peer reviewed journals and education of physicians.
Although our main commercial priority is the United States, in November 2018, we launched a limited commercial effort in Europe. With the addition of the Bulkamid international sales force, we currently have approximately 21 dedicated sales representatives and clinical specialists in the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Canada, and Australia, with distributors serving certain other international markets around the world.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, we derive revenue from the sale of our products to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, which typically bill various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. In addition, we expect that any portion of the costs and fees associated with our SNM systems that are not covered by these third-party payors, such as deductibles or co-payments, will be billed directly to the patient by the provider. Third-party payors require 
physicians and hospitals to identify the product and service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association. As SNM therapy has been widely used in patients for over 20 years in the United States, reimbursement codes and payments are well-established and the procedure is covered by Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans. Similarly, urethral bulking agent treatment reimbursement codes and payments are well-established and the procedure is covered by Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans.
Physician reimbursement under Medicare is generally based on a defined fee schedule (the Physician Fee Schedule), through which payment amounts are determined by the relative value of the service rendered by the physician. Medicare generally provides reimbursement to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers for SNM therapy under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System, respectively, which reimburse to the hospital or ambulatory surgical center, as applicable, a bundled amount generally intended to cover all facility costs related to procedures performed in the outpatient setting. The typical Medicare payment for facility and physician services for an SNM trial and full system implant ranges from approximately $23,000 to approximately $27,000, which covers the cost for the devices and the implantation procedures.
SNM procedures are eligible for payment under existing CPT code 64561 for percutaneous implantation of a lead near the sacral nerve and CPT code 64590 for insertion or replacement of a peripheral or gastric neurostimulator, which includes a neurostimulator for SNM therapy. Reimbursement rates vary based on several factors, including but not limited to the payor, geographic location, the procedure performed, contract terms, the facility in which the procedure is performed and other factors.
Most large insurers have established coverage policies in place to cover SNM therapy. Certain commercial payors have a patient-by-patient prior authorization process that must be followed before they will provide reimbursement for SNM therapy. These processes typically involve the treating physician submitting a form to the payor that provides information about the past treatments provided to the patient that proved ineffective, and the physician’s recommendation that the patient be treated with SNM therapy. Although the prior authorization process can take several weeks, based on our industry knowledge, it generally results in positive coverage determination for these patients.
Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region, particularly based on whether the country or region at issue maintains a single-payor system. SNM therapy is eligible for reimbursement in Canada, Australia and certain countries in Europe. Annual healthcare budgets generally determine the number of SNM systems that will be paid for by the payor in these single-payor system countries and regions. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries or regions may require us to gather additional clinical data before granting coverage and reimbursement for our SNM systems.
Research and Development
We continue to invest in research and development activities to expand our suite of products for SNM therapy. Research and development expenses were approximately $34.4 million, $37.3 million, and $29.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Manufacturing and Supply
We use a combination of in-house and outsourced vendors to manufacture various components of our products. Our contract manufacturers all have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements and are all recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our SNM systems. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with limited capital investment. Certain components used in our products are supplied by single-source suppliers. Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us and test our components and devices to our specifications. We intend to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to enable us to continue our operations while we obtain another supplier in the event that one or more of our single-source suppliers were to encounter a delay in supply or end supply.
We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits. We are required to maintain ISO 13485 certification for medical devices sold in the European Economic Area (EEA), which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations.
We inspect, test, and assemble our products under strict manufacturing processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We perform our own final quality control testing of each product. However, we do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations applicable to our products.
Our suppliers are managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Typically, our outside vendors produce the components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. Our suppliers are audited periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. In addition, we and our suppliers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by U.S. and international regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with quality regulations. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply would be available in a relatively short period of time and on commercially reasonable terms.
For our off-the-shelf components, we do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our third-party manufacturers, and we purchase certain components of our products on a purchase order basis. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of certain components of our products. If our current third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace those manufacturers or expand our in-house manufacturing, which could require significant capital investments. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture these components, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. We believe our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our products for the foreseeable future.
As previously discussed, and pursuant to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, Contura International manufactures all of the Bulkamid that we sell. We have rights to a technology transfer after June 30, 2022 that would enable us to insource the manufacturing of Bulkamid. Under the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, Contura International is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary permits, licenses, approvals and authorizations required for the manufacture and sale of Bulkamid. The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement is subject to certain maximum purchase amounts of Bulkamid, which we believe are sufficient to meet the projected global demand for Bulkamid.
Competition
We believe our products offer several improvements for patients, physicians, and payors.
We consider our primary competition to be implantable SNM devices offered by Medtronic. Medtronic’s InterStim X and InterStim Micro are currently the only other implantable SNM devices approved for commercial sale in the United States by the FDA. We also compete with other third-line treatments, such as BOTOX injections, a product sold by Allergan plc, PTNS, as well as more invasive surgical treatment options, and drugs for the treatment of OAB and FI. We also face competition from Boston Scientific for the treatment of SUI with its bulking agent. In addition, emerging businesses may be in the early stages of developing additional products or therapies designed to treat OAB, FI or SUI.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. 
We own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our SNM systems and several issued patents and patent applications were licensed from AMF in 2013 pursuant to the License Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we own 48 issued U.S. patents and 143 issued foreign patents, and 31 pending U.S. patent applications and 22 pending foreign patent applications. We also license from AMF 30 issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application, as well as 52 issued foreign patents and three pending foreign patent applications. Issued patents owned or used by us will expire between 2023 and 2043.
In addition, we own or have rights to trademarks and domains in the United States and select locations internationally that we use in connection with the operation of our business.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with third party contract manufacturers, suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information that we own or license for use.
AMF License Agreement
On October 1, 2013, we entered into the License Agreement, pursuant to which AMF licensed us the AMF IP relating to AMF Licensed Products.
Under the License Agreement, for each calendar year beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay AMF a royalty on an AMF Licensed Product-by-AMF Licensed Product basis if one of the following conditions applies: (i) one or more valid claims within any of the patents licensed to us by AMF covers such AMF Licensed Products or the manufacture of such AMF Licensed Products, or (ii) for a period of 12 years from the first commercial sale anywhere in the world of such AMF Licensed Product, in each case. The foregoing royalty is calculated as the greater of (a) 4% of all net revenue derived from the AMF Licensed Products, and (b) a minimum annual royalty (the Minimum Royalty), payable quarterly. The Minimum Royalty automatically increases each year, subject to a maximum amount of $200,000 per year. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we have recorded royalties of $3.3 million, $6.3 million, and $4.4 million, respectively.
Government Regulation Applicable to Us
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health & Human Services - Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the CMS, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as comparable authorities in the EEA, Australia, and Canada. These government authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry. Our products are subject to regulation as a medical device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA, Australia, and Canada governing clinical studies and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. We will be required to obtain authorization under appropriate regulatory authorities in countries outside the United States before commencing clinical studies and to obtain marketing authorization or approval before we can commercialize our product in those countries, whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Devices for which there is no predicate device and which therefore are not eligible for 510(k) review, but project a low-to-moderate risk may be eligible for the de novo review process.
Our SNM systems are Class III devices and as such, we obtained PMA approval to market our devices for the treatment of OAB, FI and UR.
In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. The PMA is typically supported by data from preclinical studies and human clinical studies. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulation (QSR).
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which may affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may require no clinical data or less extensive clinical data than the original PMA or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new supplement or PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Post-market Regulation - United States
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment, registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and various state and foreign laws on reporting remunerative relationships with health care providers;
•the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not have to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•the U.S. False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of a cleared device, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, under which the FDA can order device recalls under certain circumstances and that require manufacturers report to the FDA voluntary field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products or any future product candidates;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to permit the export or import of our products or future product candidates; or
•criminal prosecution.
In addition, other U.S. federal and state government authorities, including but not limited to the DOJ, HHS-OIG, FCC and CMS, have broad enforcement powers and can impose various sanctions under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. False Claims Act, and various other laws. These sanctions could include but are not limited to fines, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, and agreements such as Deferred Prosecution Agreements or Corporate Integrity Agreements, under which we may be required to establish additional controls to ensure compliance.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA and the United Kingdom (U.K.)
Medical devices, other than active implantable medical devices (AIMDs), placed on the market in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) must comply with the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the Directive 93/42/EEC (Medical Devices Directive).
Separately, active implantable medical devices are governed by Directive 90/385/EEC, also known as the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (AIMD Directive). AIMDs are defined as medical devices that rely on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that generated by the body, which are totally or partially introduced, either surgically or medically, into the human body and intended to remain after the procedure. Our rechargeable SNM system, or our internal product, qualifies as an AIMD and must therefore comply with the AIMD Directive, more specifically with the essential requirements it sets out at Annex I.
An overarching essential requirement proscribed under both the AIMD Directive and the Medical Devices Directive is that any device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner.
In addition to the essential requirements set out under both the AIMD and Medical Devices Directives, the European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements, creating a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies the essential requirements.
Under the AIMD Directive, manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I by undergoing a conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed to ensure and declare that the products in question comply with the standards set out in Annex I of the AIMD Directive. In addition, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are separate entities that are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by the governmental authorities of each EU Member State. Manufacturers of AIMDs must make an application to a Notified Body for an assessment of its technical dossiers and quality system. Alternatively, manufacturers can seek approval from the Notified Body that a representative sample of the products it has manufactured satisfies the requirements set out in the AIMD Directive and subsequently ensure and declare that all of its products conform to the standard of the approved sample. This is also known as “type approval.”
Similar requirements for conformity assessment procedures apply under the Medical Devices Directive, which vary according to the type of medical device and its classification. We believe that our external device is categorized as a Class IIa device under Annex IX of the Medical Devices Directive. As such, the conformity assessment procedure requirements for our external device are identical to those detailed above for our internal product under the AIMD Directive.
If satisfied that the AIMD or other medical device conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity (see above). The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be legally placed on and traded within the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the product.
In order to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for their AIMDs and other medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and Annex 7 to the AIMD Directive, as well as standards (if any) which may be imposed by national authorities of EEA states in addition to those set out in Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and Annex 7 to the AIMD Directive (the Directives). Clinical studies for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
The European Parliament adopted the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which is directly applicable in the EEA. This is intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
Starting January 1, 2021, all medical devices sold in the United Kingdom must meet new regulatory requirements due to the U.K.’s departure from the EU or “Brexit.” Among other things, companies must register their devices with the U.K. Medicines & Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and may need to change their product marking and labeling. In addition, if the company is not based in the United Kingdom, it must appoint a 
U.K. Responsible Person to register with the MHRA and assist the company in meeting U.K. regulatory requirements.
U.S. Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
Various U.S. federal and state laws restrict our business practices regarding items of value provided to healthcare providers including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. False Claims Act, and the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, in-kind items, meals, travel, lodging, consulting or research agreements, grants, donations, charitable contributions, free equipment or services, royalty arrangements, stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Recognizing that the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established various “safe harbors,” that if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn and interpreted narrowly. Government authorities may claim that our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities do not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in these safe harbors.
Violations of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties and can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Government authorities may contend that we are liable under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business, if we acted with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases, may apply more broadly.
The U.S. False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act, if a person acts with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard.
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the U.S. False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of any recovery. A violation may result in penalties and provide the basis for exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
Additionally, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires annual reporting of transfers of value to certain healthcare providers by companies whose products are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurate and complete information under the Sunshine Act may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain U.S. states similarly require tracking and reporting of certain transfers of value to healthcare providers and some mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs or, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our operations outside the United States are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an official government action. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their 
foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in Europe, Australia, and Canada, and would be subject to such laws in many other countries in which we might choose to do business.
FCC Regulation
Because our SNM systems include a wireless radio frequency transmitter and receiver, the devices are subject to equipment authorization requirements in the United States. The FCC requires advance clearance of all radio frequency devices before they can be imported into, sold or marketed in the United States. These clearances ensure that the proposed products comply with FCC radio frequency emission and power level standards and will not cause interference.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality and restrict the use and disclosure of personal information, such as patient health information.
For example, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), establishes uniform standards governing the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and requires healthcare providers, called “covered entities”, to maintain certain safeguards to protect the privacy and security of PHI. HIPAA also requires business associates (independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a covered entity) to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity. These agreements require the business associate to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure.
Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines and/or imprisonment.
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits alleging negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards.
In the EU, we may be subject to various laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable individual). We may process personal data of our employees, our customers, and our vendors. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR), the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws supporting aspects of the GDPR and implementing the E-Privacy Directive. Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime, while the GDPR permits EU Member States to implement local legislation to supplement the GDPR, and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
The GDPR is directly applicable in each EU Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. Like the previous Directive, the GDPR requires that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on legal bases for processing set out in the GDPR and local laws, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. In addition, the GDPR also limits the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates). 
The GDPR also imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing. It requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects 
(in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR are significant—€20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our sales, starting in the second quarter of 2020 by significantly decreasing and delaying the number of procedures performed using our rechargeable SNM system, and we expect that the pandemic or any resurgence of cases could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similar to the general trend in elective and other surgical procedures, the number of procedures performed using our rechargeable SNM system decreased significantly as healthcare organizations in the United States and globally, including in Europe and Canada, have prioritized the treatment of patients with COVID-19 or have altered their operations to prepare for and respond to the pandemic. Specifically, substantially all of the procedures using our rechargeable SNM system were postponed or cancelled from middle of March 2020 through May 2020, but order flow began a gradual recovery in May 2020 and continued to improve in the second half of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021. During the second half of 2021 and through the second half of 2022, certain outpatient elective procedures were again postponed or cancelled related to the COVID-19 pandemic and specifically the Delta and Omicron variants, which adversely affected our business during the second half of 2021 and through the second half of 2022. While COVID-19 case volumes appear to be decreasing in the U.S. and certain other countries as a result of higher vaccination rates, the global COVID-19 outlook remains uncertain as new variants emerge.
To protect the health of our employees, their families, and our communities, we have adapted to new and improved methods of conducting business, including restricted access to our offices to personnel who must perform critical activities that must be completed on-site, limited the number of such personnel that can be present at our facilities at any one time, requested that many of our employees work remotely, and implemented strict travel restrictions. These restrictions and precautionary measures have not adversely affected our operations. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed, new variants of the virus may continue to cause additional outbreaks. The full extent of COVID-19’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, and additional protective measures implemented by the governmental authorities, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. However, if the pandemic continues to evolve into a long-term severe worldwide health crisis, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
