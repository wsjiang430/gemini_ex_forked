 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 International Stem Cell Corporation (sometimes referred to herein as “ISCO”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on therapeutic and biomedical product development with multiple long-term therapeutic opportunities and two revenue-generating businesses offering potential for increased future revenue.
 We currently have no revenue generated from our principal operations in therapeutic and clinical product development through research and development efforts. We have generated revenue from our two commercial businesses, anti-aging and research products, of a total of $8.2 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 Our products are based on multi-decade experience with human cell culture and a proprietary type of pluripotent stem cells, “human parthenogenetic stem cells” (“hpSCs”). Our hpSCs are comparable to human embryonic stem cells (“hESCs”) in that they have the potential to be differentiated into many different cells in the human body. However, the derivation of hpSCs does not require the use of fertilized eggs or the destruction of human embryos and also offers the potential for the creation of immune-matched cells and tissues that are less likely to be rejected following transplantation. ISCO scientists have created the first parthenogenetic, homozygous stem cell line that can be a source of therapeutic cells for hundreds of millions of individuals with minimal immune rejection after transplantation. We have facilities and manufacturing processes that we believe comply with the requirements of current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) standards as defined by the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations and promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
 We are developing different cell types from our stem cells that may result in therapeutic products. We focus on applications where cell and tissue therapy are already proven but where there is an insufficient supply of functional cells or tissue. We believe that the most promising potential clinical application of our technology is for neural stem cells (ISC-hpNSC®) for treatment of Parkinson’s disease and potentially other central nervous system disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.
 Our most advanced project is the neural stem cell program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In 2013 we published in Nature Scientific Reports the basis for our patent on a new method of manufacturing neural stem cells which is used to produce the clinical-grade cells necessary for future clinical studies and commercialization. In 2014 we completed the majority of the preclinical research establishing the safety profile of neural stem cells ("NSC”) in various animal species including non-human primates. In June 2016 we published the results of a 12-month pre-clinical non-human primate study that demonstrated the safety, efficacy and mechanism of action of the ISC-hpNSC®. In 2017, we began our Phase I trial of ISC-hpNSC®, human parthenogenetic stem cell-derived neural stem cells for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. This trial involves three groups, each with four patients, with each group receiving an increasing amount of ISC-hpNSC via intracerebral transplantation. Patients are evaluated for 12 months (active phase of the study) with an additional 5-year observational follow-up period to assess safety. We reported 12-month results from the first cohort and 6-month interim results of the second cohort at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting (Neuroscience 2018) in November 2018. In April 2019, we announced the completion of subject enrollment, with the 12th subject receiving a transplantation of the highest dose of cells. There have been no safety signals or serious adverse effects seen to date as related to the transplanted ISC-hpNSC® cells. We announced successful completion of the dose escalating phase 1 clinical trial in June 2021. In terms of preliminary efficacy, where scores are compared against baseline before transplantation, we observed a potential dose-dependent response, with an apparent peak effectiveness at our middle dose. The % OFF-Time, which is the time during the day when levodopa medication is not performing optimally and PD symptoms return, decreased an average 47% from the baseline at 12 months post transplantation in cohort 2. This trend continued through 24 months where the % OFF-Time in the second cohort dropped by 55% from the initial reading. The same was true for % ON-Time without dyskinesia, which is the time during the day when levodopa medication is performing optimally without dyskinesia. The % ON-Time increased an average of 42% above the initial evaluation at 12 months post-transplantation in the second cohort.
 Each of these product candidates will require extensive preclinical and clinical development and may require specific unforeseen licensing rights obtained at substantial cost before regulatory approval may be achieved and the products sold for therapeutic use.
 Additionally, we are subject to various other risks; for example, our business is at an early stage of development and we may not develop therapeutic products that can be commercialized; we have a history of operating losses, do not expect to be profitable in the near future and our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern; and we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our products and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain. Please see the heading “Risk Factors” beginning on page 14.

Frequently Asked Questions
 What are Stem Cells?
 Cells are the basic living units that make up humans, animals, plants and other organisms. Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of cells. First, they can renew themselves for long periods of time. Second, they are unspecialized and under certain conditions can be induced to become cells with special functions such as metabolically active cells of the liver or transparent and protective cells of the eye. Until recently, scientists have worked with two major kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and adult stem cells that each has different properties and characteristics. ISCO has developed a third category of stem cells named parthenogenetic stem cells (the hpSCs mentioned above) that promise to have significant therapeutic advantages relative to these other types.
What are Pluripotent Stem Cells?
 Pluripotent stem cells are able to be differentiated or developed into virtually any other cell made in an organism. Both embryonic and parthenogenetic stem cells are pluripotent. Some scientists are exploring manipulation of adult cells into a potentially pluripotent stage. This type of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells.
What are Embryonic Stem Cells?
 Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos at an early stage of development, typically when they are in a structure of a small number of cells called the blastocyst. Embryonic stem cells are expanded in a laboratory cell culture process. Once cell lines are established, batches of them can be frozen and shipped to other laboratories for further culture and experimentation.
What are Adult Stem Cells?
 An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell found among differentiated cells in a tissue or organ. An adult stem cell can renew itself (generally to a lesser degree than can embryonic or parthenogenetic stem cells) and differentiate to a limited number of specialized cell types. These cells can be isolated from different tissues such as the bone marrow, fat tissue, and umbilical cord blood.
Why are Embryonic Stem Cells Important?
 Human embryonic stem cells are able to differentiate into virtually any other cell in the body and to reproduce themselves almost indefinitely. In theory, if stem cells can be grown and their development directed in culture, it would be possible to grow cells for the treatment of specific diseases.
 An early potential application of human embryonic stem cell technology may be in drug screening and toxicology testing.
The study of human development may also benefit from embryonic stem cell research in that understanding the events that occur at the first stages of development has potential clinical significance for preventing or treating birth defects, infertility and pregnancy loss. The earliest stages of human development have been difficult or impossible to study. Human embryonic stem cells offer insights into developmental events that cannot be studied directly in humans or fully understood through the use of animal models.

What are Parthenogenetic Stem Cells and how are they different?
 Parthenogenetic stem cells are pluripotent stem cells created from unfertilized human eggs through a “parthenogenesis” process. Parthenogenesis requires that an unfertilized human egg be “activated” by chemical, physical or other means. Activation results in a non-viable “parthenote” from which pluripotent parthenogenetic stem cell lines can be derived. The cell lines used by ISCO are human parthenogenetic stem cells. Currently, ISCO owns the largest published collection of human parthenogenetic stem cell lines. Our research is based on perfecting proprietary techniques for deriving stem cells through parthenogenesis that result in stem cell lines that have the same capacity to become all cells found in the human body, but do not require use or destruction of a viable human embryo. Furthermore, parthenogenetic stem cells can be produced in a simplified (“homozygous”) form that enables each line to be an immunological match for millions of people. We do not obtain stem cells from fetal tissue nor does our technology require the use of discarded frozen human embryos.
Why Not Use Stem Cells Derived from Adults?
 There are several approaches now in human clinical trials that utilize adult stem cells. However, these cells have limited availability and limited ability to proliferate in culture as well as risk of genetic mutation. Therefore, obtaining clinically significant amounts of adult stem cells may prove to be difficult.
Why is Stem Cell Research Controversial?
The sources of some types of stem cells cause social and religious controversy. For example, some scientists obtain stem cells from aborted fetal tissue, causing opposition from those opposed to abortion. Another controversial source of stem cells is residual human embryos (from fertilized human eggs) that remain after vitro fertilization procedures and are used to create embryonic stem cell lines.
Is Stem Cell Research Banned in the United States?
 Embryonic stem cell research, in general, is not banned in the United States. Work by private organizations is not limited except by the restrictions applicable to all human research. In addition, Proposition 71 in California, which voters approved in November 2004, specifically allows state funds to be used for stem cell research.
Why Not Use the Currently “Approved” Embryonic Stem Cells Lines?
 Most, if not all, human embryonic stem cell lines in research now have complex (“heterozygous”) immune compositions that are likely to cause the differentiated cells to be rejected by most patients.
Why Not use Adult Cells Reprogrammed to become Pluripotent Cells?
Induced pluripotent cells (“iPSs”) benefit from not being derived from human embryos but may face a number of other limitations such as uncertainty as to which genes are turned on and off. Furthermore, like embryonic stem cells, iPSs have complex (“heterozygous”) immune compositions that are likely to cause the differentiated cells to be rejected by most patients.
Ethical Issues
 The use of embryonic stem cells derived from fertilized human eggs has created an ethical debate in the United States and around the world. However, since no fertilized human eggs are used in creating our stem cells and no human embryo is being created, used or destroyed, we expect that our parthenogenetic stem cells will be more readily accepted in circumstances where there are ethical concerns with using traditional embryonic stem cells.
We also have licensed worldwide rights to use a technology known as Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (“SCNT”) to create human stem cells. The President’s Council on Bioethics, as reported in the publication “Reproduction and Responsibility—The Regulation of New Biotechnologies 2004,” has agreed on a series of recommendations for the use of such technology. Countries such as the United Kingdom have made similar recommendations.
Our Platform Technology
 We have developed a proprietary process based on parthenogenesis for the creation of a new type of stem cell that has shown to exhibit the pluripotency and proliferative benefits of embryonic stem cells yet avoid the use or destruction of fertilized human eggs or embryos. Furthermore, since parthenogenetic stem cells can be created with immunogenetically identical (“homozygous”) chromosome

pairs, each line has potential to be an immune match for tens of millions of patients. If such cells were to be differentiated into functional mature cells they would, theoretically, be universally applicable across a wide range of medical conditions.
 We also hold licenses to three other technologies to create human pluripotent stem cells: SCNT technology (as mentioned previously); a technology that may be useful to create induced pluripotent stem cells (“iPS”); and “single blastomere technology” which uses a single cell obtained from a fertilized blastocyst to create an embryonic stem cell line. Each of these technologies has unique cell therapy applications and provides us with a broad base of technologies from which we can operate in the future.
Our Facilities
 We have built the capacity to manufacture human cells for research use in our research and development (“R&D”) facility in San Diego, California and for preclinical and clinical trials and ultimately for therapeutic use through the completion of our cGMP manufacturing facility in Frederick, Maryland.
Our Products
 Therapeutic Product Candidates
 We are developing different cell types from our stem cells that may result in therapeutic products. We focus on applications where cell and tissue therapy is already proven but where there is an insufficient supply of functional cells or tissue.
We believe that the most promising potential clinical applications of our technology are Parkinson’s disease ("PD”), traumatic brain injury ("TBI”), and stroke. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating neural stem cells from hpSCs as a potential treatment of PD, TBI, and stroke.
 PD: Our most advanced project is the neural stem cell program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In 2013, we published in Nature Scientific Reports the basis for our patent on a new method of manufacturing neural stem cells, which is used to produce the clinical-grade cells necessary for future clinical studies and commercialization. In 2014, we completed the majority of the preclinical research, establishing the safety profile of NSC in various animal species, including non-human primates. In June 2016, we published the results of a 12-month pre-clinical non-human primate study, which demonstrated the safety, efficacy and mechanism of action of the ISC- hpNSC®. In 2017, we dosed four patients in our Phase I trial of ISC-hpNSC®, human parthenogenetic stem cell-derived neural stem cells for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We reported 12-month results from the first cohort and 6-month interim results of the second cohort at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting (Neuroscience 2018) in November 2018. In April 2019, we announced the completion of subject enrollment, with the 12th subject receiving a transplantation of the highest dose of cells. There have been no safety signals or serious adverse effects seen to date as related to the transplanted ISC-hpNSC® cells.
 We announced a successful completion of the dose escalating phase 1 clinical trial in June 2021. In terms of preliminary efficacy, where scores are compared against baseline before transplantation, we observed a potential dose-dependent response with an apparent peak effectiveness at our middle dose. The % OFF-Time, which is the time during the day when levodopa medication is not performing optimally and PD symptoms return, decreased an average 47% from the baseline at 12 months post transplantation in cohort 2. This trend continued through 24 months where the % OFF-Time in the second cohort dropped by 55% from the initial reading. The same was true for % ON-Time without dyskinesia, which is the time during the day when levodopa medication is performing optimally without dyskinesia. The % ON-Time increased an average of 42% above the initial evaluation at 12 months post-transplantation in the second cohort.
 Stroke: In August 2014, we announced the launch of a stroke program, evaluating the use of ISC-hpNSC® transplantation for the treatment of ischemic stroke using a rodent model of the disease. The Company has a considerable amount of safety data on ISC-hpNSC® from the Parkinson’s disease program and, as there is evidence that transplantation of ISC-hpNSC® may improve patient outcomes as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy in stroke, having a second program that can use this safety dataset is therefore a logical extension. In 2015, the Company together with Tulane University demonstrated that NSC can significantly reduce neurological dysfunction after a stroke in animal models.
 TBI: In October 2016, we announced the results of the pre-clinical rodent study, evaluating the use of ISC-hpNSC® transplantation for the treatment of TBI. The study was conducted at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. We demonstrated that animals receiving injections of ISC-hpNSC® displayed the highest levels of improvements in cognitive performance and motor coordination compared to vehicle control treated animals. In February 2019, we published the results of the pre-clinical study in Theranostics, a prestigious peer-reviewed medical journal. The publication titled, "Human parthenogenetic neural stem cell grafts promote multiple regenerative processes in a traumatic brain injury model,” demonstrated that the clinical-grade neural stem cells used

in our Parkinson’s disease clinical trial, ISC-hpNSC®, significantly improved TBI-associated motor, neurological, and cognitive deficits without any safety issues.
 Each of these product candidates will require extensive preclinical and clinical development and may require specific unforeseen licensing rights obtained at substantial cost before any regulatory approval may be achieved and the products sold for therapeutic use.
 Anti-Aging Skin Care Products
 ISCO’s wholly owned subsidiary Lifeline Skin Care, Inc. ("LSC”) develops, manufactures and sells anti-aging skin care products based on two core technologies: encapsulated extract derived from hpSC and specially selected targeted small molecules. As of December 31, 2022, LSC’s products include:
 •ProPlus Advanced Defense Complex
 •ProPlus Advanced Recovery Complex
 •ProPlus Eye Firming Complex
 •ProPlus Neck Firming Complex
 •ProPlus Advanced Aqueous Treatment
 •ProPlus Collagen Booster (Advanced Molecular Serum)
 •ProPlus Elastin Booster
 •ProPlus Brightening Toner
 LSC’s products are regulated as cosmetics. LSC’s products are sold domestically through a branded website, Amazon, and ecommerce partners.
Research Products
 ISCO’s LCT subsidiary develops, manufactures and commercializes over 200 human cell culture products. These products include frozen human “primary” cells and stem cells and the reagents (called “media”) needed to grow, maintain and differentiate the cells. LCT’s scientists have used a technique called basal medium optimization to systematically produce optimized products designed to culture specific human cell types and to elicit specific cellular behaviors. These techniques also produce products that do not contain non-human animal proteins, a feature desirable to research and therapeutic markets. These human cell-based products are used domestically and internationally by research scientists in pharmaceutical, academic and government research organizations to study human disease and basic cell biology. LCT’s products eliminate the need for scientists to create their own cells, media and reagents or attempt to adapt “off the shelf” products to match specific experimental needs and they are superior to using animals or non-human animal cells as research tools because they are more relevant to the study of human disease. Strict quality assurance provides a high level of consistency and standardization of these products. LCT offers products that contain no animal products (“called “Xeno-free” products), allowing researchers to have better control of their experiments and to conduct research using products that ultimately can be more appropriate for therapeutic applications.
 Often LCT’s research customers use our cell-based research products in their clinical research, eventually adapting them for therapeutic applications. If one of our research products is adopted by a successful producer of therapeutic cells, ISCO may become a supplier to the much larger therapeutic market through LCT’s products. This is based on the fact that once regulatory product submissions are made to the FDA and similar authorities, the media and reagents used during development cannot be changed easily after approval. These uses of LCT’s products bring opportunities to ISCO for future therapeutic products.
LCT products and applications include:
•Human skin cells and associated reagents for the study of skin disease, toxicology or wound healing. 
 •Human cells from the heart and blood vessels and associated reagents (VascuLife ®), used by researchers to study cardiovascular disease and cancer. 
 •Human bronchial and tracheal cells for the study of toxicity, cystic fibrosis, asthma and pathogenesis. 
 •Human mammary epithelial cells for the study of breast cancer, three dimensional culture and carcinogen screening. 


•Adult stem cells (called mesenchymal stem cells) and the reagents necessary to differentiate them into various tissues, including bone, cartilage and fat. These products are valuable for researchers in the emerging field of regenerative medicine. 
 •Human prostate cells and specialized medium (ProstaLife) to study prostate disease including cancer. 
 •Human renal and bladder cells and associated media (RenaLife) to study renal and bladder diseases. 
 •Human corneal cells and associated media (OcuLife) for the study of corneal disease and as a model of toxicology for consumer product testing. 
 •Human female reproductive system cells (ReproLife) for the study of cellular physiology of the reproductive tract, cellular response to infectious agents and other areas of female reproductive system research.
 •Human Skeletal Muscle Cells (StemLife Sk) for the study of muscle cell biology, diabetes, insulin receptor studies, muscle metabolism, muscle tissue repair and myotube development.
 •An assortment of many other cell culture reagents and supplements for the growth, staining and freezing of human cells. 
 Each LCT cell product is quality tested for the expression of specific markers (to assure the cells are the correct type), proliferation rate, viability, morphology and absence of pathogens. Each cell system also contains associated donor information and all informed consent requirements are strictly followed.
 LCT’s research products are marketed and sold by its internal sales force, LCT brand distributors in Europe and Asia and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) partners, which are then re-branded and sold with OEM partners’ labels.
 Our Markets
 Therapeutic Markets
 ISCO is currently pursuing a number of scientific development programs designed to lead to the creation of new therapeutic products. We anticipate that, with their superior immune-matching characteristics, our cells will be able to reduce or eliminate the need for immune-suppression drugs and the adverse reactions they trigger in patients.
Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease (“PD”) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. According to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, there are more than one million sufferers in the United States with over $2 billion spent on related medication costs. Currently there is no cure for PD and the improvements in symptoms provided by available PD drugs often diminish with time. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating neural stem cells from hpSCs as a potential treatment of PD and potentially other central nervous system disorders, including traumatic brain injury, in order to address this significant market opportunity.
 Traumatic Brain Injury. Over 1.7 million people in North America suffer annually from traumatic brain injury, with associated medical costs exceeding $70 billion. According to the World Health Organization, the global incidence for traumatic brain injury is approximately 10 million people annually. According to the CDC, traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, contributing to about 30% of all injury deaths.
 Anti-Aging Cosmetic Market
Skin care products play a key role in the daily healthcare routines of many consumers. Greater emphasis on advertising, broader and more integrated distribution networks, raising standards of living in emerging markets, and population aging trends in developed nations are the major factors driving the global demand for skin care products.
 The global skin care market is generally comprised of three categories of product -facial care, body care, and special needs products. Top selling products in the facial skincare category include skin brighteners, anti-aging creams and serums, toners, masks, anti-acne and sun protection products.
 Facial skincare products that provide anti-aging benefits represent a significant portion of the global skincare market. Increased longevity leads consumers to seek out high quality, technologically advanced skincare products that can help them maintain a youthful appearance. Anti-aging products that are backed by scientific research remain in high demand among sophisticated consumers despite premium prices.


Research Market
 The research market for cell systems consists of scientists performing basic and applied research in the biological sciences. Basic research involves the study of cell biology and biochemical pathways. Applied research involves drug discovery, vaccine development, clinical research and cell transplantation. The domestic market can be broken into three segments: (i) academic researchers in universities and privately-funded research organizations; (ii) government institutions such as the National Institutes of Health, the United States Army, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and others; and (iii) industrial organizations such as pharmaceutical companies and consumer product companies. It is estimated that the combined academic and government markets comprise approximately 40% of the total market and that the industrial segment comprises approximately 60%. We believe the following are the main drivers in the research market for commercial cell systems:
•The need for experimental human cells which are more predictive of human biology than are non-human cells or genetically-modified cell lines or living non-human animals. 
 •The emerging field of stem-cell-based regenerative medicine and the increase in associated grant money to study stem cells is driving the market not only for stem cell products but also for cell culture products in general. 
 •The desire to lower the cost of drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. We believe that human cell systems may provide a platform for screening toxic drugs early in the development process, thus avoiding late stage failures in clinical trials and reducing costs. 
 •The need to eliminate animal products in research reagents that may contaminate future therapeutic products. 
 •The need for experimental control. Serum-free defined media provides the benefit of experimental control because there are fewer undefined components. 
 •The need for consistency in experiments that can be given by quality-controlled products. 
 •The need to eliminate in-house formulation of media, obtain human tissue or perform cell isolation. 
 •The need to reduce animal testing in the consumer products industry. 
 Intellectual Property
 Patents
 In 2022, ISCO was issued one patent for technology generated by our R&D team. The patent, issued in the USA, covers the use of Parthenogenic Activation of Human Oocytes. As of December 31, 2022, we held a total of 39 patents. These patents expire from June 2025 through June 2037.
 In addition, we have obtained exclusive worldwide licenses to patents and patent applications from Astellas Pharma. We believe that our licensed and internally-generated patents provide the intellectual property rights we need to operate in the pluripotent stem cell field and to progress through the stages of creating a therapeutic stem cell product. These stages include the derivation, isolation, expansion and differentiation of stem cells. The intellectual property available to us enables us to create manufacturing methods that eliminate animal proteins in order to satisfy FDA requirements. In addition, we have rights to sell research products derived through our licensed intellectual property in order to generate income.
The majority of the patents and applications have been filed in the US and in foreign countries through the Patent Cooperation Treaty or by direct country filings in those jurisdictions deemed significant to our operations.
 We have protected our research products and branding through both patents and trademarks. Lifeline Skin Care has filed patent applications covering its proprietary core technologies and methods of using stem cells and targeted small molecules to create skin care products. LSC unique product formulas are protected as trade secrets. ISCO, LCT, and LSC have registered trademarks on their company names, logos and various product names to protect their branding investment. Lifeline Cell Technology’s reagent formulations are protected as trade secrets.
The patentability of human cells in countries throughout the world reflects widely differing governmental attitudes. In the United States, hundreds of patents covering human embryonic stem cells have already been granted, including those on which we rely. Certain countries in Europe and Asia have taken the position that hES cells themselves are not patentable. ISCO believes that such restrictions are not appropriate as applied to parthenogenetic stem cells and is working with patent legislators in Europe to create exemptions for human parthenogenetic stem cells. As a result, we plan to file internationally wherever feasible and focus our research strategy on cells that best fit the US and foreign country definitions of patentable cells and technologies.

On December 18, 2014 the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the European Union’s highest court ruled that the Company’s core technology patent applications are not covered by the prohibition on patenting embryonic stem cells, removing the final barrier to the approval of ISCO’s parthenogenetic stem cell patents in the European Union. This final and definitive ruling by the EU’s highest court now formally separates parthenogenetic stem cells from embryonic stem cells, and removes the exclusion from patentability on the former while maintaining the ban on the later.
 License Agreements
In May 2005, we entered into three exclusive license agreements (“ACT IP,” “Infigen IP,” and “UMass IP” or collectively “ACTC agreements”) with Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas") for the production of therapeutic products in the fields of diabetes, liver disease, retinal disease and the creation of research products in all fields. In February 2013, each of these license agreements was amended and restated, pursuant to which we continue to have rights to Astellas Pharma’s human cell patent portfolio and non-exclusive rights to future developments in the area of diabetes and liver disease, as well as certain rights to patents covering Single Blastomere technology. A significant feature of the licensed Single Blastomere technology is a method of ethically obtaining human embryonic stem cells that allows us to isolate and differentiate hES stem cells directly from a “blastocyst” without harming the embryo. Using other licensed technology, the hES cells can be immediately differentiated into stem cells capable of expansion and differentiation into other types of cells. Under the terms of the amendments we have also acquired additional exclusive rights in the area of parthenogenesis and the use of parthenogenetically derived stem cells for treatment of human diseases.
The agreements with Astellas further provide that we are no longer obligated to make milestone payments or to meet any minimum research and development requirements. We will no longer pay any royalties related to the ACT IP or Infigen IP, and our obligation to pay a minimum license fee for the UMass IP has been reduced to $75 thousand annually, payable in two installments to Astellas.
The agreements continue until the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights. Either party to each amended and restated license agreement may terminate the agreement for an uncured breach or we may terminate the agreements at any time with a 30-day written notice.
Research Agreements
 ISCO actively pursues sponsored research agreements with local and international research organizations and has established research collaborations with collaborators from Yale University, University of South Florida, Tulane University, University of California, San Diego, The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla), and the Sanford Burnham Preby Medical Discovery Institute. We are in frequent negotiations to develop collaborative research agreements with additional domestic and international research organizations from both the public and private sector. These agreements allow us to team up with nationally and internationally known research scientists to study stem cell technologies developed or licensed by ISCO for possible use in therapeutic or research fields. In addition to the research collaborations mentioned above, we provide our stem cell lines to researchers at many universities and other research facilities. Ordinarily, the stem cell lines are provided without charge, but we retain the right to either an exclusive or non-exclusive right to use any technology that may be developed that is necessary in order for us to make therapeutic products based on the research that uses our cells.
Competition
 The development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents for human disease is intensely competitive. Pharmaceutical companies currently offer a number of pharmaceutical products to treat Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, liver diseases, and other diseases for which our technologies may be applicable. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investigating new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the same purposes, which may achieve new efficacy profiles, extend the therapeutic window for such products, alter the prognosis of these diseases, or prevent their onset. We believe that our therapeutic products, when and if successfully developed, will compete with these products principally on the basis of improved and extended efficacy and safety and their overall economic benefit to the health care system. We believe that our most significant competitors will be fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies. Smaller companies may also be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.
Some of our primary competitors in the development of stem cell therapies are BioTime, SanBio, BlueRock Therapeutics, and ReNeuron. Our primary competitors in the skin care market are Obagi, ZO Skin Health, Skinceuticals, SkinMedica (now owned by Allergan), and Murad. In the field of research products, our primary competitors for human cells, media and reagents are Lonza, EMD Millipore, Life Technologies (now owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific), StemCell Technologies, Zen-bio, PromoCell, and Specialty Media. In each of these areas many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and experience than we do.
Sales and Marketing
 To date, sales of our research products have been derived primarily through our in-house sales force and via OEM partners and LCT brand distributors in Europe and Asia. Approximately 45% of our total product sales in 2022 were from one customer.
LSC phased out its retail product line in 2019, with the exception of select cleanser products that were offered to both professional and retail customers. LSC is now offering its ProPLUS product line through its branded website — www.lifelineskincare.com, as well as through a network of select online retailers and a limited number of professional accounts, such as dermatologists, and plastic surgeons. Domestically, we plan to increase distribution of our products through increasing brand awareness, strategic partnerships, and sales promotions.
Government Regulation
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed therapeutic and skin care products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products that we may develop. We anticipate that many, if not all, of our proposed therapeutic products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA, and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted.
We have made extensive progress in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals of research protocols, informed consent documents and donor protection procedures to obtain oocytes in the United States for the production of our parthenogenetic stem cell bank. These approvals include: federally mandated Institutional Review Board (IRB) and State of California required Stem Cell Research Oversight (SCRO) committee.
FDA Approval Process
 Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, pre-clinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as a part of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to establish safety pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, possible dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing; and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA.
 The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing on a non-biologic drug and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In the case of vaccines or gene and cell therapies, the results of clinical trials are submitted as a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). In responding to a NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or refuse to approve if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. There can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.
 In November 2014, in an important ruling the FDA cleared ISCO’s human parthenogenetic stem cells line for investigational clinical use. This was a necessary step in the process of eventually advancing stem cell therapies based on ISCO’s core technology into clinical development. Although the Phase I trial for the Parkinson’s Disease program is anticipated to be conducted in Australia, and therefore not subject to FDA oversight, any future studies will likely be carried out in the United States where this approval is necessary.
In recognition of the challenges that accompany development of cellular therapy (CT) products, the FDA has recently initiated an expedited review and approval process for promising investigational CTs. The first step in the pathway is submission of a request for Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation by the sponsor to the FDA, either at the same time as the initial IND

filing or by amendment to an active IND (prior to the end-of-phase 2 meeting). Upon grant of RMAT designation by the FDA, the sponsor receives access to a number of benefits, the most advantageous of which is early interactions with senior FDA managers for the purpose of discussing potential surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoints to support accelerated approval requirements. Consideration for accelerated approval, heretofore unavailable to regenerative medicine products, represents a major regulatory advance because it would enable ISCO to market ISC-hpNSC earlier than would be possible through the traditional approval process.
 European and Other Regulatory Approval
 Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries will likely be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (“EU”), Australia and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.
In Australia, the approval process for commencing Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials resides with Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the Human Research Ethics Committee, (HREC). Prior to commencing a clinical trial, a sponsor must submit to TGA a CTX or CTN application and must submit to the HREC a study protocol, an investigator brochure and a template informed consent for such clinical trial. The HREC approval process generally takes four to eight weeks.
Other Regulations
 We are also subject to various United States federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the treatment of oocyte donors, the manufacturing environment under which human cells for therapy are derived, safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.
Other Regulations for Lifeline Skin Care
 The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (“FPLA”) provide the regulatory framework for selling cosmetics. The FFDCA oversees the safety of cosmetics. The FPLA ensures that the labeling is not false or misleading and includes all relevant information in a prominent and conspicuous manner.
Safety and efficacy testing of the products is performed by independent third party testing organization.
