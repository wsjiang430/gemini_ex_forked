Introduction
CRA International, Inc. ("CRA", "the Company", "us", "we", or "our") was incorporated as a Massachusetts corporation in 1965. We are a leading global consulting firm specializing in providing economic, financial and management consulting services. We advise clients on economic and financial matters pertaining to litigation and regulatory proceedings, and guide corporations through critical business strategy and performance-related issues. Since 1965, we have been engaged by clients for our unique combination of functional expertise and industry knowledge, and for our objective solutions to complex problems. We combine economic and financial analysis with expertise in litigation and regulatory support, business strategy and planning, market and demand forecasting, and policy analysis. We are often retained in high-stakes matters, such as multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions, new product introductions, major strategy and capital investment decisions, and complex litigation, the outcomes of which often have significant consequences for the parties involved. These matters often require independent analysis and, as a result, the parties involved must rely on outside experts. Our analytical strength enables us to reach objective, factual conclusions that help clients make important business and policy decisions and resolve critical disputes. Clients turn to us because we can provide highly credentialed and experienced economic and finance experts to address critical, tough assignments, with high-stakes outcomes.
We offer consulting services in two broad areas: litigation, regulatory, and financial consulting and management consulting. We provide our consulting services primarily through our highly credentialed and experienced staff of employee consultants. Our employee consultants have backgrounds in a wide range of disciplines, including economics, business, corporate finance, materials sciences, accounting, and engineering. They combine outstanding intellectual acumen with practical experience and in-depth understanding of industries and markets. To enhance the expertise we provide to our clients, we maintain close working relationships with a select group of renowned academic and industry non-employee experts.
Our business is diversified across multiple dimensions, including service offerings and vertical industry coverage, as well as areas of functional expertise, client base, and geography. We believe this diversification reduces our dependence on any particular market, industry, or geographic area.
We provide consulting services to corporate clients and attorneys in a wide range of litigation and regulatory proceedings, providing high-quality research and analysis, expert testimony, and comprehensive support in litigation and regulatory proceedings in all areas of finance, accounting, economics, insurance, and forensic accounting and investigations. We also use our expertise in economics, finance, and business to offer law firms, businesses, and government agencies services related to class certification, damages analysis, expert reports and testimony, regulatory analysis, antitrust and competition matters, strategy development, forensic accounting, information security and privacy matters, labor and employment disputes, transfer pricing issues, valuation of tangible and intangible assets, intellectual property litigation and damages, risk management, and transaction support. In our management consulting services, we use our expertise in economics, finance, and business analysis to offer our clients such services as strategy development, performance improvement, corporate strategy and portfolio analysis, estimation of market demand, ESG and sustainability strategy and analysis, design and implementation of auction and competitive bidding, new product pricing strategies, valuation of intellectual property and other assets, assessment of competitors' actions, and analysis of new sources of supply. Our analytical expertise in advanced economic and financial methods is complemented by our in-depth expertise in specific industries, including communications and media; consumer products, health, and wellness; energy; entertainment and leisure; financial services; healthcare; life sciences; manufacturing and industrials; natural resources; retail and distribution; technology; and transportation.
We have completed thousands of engagements for clients around the world, including domestic and foreign companies; federal, state, and local domestic government agencies; governments of foreign countries; public and private utilities; and national and international trade associations. We also work with many of the world's leading law firms. We experience a high level of repeat business.
We deliver our services through an international network of coordinated offices. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, we have offices throughout the Americas, Europe, and Australia.
Industry Overview
Businesses are operating in an increasingly complex economic, legal, and regulatory environment that create both challenges and opportunities. Companies across industry sectors are seeking new strategies appropriate for the current economic environment, as well as greater operational efficiencies. To accomplish these objectives, they gather, analyze, and use information wisely to assure that business decisions are well-informed. In addition, as markets have become global, companies have the opportunity to expand their presence throughout the world, which can expose them to increased competition and the uncertainties of foreign operations. Further, companies are increasingly relying on technological and business innovations to improve efficiency, thus increasing the importance of strategically analyzing their businesses and developing and protecting new technology. The increasing complexity and changing nature of the business environment are also forcing governments to modify their regulatory strategies. These constant changes in the regulatory environment and the evolving regulatory posture in the U.S. have led to frequent litigation and interaction with government agencies, as our clients attempt to interpret and react to the implications of this changing environment. Furthermore, as the general business and regulatory environment becomes more complex, corporate litigation has also become more complicated, protracted, expensive, and important to the parties involved.
As a result, companies rely on sophisticated economic and financial analysis to solve complex problems and improve decision-making. Economic and financial models provide the tools necessary to analyze a variety of issues confronting businesses, such as interpretation of sales data, effects of price changes, valuation of assets, assessment of competitors' activities, evaluation of new products, and analysis of supply limitations. Governments also rely on economic and finance theory to measure the effects of anticompetitive activity, evaluate mergers and acquisitions, change regulations, implement auctions to allocate resources, and establish transfer pricing rules. Finally, litigants and law firms are using economic and finance theory to help determine liability and to calculate damages in complex and high-stakes litigation. At times, companies and their counsel may require eDiscovery strategies for data preservation, collection, analysis, reporting, and delivery. As the need for complex economic and financial analysis becomes more widespread, companies and governments are turning to outside consulting firms, such as ours, for access to the independent and specialized expertise, experience, and prestige that are not available to them internally. In addition, companies' strategic, organizational, and operational problems have become more acute as a result of the economic environment, and companies are relying on management consultants for help in analyzing, addressing, and solving strategic business problems and performance-related issues involving market supply and demand dynamics, supply chain and sourcing, pricing, capital allocation, technology management, portfolio positioning, risk management, merger integration, and improving shareholder value.
Competitive Strengths
Since 1965, we have been committed to providing sophisticated consulting services to our clients. We believe that the following factors have been critical to our success.
Strong Reputation for High-Quality Consulting; High Level of Repeat Business.    Since 1965, we have been a leader in providing sophisticated economic analysis and original, authoritative advice to clients involved in complex litigation and regulatory proceedings, and we also provide management consulting services to companies facing strategic, organizational, and operational challenges. As a result, we believe we have established a strong reputation among leading law firms and business clients as a preferred source of expertise in economics, finance, business, and management consulting, as evidenced by our high level of repeat business. In addition, we believe our significant name recognition, developed as a result of our work on many high-profile litigation and regulatory engagements, has enhanced the development of our management consulting practice.
Highly Educated, Experienced, and Versatile Consulting Staff.    We believe our most important asset is our base of employee consultants, particularly our senior employee consultants. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 939 consultants, which consisted of 149 officers, 496 other senior staff and 294 junior staff. Approximately 77% of our senior staff have advanced degrees, with 43% of the advanced degrees being doctorate degrees. We are extremely selective in our hiring of consultants, recruiting from leading universities, industry, and government. Many of our employee consultants are nationally or internationally recognized as experts in their respective fields and have published scholarly articles, lectured extensively, and been quoted in the press. In addition to their expertise in a particular field, most of our employee consultants are able to apply their skills across numerous practice areas. This flexibility in staffing engagements is critical to our ability to apply our resources to meet the demands of our clients. As a result, we seek to hire consultants who not only have strong analytical skills, but who are also creative, intellectually curious, and driven to develop expertise in new practice areas and industries.
International Presence.    We deliver our services through an international network of coordinated offices. Many of our clients are multinational firms with issues that cross international boundaries, and we believe our international presence provides us with an advantage to address complex issues that span countries and continents. Our international presence also gives us access to many of the leading experts around the world on a variety of issues, allowing us to expand our knowledge base and areas of functional expertise.
Diversified Business.    Our business is diversified across multiple dimensions, including service offerings, vertical industry coverage, areas of functional expertise, client base, and geography. By maintaining expertise in multiple industries, we are able to offer clients creative and pragmatic advice tailored to their specific markets. By offering clients litigation, regulatory, financial, and management consulting services, we are able to satisfy an array of client needs, ranging from expert testimony for complex lawsuits to designing global business strategies. This broad range of expertise enables us to take an interdisciplinary approach to certain engagements, combining economists and experts in one area with specialists in other disciplines. We believe this diversification reduces our dependence on any particular market, industry, or geographic area. Furthermore, our litigation, regulatory, and financial consulting businesses are driven primarily by regulatory changes and high-stakes legal proceedings. Our diversity also enhances our expertise and the range of issues that we can address on behalf of clients.
Integrated Business.    We manage our business on an integrated basis through our international network of offices and areas of functional expertise. Many of our practice areas operate throughout multiple offices and are managed across geographic borders. We view these cross-border practices as integral to our success and key to our management approach. Our practices share not only staff, but also consulting approaches and marketing strategies. When we acquire companies, our practice is to rapidly integrate systems, procedures, and people into our business platform. In addition to sharing our intellectual property assets globally, we encourage geographic collaboration among our practices by including each consultant's overall contribution to our practices as a factor in determining the consultant's annual bonus.
Diversified Client Base.    We have completed thousands of engagements for clients in a broad range of industries around the world. Our clients are major firms, and national and international law firms representing such clients, across a multitude of industries that include communications and media; consumer products, health, and wellness; energy; entertainment and leisure; financial services; healthcare; life sciences; manufacturing and industrials; natural resources; retail and distribution; technology; and transportation.
Established Corporate Culture.    Our success results in part from our established corporate culture. We believe we attract consultants because of our extensive history, our strong reputation, the credentials, experience, and reputations of our employee consultants, the opportunity to work on an array of matters with a broad group of renowned non-employee experts, and our collegial atmosphere where teamwork and collaboration are emphasized and valued by many clients.
Access to Leading Academic and Industry Experts.    To enhance the expertise we provide to our clients and the depth and breadth of our insights, we maintain close working relationships with a select group of non-employee experts. Depending on client needs, we use non-employee experts for their specialized expertise, assistance in conceptual problem-solving, and expert witness testimony. We work regularly with renowned professors at such institutions as the University of Chicago, the University of California at Berkeley, Yale University, Georgetown University, Boston University, Harvard University, Texas 
A&M University, Brigham Young University, University of Texas-Austin, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other leading universities. These experts also generate business for us and provide us access to other leading academic and industry experts. By establishing affiliations with these prestigious experts, we further enhance our reputation as a leading source of sophisticated economic and financial analysis.
Services
We offer consulting services in two broad areas: litigation, regulatory, and financial consulting and management consulting.
Litigation, Regulatory, and Financial Consulting
In our litigation, regulatory, and financial consulting practices, we typically work closely with law firms on behalf of one or more companies involved in litigation or regulatory proceedings in such areas as antitrust, damages, and labor and employment. Many of the lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in which we are involved are critical assignments with high-stakes outcomes, such as obtaining regulatory approval of a pending merger or analyzing possible damages awards in a class action case. The ability to formulate and effectively communicate powerful economic and financial arguments to courts and regulatory agencies is often critical to a successful outcome in litigation and regulatory proceedings. Our consultants combine analytical rigor with practical experience and in-depth understanding of industries and markets. Our analytical strength enables us to reach objective, factual conclusions that help our clients make important business and policy decisions and resolve critical disputes. Our consultants work with law firms, corporate counsel, and regulatory agencies to assist in developing the theory of the case and in preparing the testimony of expert witnesses from among our employees, our non-employee experts, and others in academia. In addition, our consultants provide general litigation support, including reviewing legal briefs and assisting in the appeals process.

Industry Expertise
We believe our ability to combine expertise in advanced economic and financial methods with in-depth knowledge of particular industries is one of our key competitive strengths. By maintaining expertise in certain industries, we provide clients practical advice tailored to their specific markets. This industry expertise, which we developed over decades of providing sophisticated consulting services to a diverse group of clients in many industries, differentiates us from many of our competitors. We believe that we have developed a strong reputation and substantial name recognition within specific industries, which has led to repeat business and new engagements from clients in those markets. While we provide services to clients in a wide variety of industries, we have particular expertise in the following industries:
•Communications & Media
•Consumer Products, Health, & Wellness
•Energy
•Entertainment & Leisure
•Financial Services
•Healthcare
•Life Sciences
•Manufacturing & Industrials
•Natural Resources
•Retail & Distribution
•Technology
•Transportation
Clients
We have completed thousands of engagements for clients around the world, including domestic and foreign corporations; federal, state, and local domestic government agencies; governments of foreign countries; public and private utilities; accounting firms; and national and international trade associations. Frequently, we work with major law firms who approach us on behalf of their clients. While we have particular expertise in a number of industries, we provide services to a diverse group of clients in a broad range of industries. Our policy is to keep the identities of our clients confidential unless our work for the client is already publicly disclosed. Our clients come from a broad range of industries, with no single client accounting for more than 5% of our revenues in any of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020.
We derived approximately 19% of consolidated revenues from fixed-price contracts in fiscal 2022, and approximately 24% of consolidated revenues from fixed-price contracts in each of fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. These contracts are more common in our management consulting practices, and would likely grow in number with expansion of those practices.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 939 consultants, consisting of 149 officers, 496 other senior staff and 294 junior staff. Approximately 77% of our senior staff have advanced degrees, with 43% of the advanced degrees being doctorate degrees, in addition to substantial management, technical, or industry expertise. We believe our financial results and reputation are directly related to the number and quality of our employee consultants.
We derive most of our revenues directly from the services provided by our employee consultants. Our employee consultants have backgrounds in many disciplines, including economics, business, corporate finance, accounting, materials sciences, life sciences, computer science, and engineering. We are highly selective in our hiring of consultants, recruiting primarily from a select group of leading universities and degree programs, industry, and government. We foster a culture where different ideas and perspectives are both welcomed and encouraged, and we strive to retain and promote diverse and dynamic talent. Our recruitment process evaluates an individual's experience, skills, and potential for growth, and is tailored to meet both the needs of the role and the interests of the candidate. We have trained our interviewing professionals on practices associated with inclusive interviewing, including how to minimize unconscious bias. We believe consultants choose to work for us because of our emphasis on accurate, rigorous analytics and high quality work; our culture that values intellectual curiosity, initiative, and resourcefulness; and our collegial, inclusive, and multi-disciplinary approach to complex client needs. Our training and career development programs for our employee consultants focus on providing multi-dimensional technical, foundational, and consulting skills. This framework is designed to complement on-the-job experience and an employee's pursuit of his or her own career development. Employee consultants participate in structured programs focused on managing teams, technical and empirical knowledge, and building client relationships. Through our ongoing internally-led workshops, speakers deliver presentations and conduct discussions with our employee consultants on various topics ranging from analytical tools to thought leadership material and service capabilities. We also provide scheduled courses designed to improve an employee's professional skills, such as written and oral presentation, marketing techniques, feedback discussions, and business development. Additionally, we encourage our employee consultants to pursue their academic interests through self-directed training modules, our on-demand library of software webinars, and external professional development and continuing education opportunities. 
Many of our employee consultants have signed non-solicitation agreements, which generally prohibit the employee from soliciting our clients or soliciting or hiring our employees for one year or longer following termination of the person's employment with us. We seek to align each employee's interest with our overall interests, and many of our strongest contributors have an equity interest in us.
We compensate our senior corporate leaders, practice leaders, key revenue generators, and other employees with salary and a mixture of incentive-based programs that provide for cash and equity compensation. We maintain a bonus program through which we pay annual, performance-based cash bonuses to our employee consultants and certain other employees. In 2009, the compensation committee of our Board of Directors adopted our long-term incentive program, or "LTIP," as a framework for equity grants made under our 2006 equity incentive plan to our senior corporate leaders, practice leaders, and key revenue generators. The equity awards granted under the LTIP include stock options, time-vesting restricted stock units, and performance-vesting restricted stock units. In December 2016, our compensation committee modified the LTIP to allow grants of service- and performance-based cash awards in lieu of, or in addition to, equity awards to our senior corporate leaders, practice leaders, and key revenue generators. These LTIP cash awards are currently granted under our cash incentive plan. The LTIP is designed to reward our senior corporate leaders, practice leaders and key revenue generators and to provide them with the opportunity to share in the long-term growth of our business. The compensation committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for approving all cash and equity awards under the LTIP, all other equity compensation awards, and the total bonuses to be distributed under our bonus program, and for establishing performance goals under compensation awards and determining the extent to which these goals are achieved. Our chief executive officer, in his discretion and in consultation with the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, approves the bonuses to be granted to our employees.
In addition, we work closely with a select group of non-employee experts from leading universities and industry. These experts supplement the work of our employee consultants and generate business for us. We believe these experts choose to work with us because of the interesting and challenging nature of our work, the opportunity to work with our quality-oriented consultants, and the financially rewarding nature of the work. Several non-employee experts, generally comprising the more active of those with whom we work, have entered into restrictive covenants with us of varying lengths, which, in some cases, include non-competition agreements.
Our revenues largely depend on the number of hours worked by our employee consultants. As a result, we experience certain seasonal effects that impact our revenue, such as holiday seasons and the summer vacation season.
Marketing and Business Development
Our business development and marketing activities, led by our employee consultants and our Marketing, Business Development and Coaching group, emphasize building and maintaining relationships, cultivating brand awareness, and generating leads for new work. We encourage our employee consultants to generate new business from both existing and new clients, and we reward our employee consultants with increased compensation and promotions for obtaining new business. Many of our consultants have published articles in industry, business, economic, legal, or scientific journals, and have made speeches and presentations at industry conferences and seminars, which serve as a means of attracting new business and enhancing their reputations. On occasion, employee consultants work with one or more non-employee experts to market our services.
We supplement the personal marketing efforts of our employee consultants with diverse business development and marketing activities, including virtual and in-person seminars and presentations, speaking at and attending relevant conferences, social networking events, podcasts, videos, social media, and extensive thought leadership that we publish in industry, business, economic, legal, or scientific journals. We regularly organize seminars for existing and potential clients featuring panel members that include our employee consultants, non-employee experts, and leading government officials. We have an extensive set of brochures and infographics organized around our service areas, which describe our experience and capabilities. Our corporate website is another means of marketing our consultants and capabilities as it houses information about our business development activities, engagements, and biographies of our employee consultants and academic affiliates. We distribute publications to existing and potential clients highlighting emerging trends and noteworthy hires, awards, and engagements. Because existing clients are an important source of repeat business and referrals, we communicate regularly with our existing clients to keep them informed of developments that affect their markets and industries.
We derive the majority of our revenues from new engagements with existing clients. We have worked with leading law firms across the globe and believe we have developed a reputation among law firms as a preferred source of sophisticated economic advice for litigation and regulatory work. For our management consulting services, we also rely on referrals from existing clients, and supplement referrals with a significant amount of direct marketing to new clients through conferences, seminars, publications, presentations, and direct solicitations.
It is important to us that we conduct business ethically and in accordance with industry standards and our own rigorous professional standards. We carefully consider the pursuit of each specific market, client, and engagement in light of these standards.
Competition
The market for economic and management consulting services is intensely competitive, highly fragmented, and subject to rapid change. In general, there are few barriers to entry into our markets, and we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the economic and management consulting industries. In the litigation, regulatory, and financial consulting markets, we compete primarily with other economic consulting firms and individual academics. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are reputation, analytical ability, industry expertise, size, and service. In the management consulting market, we compete primarily with other business and management consulting firms, specialized or industry-specific consulting firms, the consulting practices of large accounting firms, and the internal professional resources of existing and potential clients. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are reputation, industry expertise, analytical ability, service, and price.
