ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
DLH Holdings Corp. is a provider of technology-enabled business process outsourcing and program management solutions, primarily to improve and better deploy large-scale federal health and human service initiatives. The Company derives 99% of its revenue from agencies of the Federal government, providing services to several agencies including the Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA"), Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), and the Department of Defense ("DoD"). Incorporated in New Jersey in 1969, the Company primarily contracts with its government customers through its subsidiaries DLH Solutions, Inc. (“DLH Solutions”), Danya International, LLC (“Danya”), and Social & Scientific Systems, Inc. (“S3”).
On June 7, 2019, the Company acquired S3, which provides clinical and biomedical research, epidemiology, health policy, and program evaluation services in the public health space. S3 utilizes advanced research (including longitudinal studies), data analytics, and secure IT platform services to support public health agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services including National Institutes of Health ("NIH") and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). The acquisition expands our ability to provide complementary services across multiple government markets.
Our business offerings are aligned to three market focus areas within the federal health services market space.

• | Defense and Veteran Health Solutions;


• | Human Services and Solutions;


• | Public Health and Life Sciences;

Prospectively, we expect they will represent approximately 45%, 20%, and 35% of our revenue stream, respectively, for our 2020 fiscal year.
Defense and Veterans’ Health Solutions: DLH provides critical healthcare services and delivery solutions to the VA, Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, the Defense Health Agency and the Army Medical Command. The VA is responsible for delivering medical, educational, financing and other life event services to an estimated 19.3 million veterans. There are over 9 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care program which provides services that include the distribution of prescription drugs from the network of regional processing centers. The Company is at the forefront of ensuring that veterans receive their out-patient prescriptions on time, each day, through the VA CMOP pharmacy program which has been recognized for service excellence, earning the JD Powers evaluation of mail order pharmacies for each of the past nine years. The Company is also engaged in efforts to alleviate homelessness among veterans by supporting veterans' transition back into the community through mental health evaluations, behavioral readiness, skills assessment, career counseling, and job preparation services.

Further, the Company provides a range of case management, physical and behavioral health examinations, and associated medical administration services to enhance the assessment and transition process for military personnel readiness commands and individual service members. We deliver clinical drug and alcohol counseling services to Navy installations worldwide as part of the clinical preceptorship program, thereby improving sailor health and readiness. 
Human Services and Solutions: Our customers support local communities by promoting economic, educational, and social well-being of children. The mission extends to international communities through the prevention of epidemic diseases, response to natural disasters, and development of local economies. We support our customers by providing a wide range of human services and solutions to HHS, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") and the Department of State. Our range of services support the critical missions of these agencies and their respective operating divisions, to include the Office of Head Start ("OHS"), Administration for Children and Families ("ACF") and the United States Agency of International Development ("USAID"). In this market, the Company provides large-scale program monitoring and evaluation; electronic medical records migration; data collection and management; and nutritional and social health assessments. Additionally, the Company also provides large-scale data analytics as well as enterprise-level IT system architecture design, migration planning, and ongoing management of system implementation and capacity building using experienced subject matter experts and project management resources. 
Public Health and Life Sciences: In this market, our customers support national interests by ensuring our capability to fight diseases, respond to national and regional medical crises, and support the administration of providing health care benefits to senior and at-risk members of our communities. In support of this mission, we provide services to multiple operating divisions within HHS, including NIH, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC"), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). The Company's services include clinical trials, epidemiology studies, advancing disease prevention methods and health promotion to underserved and at-risk communities. We deliver our services through development of strategic communication campaigns, research on emerging trends, health informatics analyses, and application of best practices including mobile, social, and interactive media. The Company leverages evidence-based methods and web technology to drive health equity to our most vulnerable populations through public engagement. Projects often involve highly specialized expertise and research methodologies.
Capabilities and certifications
We continue to invest in credentials that drive excellence in our support to current clients and create differentiation as we compete in this space. These investments include development of secure IT platforms, sophisticated data analytic tools and techniques, and implementation of a lean six sigma environment. We are actively pursuing additional credentials that will support our customer's needs in providing a secure cloud computing environment.
Building upon our lean six sigma and ISO 9001 credentials, we have invested further in agile software development credentials for our technical staff, have achieved Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level 3, and are pursuing industry-leading cyber security certifications. We believe that these qualifications will further enhance our value propositions for current programs, as well as future business we pursue. In addition, we continue to build upon our heritage of excellent customer satisfaction in support of key federal programs. We have achieved Joint Commission certification for the safety and quality of our healthcare services delivery against national standards. These nationally recognized best practices certifications demonstrate our commitment to continuous improvement and performance excellence that is critical to our organic growth objectives.
We also invest in talent development initiatives, to include industry-leading learning management, professional credentialing, and applicant tracking systems. These will further enhance our highly qualified employee base and augment our efforts to infuse top talent into our operations through world-class recruiting and talent management tools.
Position and Distribution of Services and Solutions in Our Markets
The markets in which we compete and the manner in which we are positioned within them, are characterized by a number of features including, but not limited to: 

• | specialized credentials and licenses held by a substantial component of our employee base;


• | prime contractor position in contracts representing 96% of our revenue;


• | strong past performance record, as evidenced by our VA customer scoring the highest in overall satisfaction in the J.D. Power National Pharmacy Study over the past nine years; and

4


• | targeted expansion in critical national priority markets with Federal budget stability.

The Company operates primarily through prime contracts awarded by the government through competitive bidding processes. The Company has a diverse mix of contract vehicles with various agencies of the United States Government, which supports our overall corporate growth strategy. Our revenue is distributed to time and materials contracts (84%), cost reimbursable contracts (14%) and the remaining are firm fixed price contracts (2%). We also provide services under IDIQ and government wide acquisition contracts, such as General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts. The Company currently holds multiple GSA schedule contracts, under which we provide services that constitute a significant percentage of our total revenue. These Federal contract schedules are renewed on a recurring basis for a multi-year period.
Major Customers
A major customer is defined as a customer from whom the Company derives at least 10% of our revenues. Our largest customer is the VA, which comprised approximately 57% and 63% of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our second largest customer, HHS, comprised approximately 39% and 34% of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The recent acquisition of S3 furthers the Company's reach into HHS, and we expect HHS to surpass the VA as our largest customer in fiscal 2020 as measured in revenue volume. 
Major Contracts
The revenue attributable to the VA customers was derived from 16 separate contracts related to its performance of pharmacy and logistics services in support of the VA’s consolidated mail outpatient pharmacy program. Nine contracts for pharmacy services, which represent approximately $52.5 million and $48.7 million for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, are currently operating under extensions through October 2020 pending completion of the procurement process for a new contract. A single renewal request for proposal (“RFP”) has been issued for these contracts that requires the prime contractor be a service-disabled veteran owned small business ("SDVOSB"), which precludes the Company from bidding on the RFP as a prime contractor. The Company has joined an SDVOSB team as a subcontractor to respond to this RFP. Should the contract be awarded to an SDVOSB partner of DLH, the Company expects to continue to perform a significant amount of the contract’s volume of business.
The remaining seven contracts for logistics services, which represent approximately $39.4 million and $35.7 million for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, have been extended through June 2020. An RFP for the seven logistics contracts has been issued and provides for evaluation and award of the contract based on the classification of the bidder, with preference given to an SDVOSB prime contractor. The Company has joined an SDVOSB team to respond to this RFP. We believe that these contracts will similarly be extended during the procurement process.
The Company's contract with HHS in support of the Head Start program generated $37.6 million and $41.0 million revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This contract is on a time and materials basis and consists of a base period of four option periods for a total term of five years through April 2020 and the customer is expected to issue a RFP in fiscal 2020.
Backlog
Backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly multi-year government contracts and will vary depending upon the timing of new/renewal contract awards. Backlog is based upon customer commitments that the Company believes to be firm over the remaining performance period of our contracts. The value of multi-client, competitive Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") contract awards is included in backlog computation only when a task order is awarded or if the contract is a single award IDIQ contract. While no assurances can be given that existing contracts will result in earned revenue in any future period, or at all, the Company’s major customers have historically exercised their contractual renewal options. At September 30, 2019, our total backlog was approximately $414.1 million compared to $172.2 million as of September 30, 2018, reflecting the impact of the S3 acquisition.
Backlog value is quantified from management's judgment and assumptions about the volume of services based on past volume trends and current planning developed with customers. Our backlog may consist of both funded and unfunded amounts under existing contracts including option periods. At September 30, 2019, our funded backlog was approximately $114.8 million and our unfunded backlog was $299.3 million.

Competitive Landscape
Competitive solicitations and long business development cycles are characteristics of the government and defense industry in which we operate. For major program competition, the business acquisition cycle typically ranges from 18 to 36 months. Companies may pursue work either as prime contractor or partner with other companies in a subcontractor role. Those competing as prime contractors normally expend substantially more resources than those in subcontractor roles. We partner and compete with several large and small-business companies in pursuit of acquiring new business.
Our competitors include operating units within, among others: Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., CACI International, Inc., ICF International, Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., Mantech International Corp., MAXIMUS, Inc., UnitedHealth Group, Inc. operating under Optum, VSE Corporation, and Westat, Inc.
The Company competes with these companies by leveraging our differentiating suite of tools and uniquely integrating people and processes resulting in highly competitive proposals and a solid track record of past performance. The Company believes that its proprietary tools and process, including e-PRAT® and SPOT-m®, along with its cloud-based management system differentiate the Company from its competitors. We compete for awards through a full and open competition on a best-value basis. The Company draws heavily from its consistently high-quality past performance ratings, proven and evolving technical differentiators, key personnel credentials and growing market recognition to compete. The Company believes that its track record, knowledge and processes with respect to government contract bidding represent significant competitive advantages. Our recent and future success in this competitive landscape hinges on our ability to continue to uniquely integrate people, processes and technology tools to deliver best value solutions for our targeted clients (both government and industry partners).
Additionally, the Federal government may elect to restrict certain procurements, including for renewals of our current contracts, to bidders that qualify for certain special statuses such as veteran owned, small, or small disadvantaged businesses. For those procurements, we would be limited to a subcontractor role.
Intellectual Property
Because our business involves providing services to government entities, our operations generally are not substantially dependent upon obtaining and/or maintaining copyright or trademark protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. We claim copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. The Company holds two registered trademarks, e-PRAT® and SPOT-m®, that optimize resource allocation and supply chain management processes in connection with our business process management services. We maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets adequate protection to ensure their continuing availability.
Government Regulation
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. In addition, many federal and state laws materially affect the Company's operations. These laws relate to ethics, labor, tax, and employment matters. As any employer is, the Company is subject to federal and state statutes and regulations governing their standards of business conduct with the government. The development of additional statutes and regulations and interpretation of existing statutes and regulations with respect to our industry can be expected to evolve over time. Through its corporate membership with the Professional Services Council and other affiliations, the Company monitors proposed and pending regulations from relevant congressional committees and government agency policies that have potential impact upon our industry and our specific strategically targeted markets. As with any commercial enterprise, the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or direction of the development of Federal statutes and regulations that will affect its business operations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.
Employee Relations
As of September 30, 2019, the Company employed over 1,900 employees performing in over 30 locations throughout the U.S. and one location overseas. Management believes that it has good relations with its employees. In October 2014, employees at our Chicago location approved the adoption of union representation for non-management employees. Union representation has been certified for these employees and collective bargaining discussions are ongoing. Management does not expect this agreement to materially impact results of operations.
