ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

General 
 
Our business focuses on development and operation of online dating and mobile gaming products either developed and operated by us, or developed by us but co-operated by third parties; or developed by third parties but co-operated by us.
 
Our self-developed and self-operated online dating products Little Love (“小恋爱”) and Hotchat (“热聊”) are mobile applications geared towards Chinese singles designed to increase a user’s likelihood of finding a romantic connection. Our mission is to help individuals forge life-long relationships with others that share their interests and values. Through these mobile applications, our users can search for and communicate with other like-minded individuals. Our product creates a virtual community where users can meet, chat and message. We operate location-based social networks for meeting new people on mobile platforms, including on iPhone, Android, iPad and other tablets that facilitate interactions among users and encourage users to connect and chat with each other.
 
Our online dating mobile platforms monetize through advertising, in-app purchases, and paid subscriptions. The Company offers online marketing capabilities, which enable marketers to display their advertisements in different formats and in different locations. In the near future, we plan to offer sophisticated data science for highly effective hyper-targeting. The Company is actively seeking the opportunities to works with its advertisers to maximize the effectiveness of their campaigns by optimizing advertisement formats and placements. We temporarily suspended our paid advertisements for Little Love to adjust our marketing strategy of Little Love from April 2018. Little Love is currently under development and upgrade. The Company believes it will relaunch its advertisement for the Little love in the second quarter of 2020.
 
Our self-developed mobile gaming application is Eternal Tribe (“永恒部落”) which was launched by us in January 2018. For Eternal Tribe, our users can deposit fund on as needed basis for the in-app purchases. Eternal Tribe is Android-based mobile games developed solely by us to diversify our product portfolio. We updated Eternal Tribe based on the collected user experiences and market feedbacks and launched an upgraded version of Eternal Tribe in July 2018 and engaged third party to co-market and co-operate Eternal Tribe on different platforms and channels. However, based on the market responses, we suspended Eternal Tribe in November 2018 and dismissed the development team for Eternal Tribe. The revenue from Eternal Tribe was immaterial for the year ended September 30, 2019. We plan to focus our limited resources on other games that we are co-developing or co-operating; or about to develop or operate with other parties.
 
As China mobile game market continues to grow at rapid pace, our management team believe it is the right time to leverage our expertise in gaming app development to tap into this hot market. We have been actively developing co-operation relationship with other developers and operators since March 2018. There are two games that we co-operated with their developers: Magician Hero (“魔纹游戏”) and Shu Mountain Fantasy (“蜀山奇缘”) of which we were responsible for marketing, co-operating and maintenance on the platforms and channels introduced by us. Magician Hero features non-stop-3D real action and battles based on Greek mythology. Shu Mountain Fantasy is a role-playing game of Xian Xia theme based on the period of the fairy magic war, so that users can witness the fall of the fairy tales. There was no revenue of the co-operations with other developers or operators for the year ended September 30, 2019. The co-operation agreements with other developers have expired by May 2019.
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately 3,475,423 registered members for Little Love, 143,453 registered members for Hotchat.
 
The Share Exchange
 
On March 16, 2018, CX Network Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (previously known as “mLight Tech Inc.” or “MLGT”, a Florida corporation) (“CXKJ” or the “Company”), Chuangxiang Holdings Inc., a company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“CX Cayman”), and Continent Investment Management Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Continent”), and Golden Fish Capital Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Golden Fish”, together with “Continent”, the “CX Cayman Stockholders”) entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which CXKJ acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of CX Cayman in exchange for 5,350,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of CXKJ (the “Share Exchange”). The Share Exchange was closed on March 20, 2018. As a result of the Share Exchange, CX Cayman became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Immediately prior to entering into the Share Exchange Agreement with CX Cayman and stockholders of CX Cayman, we were a shell company with no significant asset or operation. As a result of the Share Exchange, we operate through our PRC affiliated entity, namely Shenzhen CX, located in Shenzhen, China. CX Cayman does not have any substantive operations other than holding CX HK, which in return holding CX Network, who controls Shenzhen CX through certain contractual arrangements.
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement signed on March 20, 2018, CXKJ acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of CX Cayman in exchange for 5,350,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share of CXKJ. As a result of the Share Exchange, the business of CX Cayman becomes our business. As such, the following results of operations are focused on the operations of CX Cayman and exclude the operations of the Company prior to the Share Exchange.
 
Upon the consummation of the Share Exchange, we engage in the business of developing and operating membership-based social network, dating and mobile gaming, and interactive live broadcast platforms. We are currently devoting our efforts to develop mobile applications and online platforms servicing the Asia market.

Going Concern 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company’s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.
 
In assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of September 30, 2019, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded the current assets, its accumulated deficit was approximately $2,301,435 and the Company has incurred losses since inception. None of the Company’s stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties, are under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
 
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Our Business
 
General
 
Our current primary business is in the online dating industry, which we believe fulfills significant needs for single adults looking to meet a companion. Traditional methods such as printed personals advertisements, offline dating services and public gathering places often do not meet the needs of single people. Printed personals advertisements offer individuals limited personal information and interaction before meeting. Offline dating services are time-consuming, expensive and offer a smaller number of potential partners. Public gathering places such as restaurants, bars and other social venues provide a limited opportunity to learn about others prior to an in-person meeting. In contrast, online personals services facilitate interaction between singles by allowing them to screen and communicate with a large number of potential companions before they meet in-person. With features such as detailed personal profiles, email, mobile chat and instant messaging, this medium allows users to communicate with other singles at their convenience and affords them the ability to meet multiple people in an anonymous, convenient and secure setting.
 
The online personals industry in China has experienced significant growth in recent years. According to 2018 China’s Online Dating & Matchmaking Report, the revenue of China’s online dating & matchmaking sector reached approximately 712 million USD in 2016, accounting for 49.1% of the total revenue of dating & matchmaking market. It is expected that the proportion will expand to 63.1% by 2021. Members of the millennial generation (individuals under 35 years old) tend to have the highest usage of online or mobile personals sites because of the large gender imbalance caused by one-child policy launched by Chinese government back in 1980.

Another focus of our business is mobile gaming. According to the 2018 China Mobile Game Industry Research Report, in March 2018, the Chinese government suspended the approval of game numbers, which is a part of the approval document of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television agreeing to the relevant game publishing and online operation. Such approval of game numbers reopened in December 2018, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of new games in the Chinese game market. The proportion of the Chinses game market in the global market has fallen for the first time in the following six years, from 33% in 2017 to 27% in 2018. However, the Chinese mobile game market still maintains an upward trend in 2018, with market size of RMB 164.6 billion, an increase of 10.5% over 2017. In 2018, the number of Chinses mobile gamers was 626 million, an increase of 2.7% as compared to that in 2017. The Chinese mobile game market officially entered the era of inventory from the incremental era. In the future, the Chinese mobile game market will continue to strengthen the game operations to enhance users’ gaming experience.

Eternal Tribe (“永恒部落”)

The Eternal Tribe is a battle role-playing mobile game (“RPG”). This game, built with unity 3D engine, is designed to bring gamers intense and character-driven narratives, transport them into the most authentic World of Warcraft (“WOW”) environment and allow gamers to live out fantasy epics. Players take command of heroes from various races and have the options to customize their characters in a way similar to WOW. There is also the deluxe edition that offers additional features to help gamers in turn-based battles and give gamers options to waltz their ways through the story campaign and adjust their strategies in extra game modes. The combat system in this game is well-crafted to capture the intense sensation of fantasy warfare, and the unique weapon selection system further enhances the game experience. The abundance of strategic combat options offered by this game makes it well worth a go for fans of tactical RPGs.
Other Products
 
There are two games that we co-operated with their developers: Magician Hero (魔纹游戏) and Shu Mountain Fantasy (蜀山奇缘). Magician Hero features non-stop-3D real action and battles based on Greek mythology. Shu Mountain Fantasy is a role-playing game of Xian Xia theme based on the period of the fairy magic war, so that users can witness the fall of the fairy tales. We were responsible for introducing the games to third parties’ platform or channels, marketing and promotions, operation and maintenance on those platforms or channels introduced by us.
Sales and Marketing
 
We engage in a variety of marketing activities intended to drive user traffic to our mobile applications and give us the opportunity to introduce our products and services to prospective users. For our online dating apps, we (i) pay various mobile app channels to broadcast our apps to raise awareness of our products and increase their ranking to attract new users, (ii) engage in self-promoting on social media, (iii) advertise our products via our cooperative public platforms, (iv) organize off-line experience events and activities; and (v) we work with Hong Kong Xinglong Entertainment to engage its celebrity Girls Group 1n1 sisters as our product representative and singing the song “Little Love” for our application. With respect to our mobile gaming application which we launched in January 2018, our marketing strategy focus on seeking well known network and platform providers to broadcast the games, improving the products to raise its ranking in appstores, and display advertising to increase the exposure to attract new users.
 
Commencing in March 2018, we have been actively engaging co-developers or co-operators either to publish, market, or operate Eternal Tribe and other games that we are developing; or to allow other developers to use our Little Love platform to market and operate their games, or to introduce and operate their games on third parties’ platforms.
 
Since April 2018, we temporarily suspended our paid advertisements for Little Love to adjust our marketing strategy of Little Love. Little Love is currently under development and upgrade. The Company believes it will relaunch its advertisement for the Little love in the second quarter of 2020. In November 2018, based on the market responses, we suspended Eternal Tribe and dismissed the development team for Eternal Tribe. We plan to focus our limited resources on other games that we are co-developing or co-operating; or about to develop or operate with other parties.


Research and Development
 
We have an in-house R&D team consisting of skilled engineers to develop our apps. For the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, research and development expenses amounted to $16,604 and $359,775, respectively. The decrease of research and development expenses in the amount of $343,171 or 95% for the year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to the decreased activities in developing new games and applications.
Customer Service
 
Our call center and email support teams monitor our mobile applications as well as mobile application developed by other companies for fraudulent activity, assist members with billing questions, help members complete personal profiles and answer technical questions. Customer service representatives receive ongoing training in an effort to better personalize the experience for members and paying subscribers who call or email us and to capitalize on upselling opportunities.
Technology
 
Our internal product teams are focused on the development and maintenance of products in addition to building and managing our software and hardware infrastructure. We intend to continue investing in the development of new products, such as mobile applications, and enhancing the efficiency and functionality of our existing products and infrastructure.

Our network infrastructure and operations are designed to deliver high levels of availability, performance, security and scalability in a cost-effective manner. We operate web and database servers co-located at a third party data center facility in Irvine, California.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment with minimal barriers to entry. We believe the primary competitive factors in creating a community on the Internet are functionality, brand recognition, reputation, critical mass of members, member affinity and loyalty, ease-of-use, quality of service and reliability. We compete with a number of large and small companies, including vertically integrated Internet portals and specialty-focused media companies that provide online and offline products and services to the online dating market we serve. Our principal online dating services competitors include other mobile applications such as Momo, Tantan, Baobao and others. Our principal mobile gaming competitors include other online gaming applications such as Happy Doudizhu, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, JJ Doudizhu and others. In addition, we face competition from new entrants that have recently offered free and freemium mobile applications such as Feeling. 
 
We believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following:
 

● | the size and diversity of our member and paying subscriber bases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the timing and market acceptance of our apps, including the developments and enhancements to those apps and features relative to those offered by our competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer service and support efforts;
--+--------------------------------------


● | selling and marketing efforts; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | our brand strength in the marketplace relative to our competitors.

Conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, however, is still subject to the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. Foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, the SAFE and the State Reform and Development Commission.
Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, enterprises in China is required to set aside at least 10.0% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year as its statutory general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50.0% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
Government Regulation
 
Our business is regulated by diverse and evolving laws and governmental authorities in China. We are subject to laws and regulations related to Internet communications, privacy, consumer protection, security and data protection, intellectual property rights, commerce, taxation, entertainment, recruiting and advertising. These laws and regulations are becoming more prevalent, and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the Chinese governments. Any failure by us to comply with existing laws and regulations may subject us to liabilities. New laws and regulations governing such matters could be enacted or amendments may be made to existing regulations at any time that could adversely impact our services. Plus, legal uncertainties surrounding Chinese government regulations could increase our costs of doing business, require us to revise our services, prevent us from delivering our services over the Internet or slow the growth of the Internet, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulations Regarding Foreign Investment
 
Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission. Industries listed in the Catalogue are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. The restricted and prohibited categories combined are also called the negative list for foreign investment entry and will be subject to special administrative measures. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as constituting a fourth “permitted” category. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.

Taxation
 
PRC Enterprise Income Tax
 
The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules provide that from January 1, 2008, a uniform income tax rate of 25% is applied equally to domestic enterprises as well as foreign investment enterprises.
 
The EIT Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends and other distributions payable by a PRC resident enterprise to investors who are “non-resident enterprises” (that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant dividend or other distribution is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business). However, pursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income effective on December 8, 2006, the withholding tax rate for dividends paid by a PRC resident enterprise is 5% if the Hong Kong enterprise owns at least 25% of the capital of the PRC enterprise; otherwise, the dividend withholding tax rate is 10%. According to the Notice of the PRC State Administration of Taxation on Issues relating to the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009 and effective on the same day, the corporate recipient of dividends distributed by PRC enterprises must satisfy the direct ownership thresholds at all times during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. However, if a company is deemed to be a pass-through entity rather than a qualified owner of benefits, it cannot enjoy the favorable tax treatments provided in the tax arrangement. In addition, if transactions or arrangements are deemed by the relevant tax authorities to be entered into mainly for the purpose of enjoying favorable tax treatments under the tax arrangement, such favorable tax treatments may be subject to adjustment by the relevant tax authorities in the future.
 
Business Tax and Value-added Tax
 
Pursuant to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and effective on January 1, 1994, as amended on November 10, 2008 and effective January 1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services.
 
In March 2016, the Ministry of Finance and SAT jointly issued the Pilot Program of Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax (“VAT”) in an All-round Manner, or Circular 36, effective from May 2016, according to which PRC tax authorities have started imposing VAT on revenues from various service sectors, including real estate, construction, financial services and insurance, as well as other lifestyle service sectors, replacing the business tax replacing the business tax that co-existed with VAT for over 20 years. The VAT rates applicable to us may be generally higher than the business tax rate we were subject to prior to the implementation of Circular 36. For example, the VAT rate for sale and leasing of self-developed real estate will be increased from 5% (business rate) to 11%. However, VAT rate for leasing of real estate which was owned by general taxpayer before April 30, 2016, will be reduced to 5%. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules provide that from January 1, 2008, a uniform income tax rate of 25% is applied equally to domestic enterprises as well as foreign investment enterprises.
 
Regulations Regarding Foreign Exchange
 
Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, as amended, and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is freely convertible to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, unless expressly exempted by laws and regulations, still require prior approval from SAFE or its provincial branch for conversion of RMB into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside of the PRC. Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in RMB. Foreign currency revenues received by PRC companies may be repatriated into China or retained outside of China in accordance with requirements and terms specified by SAFE.
Regulation Regarding Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC
 
Residents
 
Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, issued by SAFE and effective in July 4, 2014, regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing and conduct round trip investment in China.
 
10

 

Circular 37 and other SAFE rules require PRC residents, including both legal and natural persons, to register with the local banks before making capital contribution to any company outside of China (an “offshore SPV”) with onshore or offshore assets and equity interests legally owned by PRC residents. In addition, any PRC individual resident who is the stockholder of an offshore SPV is required to update its registration with the local banks with respect to that offshore SPV in connection with change of basic information of the offshore SPV such as its company name, business term, the shareholding by individual PRC resident, merger, division and with respect to the individual PRC resident in case of any increase or decrease of capital in the offshore SPV, transfer of shares or swap of shares by the individual PRC resident. Failure to comply with the required SAFE registration and updating requirements described above may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV, including increasing the registered capital of, payment of dividends and other distributions to, and receiving capital injections from the offshore SPV. Failure to comply with Circular 37 may also subject the relevant PRC residents or the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.
 
Regulation Regarding Labor and Social Insurance
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
 
In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law and Administration Measures on Housing Fund, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, we have 3 full time employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We actively seek acquisition targets to complement our existing business and the Company plans to hire additional employees as required once we identify and merge with a target company.
