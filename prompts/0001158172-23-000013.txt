Overview
We are a global information and analytics company that measures advertising, content, and the consumer audiences of each, across media platforms. We create our products using a global data platform that combines information on digital platforms (connected (Smart) televisions, mobile devices, tablets and computers), television ("TV"), direct to consumer applications, and movie screens with demographics and other descriptive information. We have developed proprietary data science that enables measurement of person-level and household-level audiences, removing duplicated viewing across devices and over time. This combination of data and methods enables a common standard for buyers and sellers to transact on advertising. This helps companies across the media ecosystem better understand and monetize their audiences and develop marketing plans, content and products to more efficiently and effectively reach those audiences. Our ability to unify behavioral and other descriptive data enables us to provide audience ratings, advertising verification, and granular consumer segments that describe hundreds of millions of consumers. Our customers include digital publishers, television networks, movie studios, content owners, brand advertisers, agencies and technology providers.
The information we analyze crosses geographies, types of content and activities, including websites, mobile and over the top ("OTT") applications ("apps"), video games, television and movie programming, electronic commerce ("e-commerce") and advertising.
We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Reston, Virginia with principal offices located at 11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600, Reston, VA 20190. Our telephone number is 703-438-2000.

Organizational Restructuring
On September 29, 2022, we communicated a workforce reduction as part of our broader efforts to improve cost efficiency and better align our operating structure and resources with strategic priorities (collectively, the "Restructuring Plan"). In addition to employee terminations, the Restructuring Plan is expected to include the reallocation of commercial and product development resources; reinvestment in and modernization of key technology platforms; consolidation of data storage and processing activities to reduce our data center footprint; and reduction of other operating expenses, including software and facility costs. We may also determine to exit certain activities in certain geographic regions in order to more effectively align resources with business priorities.
Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement
On February 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") to expand our aggregate borrowing capacity from $25.0 million to $40.0 million. The 2022 amendment also replaced the Eurodollar Rate with a SOFR-based interest rate and modified the Applicable Rate definition in the Revolving Credit Agreement to increase the Applicable Rate payable on SOFR-based loans to 2.50%. Finally, the amendment modified certain financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
On February 24, 2023, we entered into an additional amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement that further modified our financial covenants, introduced a minimum liquidity covenant, and increased the Applicable Rate payable on SOFR-based loans to 3.50%.

Macroeconomic Factors
During 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and related government mandates and restrictions had a significant impact on the media, advertising and entertainment industries in which we operate. The pandemic also had an impact on our business, including with respect to the execution of new and renewal contracts, the impact of closed movie theaters on our customers, customer payment delays and requests to modify contractual payment terms. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took actions in 2020 and 2021 to mitigate the liquidity impact, including freezing hiring, exiting non-critical consultants and contractors, terminating or negotiating reductions in vendor agreements and leases, and reducing certain travel, marketing, recruiting and other corporate activities. Although we cannot quantify the impact that the pandemic may have on our business in the future, we saw positive recovery in 2022, including the reopening of theaters in most markets worldwide. At the same time, however, macroeconomic factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions caused some advertisers to reduce or delay advertising expenditures in the second half of 2022. These declines had a direct impact on demand for our products, particularly those for which we recognize revenue based on impressions used. We expect that softness in the advertising market will continue to affect our business in 2023.
Background and Market
We were founded in 1999 on the belief that digital technology would transform the interactions between people, media and brands in ways that would generate substantial demand for data and analytics about that interaction. The growing adoption of digital technologies also allowed measurement of the behavior of consumers' online activities. Based on this vision, we built a global opt-in panel that provided insight into online activities. Over the years we have enhanced our product offerings by uniting panel data with census-level data from website tags and other sources, and we expanded our presence in various markets. We also have access to millions of television and video on demand ("VOD") screens and the ability to measure box office results from movie screens across the world. 
In December 2021, we acquired Shareablee, Inc. ("Shareablee"), allowing us to expand our Media Metrix® and Video Metrix® currencies to include Shareablee's social media engagement and video insights, in order to bridge the industry gap of traditional digital and social measurement services. 
Our Approach to Media Measurement
Our approach to measuring media consumption addresses the ubiquitous nature of media content and the fragmentation caused by the variety of platforms and technologies used to access such content. Advertising exposure and effectiveness is another rapidly changing and fragmented area where we apply scale for validation and campaign measurement across devices, platforms and ecosystem technology providers. We believe this fragmentation presents major challenges to using legacy measurement systems that are comprised of relatively small panels of cooperating consumers or limited to specific media platforms. Our products and services are built on measurement and analytic capabilities comprised of broad-based data collection, proprietary databases, internally developed software and a computational infrastructure to measure, analyze and report on digital, television and movie activity at the level of granularity that we believe the media and advertising industries need.
Data Collection 
The following collection methods illustrate our extensive data sourcing:
•We collect data from proprietary consumer panels that measure the use of computers, tablets and smartphones that access the internet. These panelists have agreed to install our passive metering software on their devices, home network or both.
•Comscore's Digital Census Data is our census digital network whereby content publishers share information with us. That sharing includes direct integrations with the publishers, as well as publishers' implementation of our software code (referred to as "tagging") on their websites, in mobile applications and video players to provide us usage information.
•We license certain demographic and behavioral mobile and panel data from third-party data providers.
•We obtain television viewership information from satellite, telecommunications, connected (Smart) TV and cable operators covering millions of television and VOD screens.
•We measure gross receipts and attendance information from movie screens across the world.
•We integrate our digital and television viewership information with other third-party datasets that include consumer demographic characteristics, attitudes, lifestyles and purchase behavior.
•We integrate many of our services with ad serving platforms.
•We utilize knowledgeable in-house industry analysts that span verticals such as pharmaceuticals, media, finance, consumer packaged goods and political information to add value to our data.
•We have created an opt-in Total Home Panel, which can capture data that runs through a home's internet connection. This expands our intelligence to include such activity as game console and Internet of Things ("IOT") device usage.
•We collect content and advertising data from major social platforms for measurement, audience, and lift analysis.

Data Science and Management
The ability to integrate, manage and transform massive amounts of data is core to our company. We continue to invest in technologies to enable large-scale measurement with protection of consumer privacy and attractive economics. Our systems contain multiple redundancies and advanced distributed processing technologies. We have created innovations such as:
•Our United Digital Measurement® ("UDM") methodology, which allows us to combine person-centric panel data with website server data. We believe this gives our customers greater accuracy, granularity and relevance in audience measurement. 
•Our TV measurement systems, underpinned by multiple patents, which enable us to provide a consistent measurement of TV audience sizes across national, local, and addressable television to customers evaluating programming as well as customers selling and buying TV advertising. 
•An ability to de-duplicate audiences across platforms, which is based on direct observations within our consumer panel and census data combined with proprietary data science. This de-duplication allows us to measure the reach and frequency of advertising and content exposure across platforms and over time.
•An ability to capture the full content of a website or app session, which allows us to measure activity beyond page views such as purchase transactions, application submissions and product configurations.
•An ability to intelligently categorize massive amounts of web and video content, which allows us to inform targeted and brand-safe advertising.

Recent Product Investments and Releases 
Cookieless - Engineering Products in a Privacy Centric World
Our digital measurement is centered upon using first party panel data combined with additional information captured through census measurement and data partnerships. Historically, we have used cookies and mobile advertising IDs to provide additional context and scale to our digital audience measurement solutions, as well as to assist in more targeted measurement and reportability. The development of new opt-in permissions and enhanced focus on consent-based measurement provide the benefit of limiting the transfer of consumer personal information, but also mean changes to data collection and measurement processes. 
We are adopting and developing new methodologies to lead this transition to a more privacy-centric world. A key component is leveraging our capabilities in panels, which we believe give us a competitive advantage in digital and cross-platform management. In parallel, our work with existing and new partners to collaborate and test emerging solutions is intended to expand the reach of our large-scale integrations. We are creating measurement innovations designed to produce stronger products engineered for privacy, building from the pioneering UDM concept and moving toward privacy-first consented identifiers and methodologies.
We are also engaged in industry initiatives that focus on the viability and success of cross media measurement to support the "free web," which is driven by advertising investment. One of these initiatives, championed by the Association of National Advertisers ("ANA"), Google, Meta, and TikTok, is a global privacy measurement framework proposal from the World Federation of Advertisers ("WFA"). In 2021, we were selected by the ANA as a partner in their Cross-Media Measurement initiative for a pilot in measuring privacy-preserving reach and frequency measurements for television and digital media audiences, which is capable of reporting both demographics and cross-platform de-duplication. During 2022, we worked with the ANA to demonstrate that the WFA's framework for content and ad measurement can be successful and scale. 
Comscore Predictive Audiences
With third-party cookie deprecation fast approaching, advertisers need bold new solutions to ensure their campaigns continue to reach the right audiences without interruption. In 2021 we launched Predictive Audiences – a cookie-free targeting capability that enables advertisers to reach audiences based on granular consumer behavior through privacy-friendly contextual signals. This solution delivers scale and precision beyond what was previously available in the industry, and can be used across digital, mobile, and CTV campaigns.

We believe we compete favorably on these factors and that our vision and investments in the future of media measurement across platforms will deliver products and services that our customers will continue to trust and value.
Government Regulation and Privacy 
Data security and privacy laws apply to our various businesses. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents; however, increasing technology risks or unauthorized users who successfully breach our network security could misappropriate or misuse our proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services. Many countries have data protection laws with different requirements than those in the U.S., and many states in the U.S. have or are developing their own data protection and privacy requirements. This may result in inconsistent requirements and differing interpretations across jurisdictions.
Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. A number of laws have recently come into effect, and there are proposals pending before federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that have affected and are likely to continue to affect our business. For example, the European Union's ("EU") General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective in 2018, imposing more stringent EU data protection requirements and providing for greater penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators in the EU, the U.S. and elsewhere are increasingly focused on transparency, consent, consumer choice and the collection of data using tracking technologies. In the EU, cross-border data transfers are increasingly scrutinized to ensure compliance, and there have been expanded enforcement efforts in this area. Five U.S. states now have comprehensive privacy laws governing the collection and use of personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in 2020, was substantially expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which went into effect in January 2023. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act all came into effect or will come into effect in 2023. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and impose new and complex requirements on our business. Failure to comply with these laws or other privacy, data collection, data transfer or consent requirements, could result in substantial penalties and reputational harm.
We also monitor actions by the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and their state and foreign counterparts, including regulatory developments affecting Internet Service Providers, advertisers and other industry participants.
Human Capital Management
Our management of human capital is essential to the success of our company, and our management team is actively engaged in developing a strong, engaged team to execute on our business plans. 
As of January 31, 2023, we had 1,382 employees and 174 contingent providers/contractors. Our employee population, which is comprised 94% of full-time employees and 6% of part-time employees, is dispersed across the globe, as outlined below as of December 31, 2022.

Employee Engagement & Retention
The development, attraction and retention of talent is critical to the success of our business. We focus on building employee engagement; developing a positive culture of trust, transparency, learning, and involvement; and competitive pay and benefits 
Table of Contents

structures to attract and retain employees and protect the intellectual capital that we have built. We regularly review our employee turnover and satisfaction rates, and develop strategies and tactics to improve employee engagement and retention. On average, employee tenure is approximately five years, and more than 10% of our employees have been employed by our company for more than ten years. 
We seek to attract and retain the best talent from a diverse group of sources around the world, in order to meet our current and future staffing needs. In addition to a robust employee referral practice and independent outreach, we have developed relationships with universities, professional associations, and industry alliances to further increase our outreach and talent pool. In 2022, our company conducted hiring in North America, Europe, India, and Latin America.
Where feasible within the countries in which we operate, we provide a competitive and varied portfolio of healthcare, wellness, financial, and other benefit offerings to suit the diverse needs and lifestyles of our employees. Within the United States, 84% of our employee population was enrolled in one of our healthcare plans as of December 31, 2022.
We provide virtual, on-demand learning opportunities to all employees, and we also develop and deliver custom learning programs to meet specific business needs and employee interests. In 2022, approximately 80% of our employees participated in learning activities through the on-demand portal. 
We believe we have strong labor practices and employee-friendly policies that enable a culture of trust, collaboration, and compliance. Our employment standards begin and end with respect for the dignity and worth of each person. Employees have multiple avenues through which to express opinions, ideas, and concerns, which enables an open culture of communication and inclusion; our policies require that complaints are investigated and any findings are addressed. Our employees are not represented by labor unions outside of those few countries where union representation is a customary practice of doing business. The Company operates a Compliance Management System, a key component of which is mandatory training for all employees in areas including workplace harassment and our code of business conduct.
Work Environment
We believe we have created a work environment, whether in person or virtually, that represents our commitment to safety and wellness. We provide both system and technology capability as well as personal support, including wellness activities and resources, virtual social activities, and support for working parents. Supporting the person, not just the "worker," allows us to maintain business operations without endangering employees or customers. We had no safety incidents reported in 2022.
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to build and develop a workforce that reflects diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2022, over 40% of our global workforce was female and approximately 40% of our executive leaders were female. Within the United States, more than 30% of our employees identified as a person of color or as other than white. Our view is that our culture of involvement and appreciation of others enables us to more fully develop and leverage the strengths of our workforce to meet our business objectives. We place a high value on inclusion and employee-led opportunities across the Company, including the Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") which are sponsored by senior leadership but are developed and maintained by diverse groups of employees who share or champion common interests, representations, or causes. We currently have ERGs in support of LGBTQ+ persons, people of color, women, young professionals, and remote workers. We have amplified our conversation and actions relating specifically to inclusion and diversity in the last year, taking a more active executive stance and implementing learning and development initiatives, additional ERGs, virtual employee gatherings and activities, and talent acquisition opportunities.
Locations and Geographic Areas
We are located around the globe with employees in 17 countries. Our primary geographic market is the United States, followed by Asia, Europe, Latin America and Canada.
