ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

CME Group enables clients to trade futures, options, cash and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, optimize portfolios, and analyze data — empowering market participants worldwide to efficiently manage risk and capture opportunities. 
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
CME was founded in 1898 as a not-for-profit corporation. CME demutualized in 2000, and in 2002 its parent company completed its initial public offering of its Class A common stock (NASDAQ: CME). Our acquisitions include our merger with CBOT Holdings, Inc. in 2007, our acquisition of NYMEX and COMEX in 2008 and our acquisition of NEX Group plc (NEX) in November 2018. Our combination with NEX creates a leading, client-centric, global markets company, generating significant efficiencies across futures, cash and OTC products for market participants seeking to lower their cost of trading and better manage risk. It also will improve our offerings to customers through the complementary combination of CME Group’s exchange-traded derivative products and NEX’s cash and OTC products. It also expands our international footprint and global client base.
Our principal executive offices are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, and our telephone number is 312-930-1000.
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
CME Group exchanges offer the widest range of global benchmark products across all major asset classes based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange (FX), energy, agricultural commodities and metals. The company offers futures and options on futures trading across asset classes through the CME Globex platform, fixed income trading via BrokerTec and FX trading on the EBS platform. In addition, it operates one of the world’s leading central counterparty clearing providers, CME Clearing. With a range of pre- and post-trade products and services underpinning the entire lifecycle of a trade, CME Group also offers optimization, reconciliation and processing services through TriOptima and Traiana.
Derivatives Exchange Business: Through our derivatives exchanges and clearing house, we offer the widest range of global benchmark products across all major asset classes. We believe our customers choose to trade on our centralized market due to its liquidity, price transparency and technological capabilities. Market liquidity — or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently, whereby the market recovers quickly following the execution of large orders — is key to attracting customers and contributing to a market's success. Our CME Group products provide a means for hedging, speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with, among other things, interest rate sensitive instruments, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of agricultural, energy and metal commodities. 

• | CME's product slate includes agricultural, equities, FX and interest rate products, including contracts for Eurodollars and contracts based on the S&P, NASDAQ-100 and FTSE Russell Indexes.


• | CBOT's product slate consists of agricultural, equities, energy and interest rate products, including contracts for U.S. Treasury futures, corn and other grains and contracts based on the Dow Jones Industrial Index.


• | NYMEX's product slate consists of energy and metals products, including contracts for crude oil, natural gas, heating oil and gasoline.


• | COMEX's product slate consists of metals products, including contracts for gold, silver and copper.

We believe the breadth and diversity of our product lines and the variety of their underlying contracts are beneficial to our overall performance. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house.
Our CME Group products are traded primarily through CME Globex and other electronic trading platforms, by open outcry auction market in Chicago, and through privately negotiated transactions. We strive to provide the most flexible and scalable platforms to support the operational and capacity needs of the business along with the delivery of innovative technology solutions to the marketplace. Our CME Globex electronic platform is the trading engine for our central limit order book markets and is available on a global basis nearly 24 hours a day throughout the trading week. The CME Globex platform is accessible through a wide variety of vendor-provided and custom-built trading systems that benefit from our open application programming interface approach. For privately negotiated markets, we offer brokers and customers the CME Direct platform for arranging, executing, recording and risk-managing trades. CME Direct includes CME One for mobile access, CME Messenger for instant-message capabilities and CME Straight-Through Processing. CME Straight-Through Processing enables direct connectivity for trade information directly with customer order management and risk management systems and is designed to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

Together, our platforms offer:

• | certainty of execution;


• | vast capabilities to facilitate complex and demanding trading;


• | direct market access;


• | fairness, price transparency and anonymity;


• | convenience and efficiency;


• | connectivity through highly secure, resilient and low-latency network options; and


• | global distribution, including connectivity through high-speed international telecommunications hubs in key financial centers or order routing to our global partner exchanges.

We maintain comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans and facilities to provide nearly continuous availability of our markets in the event of a business disruption or disaster. We also maintain incident and crisis management plans that address responses to disruptive events.
The customer base of our derivatives exchanges includes professional traders, financial institutions, institutional and individual investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers may be members of one or more of our exchanges. Rights to directly access our derivatives markets will depend upon the nature of the customer, such as whether the entity or individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access.
U.S. trading rights and privileges are exchange-specific. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members. Membership on one of our derivatives exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees. Under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges, our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections, certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections. In 2018, 84% of our contract volume was from trades by our members. 
CME Clearing Business: Through our clearing house, CME Clearing, which is a division of CME, we provide clearing services for all of our exchange-traded contracts, for certain cleared-only products and for certain contracts traded on other exchanges. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and the soundness of our exchange markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade, becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer, and limiting counterparty credit risk. The clearing house is responsible for settling trading accounts, clearing trades, collecting and maintaining performance bond funds, regulating delivery and reporting trading data. CME Clearing marks open positions to market at least twice a day, requires payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For select cleared-only markets, positions are marked-to-market daily, with the capacity to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. The CME ClearPort front-end system provides access to our flexible clearing services for block transactions and swaps. Certain BrokerTec and EBS contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses.
The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2018. In the event a clearing firm were to withdraw, our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to one or more other clearing firms of the exchange. 
Cash Markets Business: Our cash markets business is comprised of the BrokerTec and EBS sub-brands, which were acquired as part of NEX in November 2018.

• | BrokerTec is a global electronic platform for the trading of fixed income products, with a leading position in cash U.S. Treasuries, as well as activity in European government bonds and E.U. and U.S. repo fixed income instruments. It facilitates trading principally for banks and non-bank professional trading firms.


• | EBS is a global electronic platform for the trading of FX products. It is a reliable and trusted source of executable firm liquidity across major and emerging market currencies. EBS offers anonymous and disclosed trading venues, which give clients multiple execution and distribution options and the benefit of an established and far-reaching distribution network of liquidity providers and consumers. It also offers execution of non-deliverable forwards through a CFTC-registered Swap Execution Facility. 

Optimization Business: Our optimization services, which include the Traiana and TriOptima sub-brands acquired as part of NEX, deliver transaction lifecycle management services to help our clients simplify their workflow, optimize their capital and resources, mitigate their risk, increase efficiency and reduce their operational costs and streamline complex processes.

• | Trade and portfolio management comprises portfolio and margin reconciliation, monitoring pre-trade risk and automating post-trade processing of financial transactions.


• | Financial resource optimization comprises portfolio compression, basis risk mitigation, portfolio balancing and derivative pricing and risk analytics.


• | Analytics delivers data, analytics and workflow tools that enable hedge funds and asset managers to manage their relationships with prime brokers more effectively. These tools provide a complete view of an individual hedge fund's relationships across multiple counterparties, delivering insights on counterparty credit risk, collateral management, portfolio financing and treasury. 


• | Regulatory reporting comprises trade and position reporting (including licensed MiFID agent reporting to national regulators and the public), end-to-end multi-regime regulatory reporting, data normalization, enrichment, reconciliation, validation and cross-jurisdictional matching.

Market Data Business: We offer a variety of market data services for the futures, equities, OTC, cash and the cleared swaps markets. Our market data platforms provide real-time and historical market data related to CME Group exchanges and our cash markets business. We also deliver independent market intelligence and pricing information for cash and OTC data to financial market participants using intelligence from our businesses and third parties.
Our Strategic Initiatives 
The following is a description of our strategic initiatives: 
Maximize Futures and Options on Futures Growth Globally — We continue to focus on driving growth and new customer acquisition, growing, innovating and scaling our core offerings, and increasing participation from non-U.S. customers. We do this by cross-selling our products, expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products, launching new products and services and deepening open interest in our core futures and options on futures offerings. During this decade, our key product launches have included the Ultra U.S. Treasury Bond futures and options and most recently the Ultra 10-Year Treasury futures, short-dated options across asset classes, new base metal products, expanded crude oil grades, Basis Trade at Index Close (BTIC) transactions, S&P Dividend futures, E-mini Russell 1000 and 2000 futures, and a cash-settled bitcoin futures contract. We continued to build traction in key product launches in 2018, including our Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) futures contracts, Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) futures contracts, CME FX Link, CME Eris Interest Rate Swap Futures and Physical WTI Houston Crude Oil contracts. During 2018, we experienced overall record average daily volume of 19.2 million contracts, along with multiple volume records across our core product portfolio, including interest rates, FX, agricultural commodities and metals. We also had record volume in overall options, with electronic options representing 66% of total options volume in 2018. We continued to deepen liquidity and add diverse participation as evidenced by the growth in large open interest holders with records achieved across several product lines in 2018. 
We also continued to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products. We believe we have significant opportunity to expand the participation of our non-U.S. customer base in our markets. We are focused on core growth in global markets because we believe that Australia, Asia, Latin America, and other emerging markets will experience significant growth and development of their financial markets. In addition, we continue to expand our presence in major global financial centers (including Europe), grow our business outside the United States and penetrate emerging markets, such as China, South Korea, Brazil and Mexico. In 2018, approximately 25% of our electronic futures and options on futures volume was from transactions reported as outside the United States and approximately 50% of our market data revenue was derived from outside the United States. We also achieved 42% growth in trading volume during Asian trading hours and 29% growth during European trading hours in 2018 compared to the 2017.
We continue to target cross-asset sales across client segments, driving international sales and generating new client participation across all regions. We have a long history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services well position us to help our customers adapt and comply with new regulations, while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks. We have a broad distribution network comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and front-end capabilities. 
Diversify our Business and Revenues — Our acquisition of NEX strengthens our role in the global market infrastructure, adding complementary cash and OTC businesses and scale to our listed interest rate and FX products, while enabling new efficiencies for the derivatives marketplace. The transaction positions CME Group to take direct advantage of growth in treasury issuance, liquid treasury holdings and the trading of treasury instruments, as well as growing repo activity across geographies. The transaction significantly expands CME Group’s position in the large, and highly fragmented, $5 trillion plus per trading day global FX marketplace, offering both order book trading and relationship trading solutions for customers. The acquisition adds strength in underlying customer marketplaces, especially around regional bank customers and other market 
 7

participants outside of North America. The acquisition also expands our post-trade services and market data solutions beyond futures and options on futures into cash and OTC offerings.
Our joint venture with S&P Global, Inc., S&P/DJI Indices LLC, combines the world class capabilities of S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indices, and is a significant player in the passive investing including the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry value chain. As part of the joint venture, we acquired a long-term, ownership-linked, exclusive license to list futures and options on futures based on the S&P 500 Index and certain other S&P indices.
Deliver Unparalleled Capital and Cost Efficiency Solutions — With changing regulatory capital requirements for many of our customers and the need for greater efficiencies, we have added tools to enable customers to build and manage trading and clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner, including through our acquisition of NEX. With the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the United States and in Europe, along with global implementation of Basel III capital requirements on financial institutions, we expect capital efficiencies and centralized clearing to continue to be important for our global client base.
We provide a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house. Our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral and capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives. The majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options on futures, which also represents the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions. We also offer clearing services for interest rate, FX and commodity swaps. In March 2018, we extended block trading to agricultural commodity products through CME ClearPort. Also, in 2018, we extended our OTC clearing solutions to include clearing for the Chilean and Columbian Peso interest rate swaps. 
CME Group continues to introduce tools and services to assist customers with portfolio margining. As of December 31, 2018, 45 unique marketplace participants utilized CME Group’s portfolio margining services. In the past few years, we have introduced compression via coupon blending as well as CME CORE, an interactive margin calculator that enables clients to optimize their capital by providing insights on margin requirements prior to trading. We also offer multilateral compression for our cleared swap customers through TriOptima, and we provide trade reporting services in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. In 2018, we also introduced a multilateral compression service for our listed equity options. 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
We own the rights to a large number of trademarks, service marks, domain names and trade names in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world. We have registered many of our most important trademarks in the United States and other countries. We hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications. Our patents cover match engine, trader user interface, trading floor support, market data, general technology and clearing house functionalities. We also own the copyright to a variety of materials. Those copyrights, some of which are registered, include printed and on-line publications, websites, advertisements, educational material, graphic presentations and other literature, both textual and electronic. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks, patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. 
We offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks, including S&P, NASDAQ, Dow Jones and the FTSE Russell indexes. These products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes, some of which are exclusive. In connection with our joint venture with S&P Global, Inc., we entered into a new license agreement (S&P License Agreement), which superseded our prior licensing arrangements and was assigned to the joint venture. CME’s license for the S&P 500 Index will be exclusive for futures and options on futures until one year prior to the termination of the S&P License Agreement, and non-exclusive for the last year. The license for the other S&P stock indexes is generally exclusive for futures and options on futures. The term of the S&P License Agreement will continue until the date that is one year after the date that CME Group ceases to own at least five percent (accounting for dilution) of the outstanding joint venture interests. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain terminations of the joint venture, the term may be extended up to an additional ten years. CBOT has an exclusive license agreement (Dow Jones License Agreement) with CME Group Index Services LLC (CME Indexes) for certain Dow Jones indexes, which has also been assigned to the joint venture. The initial term of the agreement is through June 30, 2026. Following the initial term, the Dow Jones License Agreement shall automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter so long as there is open interest in any of CBOT’s or its affiliates’ products based on one or more of the Dow Jones licensed indexes. In the event there is no open interest in any such products, then CME Indexes has the ability to terminate the agreement. We also have an exclusive license agreement for certain NASDAQ indexes, which was extended for an additional ten years in 2018 through 2029. In 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with FTSE Russell and launched the E-mini Russell 2000 futures in 2017. We pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements. A copy of the S&P license arrangement has been filed as a material contract.
 8

We also have a long-term, non-exclusive licensing arrangement with ICE Benchmark Administration for the use of LIBOR to settle several of our interest rate products, including our Eurodollar contract. 
We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with S&P, Dow Jones, NASDAQ and FTSE Russell or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license, or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P, Dow Jones, NASDAQ or Russell indexes, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks. Parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license, or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach and/or our licensors. 
Competition 
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global, especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV), Market Abuse Regulation, Benchmarks Regulation, Basel III, and various other laws and regulations.
Please also refer to the discussion below and in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 13 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties.
Competition in our Derivatives Exchange Business 
We believe competition in the derivatives business is based on a number of factors, including, among others: 

• | brand and reputation;


• | efficient and secure settlement, clearing and support services;


• | depth and liquidity of markets;


• | diversity of product offerings and frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services;


• | ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs;


• | efficient and seamless customer experience;


• | transparency, reliability, anonymity and security in transaction processing;


• | regulatory environment;


• | connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods, and distribution;


• | technological capability and innovation; and


• | overall transaction costs.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Our deep, liquid markets; diverse and complementary product offerings; frequency and quality of new product development, and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services, distinguish us from others in the industry. We believe that in order to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to expand globally; develop new and innovative products; enhance our technology infrastructure, including its reliability and functionality; maintain liquidity and low transaction costs; continue to strengthen our risk management capabilities and solutions, and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers. 
We compete in a large financial services trading, clearing and settlement marketplace globally. Our competitors include, among other entities, exchanges such as Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, and Deutsche Börse AG. It also includes alternative means of developing exposures through alternative instruments, such as cash, OTC, ETFs, options, warrants, contracts for differences, structured products, and other offerings. New emerging competitors have targeted different segments of our industry, and new technologies may offer alternative products in the future. Competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of well-capitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business. 
Competition in our CME Clearing Business 
In the past few years, there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with Dodd-Frank, Basel III, MiFID II and other various laws and regulations. 
 9

Our competitors in the clearing services space include, among others, companies such as ICE, LCH.Group, the Options Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Deutsche Börse AG. In light of the implementation of regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry, we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing and other related post-trade services. 
We believe competition in clearing services is based on, among other things, the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies; quality and reliability of the services; creditworthiness of the clearing house; timely delivery of the services; reputation; diversity of the service offerings; confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures, and the fees charged for the services provided.
Competition in our Cash Markets Business
The cash markets businesses operate with significant competition across a wide array of venues. In the FX space, the marketplace is highly fragmented, and there is competition from other electronic communication networks, single dealer platforms, bank owned multi-participant platforms, streaming and request for quote services, trading venues tied to data platforms, voice brokers, other broker enabled platforms, and other venues. There is a growing array of platforms, and they are often owned by many well capitalized financial institutions and intermediaries. In the fixed income space, there are also multiple providers of treasury, European and U.S. repo, and European bond trading, and a multitude of competitors and new entrants offering single dealer liquidity, bank owned multi-participant platforms, streaming and request for quote services, and other broker and exchange-enabled platforms. 
Competition in our Optimization Services Business
The optimization services business has significant competition across each of the segments in which CME Group operates. There are multiple providers of compression services, reconciliation services, trade processing, analytics, and regulatory reporting services. In addition, there is considerable innovation going on in this business, with new entrants and new technologies being developed to serve customers.
Competition in our Market Data Business 
Technology companies, market data and information vendors and front-end software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange. Distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products. Although we may receive license fees for such products, such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product.
Regulatory Matters 
Our businesses are either regulated themselves or serving a customer-base that includes regulated institutions or individuals. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly affect our businesses. As such, we are subject to extensive regulation primarily in the United States and Europe. 
In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which U.K. voters voted in favor of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), which continues to create a number of uncertainties for the financial services sector. We intend to establish certain businesses in a European Union jurisdiction, which will allow them to continue to provide services to European Union clients following Brexit. Separately, the European Commission, European Council, and European Parliament are considering legislation, EMIR 2.2, that could make changes to the E.U. equivalence and recognition regime for non-European Union clearing houses, including CME Clearing, as further discussed below. 
Please also refer to the discussion below and in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 13 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties.
Regulation of our Derivatives Business, CME Clearing and NEX SEF
Our operation of U.S. futures exchanges, CME Clearing and the NEX swap execution facility (SEF) is subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that requires our regulated subsidiaries to satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house. The CFTC carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as amended by, among others, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and Dodd-Frank. 
Regulations implementing Dodd-Frank include rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain OTC derivatives, swap reporting, operation of a clearing house, anti-manipulation, large trader reporting, product definitions, the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets, swap execution facilities and swap data repositories. We continue to believe these regulations provide opportunities for our business, which we continue to explore.
 10

CME has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization. These designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our risk-management standards, clearing and settlement activities by the CFTC and the Federal Reserve Board.
In connection with the global offering of our products and clearing services, this business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
Regulation of our Cash Markets Business
The operation of our BrokerTec platform subjects us to regulation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer and alternative trading system operator. It is also subject to regulation by authorities in the European Union as a multilateral trading facility and regulated market and by the applicable regulators in Singapore and Canada. Our EBS business holds various permissions, approvals and exemptions globally, including those that subject certain of its activities to CFTC and FCA oversight. 
Regulation of our Optimization Services Business
Certain of our optimization services, which enable clients to mitigate their risk, reduce operational costs, optimize their capital, and fulfill trade reporting obligations, are subject to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, the FCA, CFTC and the National Futures Association, ESMA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. 
Regulation of our Market Data Business
Our RepoFunds Rate suite of daily benchmarks for the euro, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, The Netherlands and Belgium are subject to the E.U. Benchmarks Regulations, and as such we are considered an approved Benchmark Administrator under the regulation. 
Key Areas of Focus
We actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry, including providing government testimony, commenting on proposed rulemakings and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace.
Our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are:

• | The potential impact of changes to the E.U. equivalence and recognition regime on non-European Union clearing houses and exchanges with customers based in Europe arising from the potential adoption of EMIR 2.2 legislation being considered by the European Commission, European Council, and European Parliament. This legislation, and the implementation of subsidiary regulations once the legislation is adopted, could require us to make changes to how our clearing house operates, subject us to greater regulatory oversight by ESMA and increase costs. A failure of our clearing house to retain its recognition may result in our clearing members and certain customers in Europe being subject to higher capital costs thus creating a disincentive to use our markets. The E.U. equivalence and recognition regime also has the potential to impact the cost and ease or difficulty for certain of NEX’s OTC execution platforms to provide access to customers on a global basis.


• | The adoption and implementation of position limit rules, which could have a significant impact on our commodities business if federal rules for position limit management differ significantly from current exchange-administered rules.


• | Rules respecting capital charges under Basel III with respect to clearing members of central counterparties may have negative implications for the cleared derivatives markets. Additional risks could arise through inconsistent adoption of the Basel III capital charges globally, potentially leading to disparate impacts on our customers. 


• | The potential for further regulation stemming from industry performance disruptions and residual concerns around electronic trading activity and, in particular, "high frequency trading."


• | The potential elimination of the 60/40 tax treatment of certain of our futures and options contracts, which would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to certain market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity.


• | The implementation of a transaction tax or user fee in the United States or European Union, or in the State of Illinois, which could discourage institutions and individuals from using our markets or products or encourage them to trade in another less costly jurisdiction. From time to time, the proposed Presidential budget, including the currently proposed budget, has included a proposal to impose a user fee to fund the CFTC. Legislation to impose a financial transaction tax has again been proposed in the Illinois General Assembly, as it has in previous sessions of the General Assembly. 

 11


• | The implementation of legislation in the European Union impacting how benchmark index prices are formed, including new requirements for price submitters, price aggregators and markets that list contracts that reference index prices.


• | Concerns that European legislators will prohibit or restrict exclusive licenses for benchmark indexes, which might impact the profitability of several of our most popular contracts.


• | The implementation of rules resulting in negative treatment of the liquidity profile of U.S. Treasury securities, including as qualifying liquidity resources, or any potential limitation on the use of U.S. Treasury securities as collateral could result in increased costs to us and our clearing firms.


• | The potential for further regulation and/or industry changes flowing from the continuing review by the official sector and industry participants of the U.S. Treasury “flash rally” of October 15, 2014 and its implications for clearing and settlement in the U.S. Treasury market.
