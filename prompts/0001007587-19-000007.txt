Mobile Connectivity Segment
The mobile connectivity segment primarily manufactures and distributes a comprehensive family of mobile satellite antenna products and services that provide access to television, the Internet and voice services while on the move. Product sales within the mobile connectivity segment accounted for 18%, 20% and 23% of our consolidated net sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Sales of mini-VSAT Broadband airtime service accounted for 41%, 41%, and 37% of our consolidated net sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Sales of content and training services within the mobile connectivity segment accounted for 17%, 20% and 20% of our consolidated net sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
In the global maritime market, we believe that there is significant demand for mobile access to television, the Internet, voice services, entertainment content, and operational services such as safety training, navigation chart updates, weather services, and voyage optimization. For both maritime and onshore customers that want to access live television while on the move, we offer a comprehensive family of mobile satellite antenna products marketed under the TracVision brand. For access to the Internet and voice services while on the move, which we refer to collectively as our airtime services, we offer a family of mobile satellite antenna products and communication services marketed under the brands mini-VSAT Broadband and TracPhone, respectively. The network infrastructure that we have developed to support our airtime services also supports the delivery of other value-added services such as our IP-MobileCast content delivery service for both entertainment and operational needs.
Our mobile satellite antenna products use sophisticated robotics, stabilization and control software, sensing technologies, transceiver integration, and advanced antenna designs to automatically search for, identify and point directly at the selected television and communications satellite while the vehicle or vessel is in motion. Our antennas use gyros and inclinometers to measure the pitch, roll and yaw of an antenna platform in relation to the earth. Microprocessors and our proprietary stabilization and control software use that data to compute the antenna movement necessary for the antenna’s motors to point the antenna properly and maintain contact with the satellite. If an obstruction temporarily blocks the satellite signal, our products continue to track the satellite’s location according to the movement of the antenna platform in order to carry out automatic, rapid reacquisition of the signal when a direct line of sight to the satellite is restored.
Our Certified Support Network offers our TracVision and TracPhone customers an international network of skilled technical dealers and support centers in many locations where our customers are likely to travel. We have selected technical dealers based on their technical expertise, professionalism, and commitment to quality, and regularly provide them with extensive training in the sale, installation and support of our products.

Maritime
In the marine market, we offer a range of mobile satellite TV, internet access, and communications products.
Satellite Phone and Internet. Our legacy mini-VSAT Broadband network offers an end-to-end solution for offshore mobile connectivity. This unified C/Ku-band Broadband service enables us to offer commercial, leisure, and government customers an integrated hardware and service solution for mobile communications and seamless region-to-region roaming. We design and manufacture the onboard TracPhone V-IP terminals, own hub equipment installed in leased earth stations, lease the satellite capacity, manage the network through third-party service providers, and provide 24/7/365 after-sale support. Because we manufacture the onboard hardware, we can integrate the full rack of discrete below decks equipment typically used on traditional VSAT systems into a single, streamlined unit that is significantly easier to deploy than competing VSAT solutions. Our mini-VSAT Broadband network primarily utilizes ArcLight spread spectrum modem technology developed by ViaSat. This spread spectrum approach reduces the broadcast power requirements and the pointing accuracy necessary to track the C- and Ku-band satellites that carry the service. The resulting efficiencies allowed us to develop and bring to market our TracPhone V-IP series of terminals. Our 60-cm diameter TracPhone V7-IP Ku-band antenna is 85% smaller by volume and 75% lighter than alternative 1-meter diameter VSAT antennas. Our 37-cm diameter TracPhone V3-IP Ku-band antenna is practical for use on smaller vessels as well as land vehicles. We believe that the TracPhone V3-IP is the smallest maritime VSAT system currently available. Our dual-mode TracPhone V11-IP antenna seamlessly tracks both C- and Ku-band satellites, making it the only 1-meter diameter maritime VSAT antenna to deliver seamless global coverage outside the far polar regions.
Advanced Next-Generation High-Throughput Satellites (HTS). In October 2017, we introduced our 60-cm diameter TracPhone V7-HTS Ku-band antenna, which is designed to deliver faster data speeds globally to the maritime market. We are able to offer download/upload speeds as fast as 10 megabits per second (Mbps)/3 Mbps by combining our proprietary antenna system design and industry-leading mini-VSAT Broadband network, along with partnering with Intelsat Epic satellite services for high throughput satellite (HTS) capabilities and additional capacity from SKY Perfect JSAT satellites. With the HTS network, we added an additional 25 million square miles to our global maritime Ku-band high-speed connectivity footprint.
In October 2018, we introduced our new 37-cm diameter TracPhone V3-HTS, which we believe is the world’s fastest, lightest, ultra-compact Ku-band marine VSAT antenna. Weighing 11 kg (25 lbs.), the TracPhone V3-HTS is smaller in physical size than any other Ku-band marine satellite communications antenna currently on the market and is designed to provide faster data speeds (5 Mbps download/2 Mbps upload) than some larger marine satellite antennas.
LTE Broadband. In June 2018, we introduced the TracPhone LTE-1, which is a high-gain dual antenna array, modem, GPS, and Wi-Fi router inside a 34-cm diameter dome. The TracPhone LTE-1 uses cellular technology from two of the leading LTE carriers in the U.S., automatically switching between them to provide Internet access in U.S. waters up to approximately 20 miles offshore, with data download speeds up to 100 Mbps. 
VSAT Deployments. We are actively engaged in sales efforts for the TracPhone V-IP and HTS Series and mini-VSAT Broadband service to government agencies for maritime, military, and emergency responder use. In September 2010, the U.S. Coast Guard awarded us a 10-year contract to supply TracPhone V7 systems and mini-VSAT Broadband airtime to as many as 216 U.S. Coast Guard cutters. As of December 31, 2018, we have supplied TracPhone V7 and V7-IP systems for 125 U.S. Coast Guard vessels. We also continue to expand our ability to support the commercial maritime market. For example, in March 2017, we completed the deployment of 99 TracPhone V7-IP systems on Pacific Basin Shipping Limited vessels to support their initiative to modernize ship-to-shore communications on their entire fleet of owned ships. In December 2018, we completed the deployment of 45 TracPhone V7-HTS systems on Transpectro oil and gas tankers. 
Other Marine Solutions. We offer CommBox, a ship-to-shore network management product that comprises shipboard hardware, a KVH-hosted or privately-owned shore-based hub, and a suite of software applications. Our CommBox offerings are generally integrated into all of our VSAT product offerings. We do not generate significant revenue from sales of standalone CommBox hardware.
We also offer Iridium OpenPort hardware and service to be used in conjunction with our mini-VSAT service. Iridium OpenPort service provides data rates up to 128 kilobits per second (Kbps) and covers the entire world, including the polar regions. We offer the Iridium hardware and service along with our own mini-VSAT solution with the integrated CommBox functionality, which will switch over to the Iridium service if the mini-VSAT service is not available. Our customers might choose to add the Iridium service to expand the geographic coverage of the system or as a backup service.

In addition to our TracPhone VSAT products and mini-VSAT Broadband service, we also offer a family of Inmarsat-compatible TracPhone products that provide in-motion access to global satellite communications. These products rely on services offered by Inmarsat, a satellite service provider that supports links for phone, fax, and data communications as fast as 432 Kbps. The TracPhone FB150, FB250, FB500, and FleetOne antennas use the Inmarsat FleetBroadband service to offer voice and Internet service. The TracPhone FB150, FB250, FB500 and FleetOne products are manufactured by Thrane & Thrane A/S of Denmark (acquired by Cobham) and distributed on an OEM basis by us in North America under our TracPhone brand and distributed in other markets on a non-exclusive basis.
Unlike mini-VSAT Broadband, where we control and sell the airtime, we purchase Inmarsat and Iridium airtime directly from these companies and resell it to our customers.
Satellite TV. Our TracVision TV-series satellite TV antennas are designed with the full spectrum of vessel sizes in mind, ranging from recreational vessels as small as 20 to 25 feet to large commercial vessels. The TV-series incorporate an Internet Protocol (IP)-enabled control unit to allow access to system information from any Wi-Fi device. Our family of marine TracVision products includes the 32-cm diameter TracVision TV1, 37-cm diameter TracVision TV3, 45-cm diameter TracVision TV5, 60-cm diameter TracVision TV6, and 81-cm TracVision TV8. These products are compatible with Ku-band SDTV and HDTV programming as well as high-powered regional satellite TV services around the globe, based on available signal strength and antenna size requirements. 
Our TracVision HD-series satellite TV antennas are designed to offer a high definition TV experience comparable to that available to a home DIRECTV HDTV subscriber. Our TracVision HD7 uses a 61-cm diameter satellite TV antenna to receive signals from two DIRECTV Ka-band satellites and one DIRECTV Ku-band satellite simultaneously. It includes an IP-enabled antenna control unit as well as an optional antenna control unit via a free TracVision application for use on an Apple iPhone or iPad. We believe the TracVision HD7 was the first marine antenna to offer this combination of capabilities. Our TracVision HD11 offers a worldwide satellite TV capability through the use of a 1-meter diameter antenna and a global low noise block (LNB) designed for use with the majority of direct-to-home satellite TV services. As a result, it is able to receive all Ku-band and DIRECTV Ka-band satellite television signals without changing hardware elements. The Ku-band also works with modern satellite television services currently available throughout the world. The Ka-band receives DIRECTV HDTV. Like the TracVision HD7, the TracVision HD11 features an optional application for the Apple iPhone or iPad to provide easy control of the system.
Land Mobile
We design, manufacture, and sell a range of TracVision satellite TV antenna systems for use on a broad array of vehicles, including recreational vehicles (RV), buses, conversion vans, and automobiles.
In the RV and bus markets, we offer TracVision satellite TV products, intended for both stationary and in-motion use. Our TracVision R1 delivers DIRECTV or DISH network service through a small 32-cm diameter dome. Our TracVision A9 uses hybrid phased-array antenna technology to provide in-motion reception of satellite TV programming in the continental United States using either the DIRECTV or DISH Network services. The TracVision A9 stands approximately five inches high and mounts either to a vehicle’s roof rack or directly to the vehicle’s roof, making it practical for use aboard minivans, SUVs and other passenger vehicles. The TracVision A9 includes a mobile satellite television antenna and an IP-enabled TV hub for easy system configuration and control via Wi-Fi devices, such as an Apple iPhone or iPad. The TracVision A9 is also suitable for tall motor coaches and buses. Automotive customers subscribe to DIRECTV’s TOTAL CHOICE MOBILE satellite TV programming package, which is specifically promoted for automotive applications, or to DISH Network programming.

Airtime Services
In addition to our mobile satellite antenna hardware and software, we offer airtime plans that enable customers to obtain Internet and voice services. We offer a variety of rate plans that typically require an initial commitment of one or more years with a one-year auto-renewal feature in which customers can terminate their contract upon 60 days' notice. Since October 2015, we have offered mini-VSAT Broadband 2.0, our second generation mini-VSAT service. The key features of the mini-VSAT Broadband 2.0 service are usage-based airtime plans, a network management portal and a comprehensive global customer support program. Our usage-based plans are designed around each vessel's monthly data requirements for operational and crew needs. Our network management portal, myKVH, is a secure portal that enables a ship operator to manage network usage by vessel or by individual crew members by allocating operational and crew data caps while receiving customized usage alerts. For customers that want the certainty of a fixed monthly price, we offer fixed rate plans that vary depending on data speeds and include protocol restrictions, such as limiting streaming of video content. User speeds are also restricted but not stopped when users reach established data use thresholds. In addition, we offer multiple usage plans that are either billed monthly based on the data consumed without any application or protocol blocking or based on a monthly minimum data quota with the option to add more data for an incremental charge. The TracPhone V3-IP requires a usage-based plan while the TracPhone V7-IP and V11-IP can support any plan.
In April 2017, we launched a new mini-VSAT Broadband service offering, AgilePlans. AgilePlans is our all-inclusive connectivity-as-a-service, or CaaS, usage-based pricing model for commercial maritime customers of our mini-VSAT broadband service. Under this CaaS model, we charge subscribers a monthly fee in exchange for which we provide satellite communication hardware, shipping and installation, maintenance and support, airtime and voice services, a service management portal and certain basic content services with no minimum commitment. We offer AgilePlan customers a variety of airtime data plans with varying data allotments and fixed data usage levels with overage charges per megabyte, which is similar to the plans that we offer to our other customers. Under our CaaS model, we retain ownership of our satellite equipment and do not sell it to subscribers, who must return the hardware to us if they terminate our service. We anticipate that, to the extent that customers adopt this subscription model, our revenues from product sales will continue to decline, and our provision of this equipment to subscribers will continue to increase our capital expenditures, which over time will continue to increase our costs of service sales as we depreciate these assets. 
The bandwidth speeds offered by the Ku-band satellites also permit faster data rates than those supported by Inmarsat’s L-band satellites. TracPhone V11-IP customers may select service packages with Internet data connections offering shore-to-ship satellite data rates as fast as 4 Mbps, and ship-to-shore satellite data rates as fast as 1 Mbps. The V7-IP offers shore-to-ship satellite data rates as fast as 3 Mbps and ship-to-shore data rates as fast as 512 Kbps. The TracPhone V3-IP, due to its smaller dish diameter, offers shore-to-ship satellite data rates as fast as 2 Mbps and ship-to-shore data rates as fast as 128 Kbps. In addition, subscriptions include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone services designed for use over satellite connections. The TracPhone V11-IP and V7-IP can support two or more simultaneous calls while the TracPhone V3-IP can support one call at a time.    
Our legacy mini-VSAT Broadband network currently uses a combination of 23 Ku-band transponders on 19 satellites to provide Ku-band coverage throughout the northern hemisphere, around the continents in the southern hemisphere, and C-band coverage world-wide. Of the 23 Ku-band transponders, we directly contract for eight as of January 1, 2019, and we directly contract for three global C-band transponders. The remaining Ku-band transponders are contracted by ViaSat. Under the terms of our revenue-sharing arrangement with ViaSat, expansions of our ViaSat network position us to earn revenue not only from the maritime and land-based use of the mini-VSAT Broadband service but also from aeronautical platforms that roam throughout our network. In November 2018, we renewed our contract with ViaSat until the end of 2021. The new contract includes an obligation to make certain minimum quarterly payments to ViaSat that generally decline over the contract period. After this contract period, a one-year notice is required to terminate the agreement. As part of the agreement, starting January 1, 2019, we reduced the number of Ku-band transponders which we directly contract for from 14 to eight. 
In October 2017, we launched our next-generation, advanced maritime broadband network with Intelsat. The HTS high-speed network complements our first-generation mini-VSAT Broadband network with three to six times the data speeds available to maritime customers. At the core of its capabilities, our advanced maritime broadband network incorporates Intelsat Epic satellite services and the award-winning IntelsatOne Flex platform, a global managed service designed to optimize bandwidth allocations and provide flexible coverage where it is needed. Our mini-VSAT Broadband network also benefits from increased Asian satellite capacity provided by SKY Perfect JSAT. Overall, our mini-VSAT Broadband HTS network currently uses a combination of 88 Ku-band transponders (five of which we directly contract for) on 14 satellites to provide Ku-band coverage throughout the northern and southern hemispheres. Two of the 14 satellites are considered high-throughput satellites that provide coverage via overlapping high-powered spot beams. Sixty-one of the 88 Ku-band transponders are served by the high-throughput satellites. During the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a five-year capital lease for three satellite hubs for the HTS network. It is our long-term plan to continue to maintain and enhance our mini-VSAT Broadband network.

In addition, we offer professional services for our VSAT products that include network design, installation of onboard TracPhone terminals and custom configuration of the CommBox based on customer requirements. These services are performed by our employees as well as a dealer network of certified engineers.
Content and Training Services
As part of our mobile connectivity segment, we offer a variety of value-added services to our maritime customers as well as news content to our hotel customers and radio content to a small number of retail customers. The vast majority of these value-added services are subscription-based. 
Our KVH Media Group, which is based in the United Kingdom, distributes commercially licensed entertainment, including news, sports, music, and movies, to commercial and leisure customers in the maritime, hotel, and retail markets. Sales from KVH Media Group are included in our mobile connectivity service sales as part of content and training service sales. Our "news from home" digital newspaper service includes more than 100 daily newspapers in more than 20 languages that at the end of 2018 was delivered to more than 9,000 commercial ships, hotels, and cruise ships. The digital content can be printed onboard or viewed on a tablet, smartphone, or laptop. For movie content, we are an approved distributor of licensed content for certain major Hollywood, Bollywood, and independent studios. For television content, we are an approved distributor for certain major TV studios worldwide. 
Our Videotel division is a leading provider of high-quality training films and eLearning services for the commercial maritime industry. Servicing close to 12,000 fielded training systems at the end of 2018, Videotel offers video, animation, eLearning computer-based training and interactive distance learning services through its Videotel Performance Manager service, which includes its Practical Engineering suite of content. Certification and refresher courses are mandated by international regulations. Sales from Videotel are included in our mobile connectivity service sales as part of content and training service sales.
We offer a content delivery service called IP-MobileCast through which content and data files are transmitted using multicast technology across our global satellite networks to every vessel or mobile vehicle that has an active, compatible TracPhone V series, V-IP series, or V-HTS series terminal. This delivery mechanism reduces the amount of bandwidth required to transmit large files to a large population of customers. Before multicasting, large data files were generally transmitted across satellite networks “on demand” or unicast, which consumes significant bandwidth. The content is either stored on the terminal itself or on a KVH-supplied media server, which is required for digital rights managed content such as movies and Videotel content. Copyright law requires permission from the rights holder for exhibitions of copyrighted film and television. Historically, studios have granted KVH Media Group permission to license non-theatrical exhibitions aboard ships. While traditionally we licensed this content to commercial maritime customers primarily through the distribution of DVDs, we have now also automated the transmission of this type of entertainment via IP-MobileCast. 
Customers that subscribe to one of our entertainment packages generally receive a variety of movie and television content that is cached locally onboard. We transmit approximately 800 local "news from home" and international news segments in a variety of languages on a monthly basis, at least 20 movies per month plus daily sports, news clips and special programming such as the highlights of sporting events. 
We also offer a variety of operational services through IP-MobileCast. Subscribers to the Videotel training and eLearning content can also receive new content over the IP-MobileCast network through TRAININGlink, whereby customers receive new content more frequently than once a year. As part of our CHARTlink service, we transmit electronic chart updates for ECDIS solution providers Transas and Jeppesen. For our FORECASTlink service, we transmit global forecasts and high-resolution weather data provided by StormGeo (previously AWT). Our charting and weather forecasting services provide critical content for voyage optimization.

Inertial Navigation Segment
We offer a portfolio of digital compass and fiber optic gyro (FOG)-based systems that address the rigorous requirements of military and commercial customers. Our systems provide reliable, easy-to-use and continuously available navigation and pointing data. Our guidance and stabilization products include our FOG-based inertial measurement units (IMUs) for precision guidance, FOGs for tactical navigation as well as pointing and stabilization systems, and digital compasses that provide accurate heading information for demanding applications. Sales of FOG-based guidance and navigation systems within the inertial navigation segment accounted for 16%, 13%, and 10% of our consolidated net sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Sales of tactical guidance and navigation systems within the inertial navigation segment accounted for 3%, 3%, and 8% of our consolidated net sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Guidance and Stabilization
Our high-performance digital signal processing (DSP)-based FOG products use an all-fiber design that has no moving parts, resulting in an affordable combination of precision, accuracy, and durability. Our FOG products support a broad range of military applications, including stabilization of remote weapons stations, antennas, radar, optical devices, or turrets; image stabilization and synchronization for shoulder-or tripod-mounted weapon simulators; precision tactical navigation systems for military vehicles, and guidance for weapons and unmanned autonomous vehicles. Our FOG products are also used in numerous commercial products, such as navigation and positioning systems for various applications including precision mapping, dynamic surveying, autonomous vehicles, train location control and track geometry measurement systems, industrial robotics, and optical stabilization. 
The CG-5100, our first commercial-grade IMU, is suitable for a wide range of applications such as 3D augmented reality, mobile mapping, platform navigation, and GPS augmentation for unmanned vehicle programs, precise mapping, and imagery.
Our CNS-5000 continuous navigation system is a self-contained navigation system that combines our FOG-based inertial measurement technology with GPS technology from NovAtel. This navigation solution provides precise position and orientation of a host platform on a continuous basis, even during periods where GPS signals are blocked by natural or man-made obstructions or conditions. The CNS-5000 is designed for demanding commercial applications, such as dynamic surveying, mobile mapping, precision agriculture, container terminal management, and autonomous vehicle navigation, where the ability to determine the precise position and orientation of a piece of equipment or a mobile platform is critical. The CNS-5000 is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product consisting of a FOG-based inertial measurement unit tightly integrated with GPS within a single enclosure. This design reduces the operational complexities for customers whose products cross international boundaries.
Our open-loop DSP-1750, DSP-3000, and DSP-4000 FOGs provide precision measurement of the rate and angle of a platform’s turning motion for significantly less cost than competing closed-loop gyros. These DSP-based products deliver performance superior to analog signal processing devices, which experience greater temperature-sensitive drift and rotation errors. Applications for these products include inertial measurement units, integrated navigation systems, attitude/heading/reference systems, and stabilization of antenna, radar, and optical equipment.
The DSP-1750, which we believe to be the world’s smallest high-performance FOG, uses our E·CoreTM ThinFiber technology. This thin fiber, which is created at our Tinley Park, Illinois manufacturing facility, is only 170 microns in diameter, enabling longer lengths of fiber to be wound into smaller housings. Since the length of the fiber used in a FOG directly relates to gyro accuracy and performance, this technology enables us to produce smaller and more accurate gyros. The small size and weight of the DSP-1750 make it well suited for applications with size and weight restrictions, such as night vision and thermal imaging systems, aircraft-mounted gimbaled cameras for law enforcement and homeland security, and shipboard optical systems.
Our DSP-1760 single-axis and multi-axis FOGs offer improved performance and ease of integration relative to the DSP-1750. Many customers using our DSP-1750 single-axis and dual-axis FOGs also had requirements for packaged DSP-1750s. To address this demand, we introduced the DSP-1760 product line, consisting of packaged one, two, or three axes of FOGs, each with two different interface connector options.
9

The DSP-3000, DSP-3100, and DSP-3400 are each slightly larger than a deck of playing cards and offers a variety of interface options to support a range of applications. High-performance 2-axis and 3-axis configurations can be realized by integrating multiple DSP-3000 and DSP-3100 units. Currently, the DSP-3000, DSP-3100, and DSP-3400 are used in an array of pointing and stabilization applications, including the U.S. Army’s Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) to provide the image and gun stabilization necessary to ensure that the weapon remains aimed at its target. We estimate that more than 20 companies have developed or are developing stabilized remote weapons stations that we believe will require similar FOG stabilization capabilities. The larger, militarized dual axis DSP-4000 is designed for use in high-shock and highly dynamic environments, such as gun turret stabilization.
Our 1750 IMU is an advanced 6-degrees-of-freedom sensor designed to integrate easily into the most demanding stabilization, pointing, and navigation applications. It offers enhanced performance at a lower cost than competing systems. The 1750 IMU marries the E·Core ThinFiber technology of our DSP-1750 FOGs with very low noise, solid state MEMS accelerometers to create a commercial-off-the-shelf IMU. Our 1775 IMU and 1725 IMU products complement the 1750 IMU and provide customers with a range of choices for advanced 6-degrees-of-freedom sensors. The family of IMUs offers exceptional precision in a very small form factor, making them suitable for applications where space is limited, such as manned and unmanned commercial and defense platforms, optical equipment stabilization systems, pipeline inspection equipment, and autonomous vehicle control and navigation systems. 
In January 2016, we introduced the GEO-FOG 3D and GEO-FOG 3D Dual inertial navigation systems that offers roll, pitch and heading accuracies of 0.05 degrees for demanding applications in unmanned, autonomous and manned aerial platforms. These systems combine our 1750 IMU technology with centimeter-level precise GNSS receivers, a 3-axis magnetometer and a barometric pressure sensor. 
In June 2018, we introduced a version of the 1775 IMU that includes 25g accelerometers. This version is designed for applications with high levels of acceleration, vibration, or shock. These applications include positioning and navigation systems for drilling, mining, and pipeline inspection and maintenance; mobile mapping systems using multiple sensors such as radar, cameras, and LIDAR; high-speed gimbals; and manned and unmanned platform stabilization and navigation systems.
Tactical Navigation
Our TACNAV® tactical navigation product line employs digital compass sensors and KVH FOGs to offer vehicle-based navigation and pointing systems with a range of capabilities, including GPS backup and enhancement, vehicle position, hull azimuth and navigation displays. Because our digital compass products measure the earth’s magnetic field rather than detect satellite signals from the GPS, they are not susceptible to GPS jamming devices.
TACNAV systems vary in size and complexity to suit a wide range of vehicles. Our TACNAV Light, including a version with embedded GPS, is low-cost, digital compass-based battlefield navigation system specifically designed for non-turreted vehicles, such as high mobility multi-wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs) and trucks. Our TACNAV TLS, a digital compass-based tactical navigation and targeting system, offers a FOG upgrade for enhanced accuracy designed for turreted vehicles, including reconnaissance vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and light armored vehicles. Our TACNAV II Fiber Optic Gyro Navigation system offers a compact design, continuous output of heading and pointing data, and a flexible architecture that allows it to function as either a stand-alone navigation module or as the central component of an expanded, multifunctional navigation system. Our FOG-based TACNAV 3D product provides full three-dimensional navigation. The TACNAV 3D is fitted with an Iridium transceiver to transmit and receive vehicle position, waypoint, and target location to or from a command center or other vehicle. The system also allows messages to be received from battlefield management systems. The TACNAV Moving Map Display offers real-time moving map technology and an easy-to-use graphical navigation capability for military vehicles. It is compatible with existing and future TACNAV systems, provides a high-bright display for outdoor viewing, and dims to support low-light tactical operations.
Our navigation systems function as standalone tools and also aggregate, integrate, and communicate critical information from a variety of on-board systems. TACNAV can receive data from systems such as the vehicle’s odometer, military and commercial GPS devices, laser rangefinders, turret angle indicators and laser warning systems. TACNAV can also output this data to an on-board computer for retransmission through the vehicle’s communications systems to a digital battlefield management application.
Our TACNAV digital compass products have been sold for use aboard U.S. Army, Marine Corps, and Navy vehicles as well as to many foreign countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Switzerland. We believe that we are among the leading manufacturers of such systems. Our standard TACNAV products can be customized to our customers’ specifications.

Backlog
Backlog is not a meaningful indicator for predicting revenue in future periods. Commercial resellers for our mobile connectivity products and legacy products typically do not carry extensive inventories and rely on us to ship products quickly. Generally, due to the rapid delivery of our commercial products, our backlog for those products is not significant. However, as of December 31, 2018, we had over 200 TracPhone V7-HTS units in backlog to be shipped through 2020.
Our backlog for all products and services was $14.5 million, $16.3 million, and $8.9 million on December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, $10.5 million of our backlog was scheduled for fulfillment in 2019 and $4.0 million was scheduled for fulfillment in 2020 through 2028. The decrease in backlog of $1.8 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of a $2.2 million decrease in TACNAV product orders and a $1.7 million decrease in contracted engineering services, which were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in mobile connectivity product orders, and a $0.2 million increase in FOG product orders. The increase in backlog of $7.4 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a $6.0 million increase in FOG product orders, a $2.3 million increase in contracted engineering services, and a $0.9 million increase in TACNAV product orders, partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in mobile connectivity product orders. 
Backlog consists of orders evidenced by written agreements and specified delivery dates for customers who are acceptable credit risks. We do not include satellite connectivity or media content service sales in our backlog even though many of our satellite connectivity and media content customers have signed annual or multi-year service contracts providing for a fixed monthly fee. Military orders included in backlog are generally subject to cancellation for the convenience of the customer. When orders are canceled, we generally recover actual costs incurred through the date of cancellation and the costs resulting from termination. As of December 31, 2018, our backlog included $5.9 million in orders that are subject to cancellation for convenience by the customer. Individual orders for inertial navigation products are often large and may require procurement of specialized long-lead components and allocation of manufacturing resources. The complexity of planning and executing larger orders generally requires customers to order well in advance of the required delivery date, resulting in backlog.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on our ability to protect our proprietary information. We rely primarily on patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. We own 24 U.S. and foreign patents and have 16 additional patent applications that are currently pending. We also register our trademarks in the United States and other key markets where we do business. Our patents will expire at various dates between July 2020 and November 2034. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants, key employees, and sales representatives and maintain controls over access to and distribution of our technology, software, and other proprietary information. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us.
We do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies.
From time to time, we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technologies infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and we may face similar claims in the future. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against or settling the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products is found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Manufacturing
Manufacturing operations for our mobile satellite communications and navigation products consist of light manufacture, final assembly and testing. Manufacturing operations for our FOG products are more complex. We produce specialized optical fiber, FOG components and sensing coils and combine them with components purchased from outside vendors for assembly into finished goods. These finished goods undergo extensive calibration and verification over temperature and rotation before shipping to customers. We own optical fiber drawing towers with which we produce the specialized optical fiber that we use in all of our FOG products. We manufacture, warehouse and distribute our mobile satellite communications products at our facilities in Middletown, Rhode Island. We manufacture our navigation and FOG products in our facility located in Tinley Park, Illinois. Our manufacturing processes are controlled by an ISO 9001:2015-certified quality standards program.
For subscribers of the Videotel maritime safety video and computer-based training modules, we provide computer hardware preloaded with the content, a VOD kiosk, which is updated at least annually by flash drive. We use two contract manufacturers in the United Kingdom to supply the VOD kiosks.
Raw Materials, Components and Services

We purchase raw materials and most of the components used in our various manufacturing processes, such as printed circuit boards, injection-molded plastic parts, machined metal components, connectors and housings. In addition, we purchase certain services, predominantly networking and mobile broadband services, to support the delivery of our mobile communications solutions.
The materials, molds and dies, subassemblies and components purchased from other manufacturers, and other materials and supplies used in our manufacturing processes have generally been available from a variety of sources. We believe there are a number of acceptable vendors for the components we purchase. We regularly evaluate both domestic and foreign suppliers for quality, dependability and cost effectiveness. From time to time the cost and availability of materials and services is affected by the demands of other industries, among other factors. Whenever practical, we seek to establish multiple sources for the purchase of raw materials, components and services to achieve competitive pricing, maintain flexibility, reduced tariff exposure, and protect against supply disruption. When possible, we employ a company-wide procurement strategy designed to reduce the purchase price of materials, purchased components and services.
For reasons of quality assurance, scarcity or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products, as well as certain services utilized in the delivery of our solutions, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole source supplier. We work with our suppliers to develop contingency plans intended to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Due to the nature of certain raw materials, purchased components and services, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components, materials or services. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components or unable to obtain sufficient access to the services needed to deliver our solutions on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture and deliver our products and services on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations due to supplier limitations.

Competition
We encounter significant competition in the markets we serve, and we expect this competition to intensify in the future. Many of our primary competitors are well-established companies and some have substantially greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing, operational, and other resources than we do.
In the marine market for satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, RayMarine (Intellian made), KNS, and Sea King (King Controls).
In the marine market for voice, fax, data, and Internet communications equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, Jotron AS, KNS Inc., Inmarsat, AddValue, and Iridium Satellite LLC.
In the marine market for high-speed voice, fax, data, and Internet services, we compete primarily with Inmarsat, Marlink, Speedcast, Network Innovations, and Global Eagle Entertainment. We also face competition from providers of low-speed data services, which include Inmarsat, Globalstar LP, and Iridium Satellite LLC. 
In the market for land mobile satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with King Controls and Winegard Company.
In the markets for media content, we compete primarily with Swank Motion Pictures and Newspapersdirect Inc.
In the markets for safety and eLearning content, we compete primarily with Seagull AS.
In the markets for mobile satellite connectivity technology, the principal competitive factors are product size, features, design, performance, reliability, and price. In the markets for airtime services, the principal competitive factors are geographic coverage, data speed, value-added services, and price. In the markets for media content, the principal competitive factors are license rights, distribution, and price.
In the inertial navigation markets, we compete primarily with Honeywell International Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Goodrich Aerospace, IAI, Fizoptica, SAGEM, and Systron Donner Inertial. We believe the principal competitive factors in these markets are performance, size, reliability, durability, and price.
Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so. We encounter substantial competition in most of our product lines, although no single competitor competes with us across all product lines.

Research and Development
Focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace. Our research and development efforts are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products and services that are central to our core business strategy. The industries in which we compete are subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and new product and service introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products and services that improve performance and meet customers’ operational and cost requirements. Our current research and development efforts include projects to achieve additional cost reductions in our products and the development of new products and services for our existing marine and land mobile communications markets, and navigation, guidance, and stabilization application markets. For example: 

• | In June 2018, we released the TracPhone LTE-1, which uses cellular technology from two of the leading LTE carriers in the U.S., automatically switching between them to provide Internet access in U.S. waters up to approximately 20 miles offshore, with data download speeds up to 100 Mbps.


• | In June 2018, we also released a version of the 1775 IMU that includes 25g accelerometers. This version is designed for highly dynamic applications, or applications with high levels of acceleration, vibration, or shock.


• | In October 2018, we released the TracPhone V3-HTS, which similar to the TracPhone V7-HTS that was released in October 2017 utilizes our HTS services to provide higher speed Internet services to our customers.


• | We continued to develop our Photonics Integrated Chip, a key component in a low-cost FOG for the self-driving automobile market.

Our research and development activities consist of projects funded by us and projects funded partly by customers. Our customer-funded research efforts are made up of contracts with defense and OEM customers, whose performance specifications are unique to their product applications. Defense and OEM research often results in new product offerings. We strive to be the first company to bring a new product to market, and we use our own funds to accelerate new product development efforts.
Government Regulation
Our manufacturing operations are subject to various laws governing the protection of the environment and our employees. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to improve our technologies, incur expenditures, or both, in order to comply with such laws and regulations.
We are subject to compliance with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations. Some of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the Munitions List of the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations. These products require an individual validated license to be exported to certain jurisdictions. The length of time involved in the licensing process varies and can result in delays of the shipping of the products. Sales of our products to either the U.S. government or its prime contractors are subject to the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations.
We are also subject to the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we offer and sell our satellite communication products and services, including those of the European Union, Brazil, Norway, Singapore, and Japan. These laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations, are subject to change and any such change may affect our ability to offer and sell existing and planned satellite communications products and services.

Employees
On December 31, 2018, we employed 715 total employees, including 630 full-time employees. We employ part-time employees as well as temporary or contract personnel, when necessary, to provide short-term and/or specialized support for production and other functional projects.
We believe our future success will depend upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Working Capital and Seasonality
We hold significant inventory to support our customers and provide prompt delivery of finished goods. As a consequence, we expend substantial working capital in advance of receipt of customer orders. Because of the large size of certain orders, we often incur significant receivables upon order fulfillment.
Our leisure marine business within the mobile connectivity segment is highly seasonal, and seasonality can also impact our commercial marine business. Historically, we have generated the majority of our marine leisure product revenues during the first and second quarters of each year, and these revenues typically decline in the third and fourth quarters of each year. Temporary suspensions of our airtime services typically increase in the third and fourth quarters of each year as boats are placed out of service during the winter months.
