ITEM 1.BUSINESS 
Our Company
El Pollo Loco is Spanish for “The Crazy Chicken.” We opened our first location on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, California, in 1980, and have grown our restaurant system to 490 restaurants, comprised of 188 company-operated and 302 franchised restaurants as of December 28, 2022. Our restaurants are located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Utah, Colorado and Louisiana. Our typical restaurant is a free-standing building with drive-thru service that ranges in size from 2,200 to 3,000 square feet with seating for approximately 50-70 people.
El Pollo Loco is a differentiated and growing restaurant concept that specializes in fire-grilling citrus-marinated chicken and operates in the limited service restaurant (“LSR”) segment. We strive to offer food that integrates the culinary traditions of Mexico with the healthier lifestyle of Los Angeles. Our distinctive menu features our signature product, citrus-marinated fire-grilled chicken, as well as a variety of Mexican and LA-inspired entrees that we create from our chicken. We serve individual and family-sized chicken meals, a variety of Mexican and LA-inspired entrees and sides, and, throughout the year, on a limited-time basis, additional proteins like beef. Our entrees include favorites such as our Chicken Avocado Burrito, Pollo Fit entrees, chicken tostada salads, and Pollo Bowls. Our famous Creamy Cilantro dressings and salsas are prepared fresh daily, allowing our customers to create their favorite flavor profiles to enhance their culinary experience. Our distinctive menu with “better for you” and more affordable healthier alternatives appeals to consumers across a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds and drives our balanced composition of sales throughout the day (our “day-part mix”), including at lunch and dinner.
The Company operates in one operating segment. All significant revenues relate to retail sales of food and beverages through either company or franchised restaurants. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and expenses for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, and our total assets as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, is included in our “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Market Trends and Uncertainties
We may face future business disruption and related risks resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or from another pandemic, epidemic or infectious disease outbreak, or from broader macroeconomic trends, any of which could have a significant impact on our business. During the year ended December 28, 2022, we incurred $3.3 million in COVID-19 related expenses, comprised of $2.3 million due to overtime primarily related to the first quarter and $1.0 million due to leaves of absence related to the remaining three quarters. During the year ended December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020, we incurred $3.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in COVID-19 related expenses, primarily due to leaves of absence and overtime pay. In addition, while all of our restaurants had dining rooms open as of December 28, 2022, we continue to experience staffing challenges, including higher wage inflation, overtime costs and other labor related costs. Labor costs could also be adversely impacted as a result of California Assembly Bill No. 257, the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act (“FAST Act”), which was signed into law in September 2022 and authorizes the creation of a council to set minimum standards for industry workers in California, including minimum wages. The FAST Act, which will take effect if approved by voters in November 2024, could result in increased labor cost at our California restaurants thereby potentially impacting the profitability of our California restaurants. Further, this bill could prompt similar legislation in other states. We also continue to experience inflationary pressures, which resulted in increased commodity prices and impacted our business and results of operations during the year ended December 28, 2022. We expect these pressures to continue during fiscal year 2023.
Due to the fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic and current macroeconomic environment, we cannot determine the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic (and its related economic impacts) and the current macroeconomic environment will have on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations, and therefore 

2




any prediction as to the ultimate materiality of the adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations is uncertain.
Our Industry
The restaurant industry is divided into two segments: full service and limited service. We operate within the broader LSR segment, and we strive to offer the food and dining experience of a fast-casual restaurant and the speed, value, and convenience of a quick-service restaurant (“QSR”). We strive to offer menu options that are made with fresh ingredients and provide a “better for you” alternative to typical fast food, which are also inspired by the culinary and cultural traditions of Mexico and our hometown of Los Angeles.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our continued growth:
Differentiated Restaurant Concept with Broad Appeal. We believe that our food, which combines the culinary traditions of Mexico with the healthier lifestyle of Los Angeles, served in contemporary restaurant environments at reasonable prices, positions us well to satisfy the needs of our core Hispanic family market and appeal to the broader general market who seek convenient and high-quality meals at reasonable prices. We provide our customers with the opportunity to enjoy citrus-marinated, fire-grilled chicken and Mexican-inspired entrees containing distinctive ingredients such as avocados, organic greens and serrano peppers at price points that appeal to a broad consumer base. We believe that our entree prices are typically lower than the fast-casual segment, and a slight premium to the QSR segment. We prepare our entrees to order in approximately four minutes and allow our customers the option to create their favorite flavor profiles using our freshly-prepared salsas before they enjoy their meals in our dining rooms or take their meals to go from the counter or the drive-thru. We also believe that our concept, which integrates the complexity of creating real food in real kitchens with the speed of our service model and the skill of our trained Grill Masters, provides a layer of competitive insulation around our restaurant model. We believe that our positioning appeals to a broad customer base, and that our brand crosses over traditional age, ethnic, and income demographics, giving consumers the best of both the fast-casual and QSR segments. We seek to position ourselves as a differentiated restaurant concept, which we believe sources traffic from both dining segments and, as a result, we expect it to drive transaction growth in the future.
Mexican-Inspired, Fresh-Made Fire-Grilled Chicken and Entrees. Our signature product is our chicken, marinated with a proprietary recipe of citrus juice, garlic, and spices, which serves as the foundation of our distinctive menu of flavorful bone-in chicken meals and entrees inspired by Mexico and LA. With menu items such as our signature individual chicken meals, family dinners, Chicken Tostada Salad, Pollo Bowl®, Chicken Avocado Burrito, and Double Chicken Avocado Salad, we believe that we offer our customers a “better for you” alternative to traditional food on-the-go. Our entrees are prepared using fresh ingredients with recipes inspired by Mexican cuisine. The majority of our menu items are prepared in-restaurant using fresh ingredients, including our bone-in chicken and chicken breast filets, rice, salsas, and cilantro dressing. These items start with our chicken, which is marinated in our restaurants daily. From there, our Grill Masters fire-grill and hand-chop our chicken to order. Our team members create our salsas, and cilantro dressings with fresh tomatoes, avocados, serrano peppers, and cilantro. In addition, our rice is seasoned and simmered in our restaurants throughout each day.
Our bone-in chicken meals and Mexican-inspired entrees accounted for 44% and 50% of our company-operated restaurant sales in 2022, respectively, 46% and 48%, respectively, in 2021, and 46% and 47%, respectively, in 2020. Our individual and family-sized chicken meals appeal to customers looking to dine at the restaurant or take out during dinnertime, while our Mexican-inspired entrees draw traffic from customers at lunchtime or for an afternoon snack, thereby enabling us to generate sales split almost equally between lunch and dinner. We believe that our family-sized chicken meals provide a “better for you” and more convenient alternative for families looking to solve the “dinnertime dilemma” of providing their families with high-quality meals without investing significant time or money. In 2022 approximately 28% of our company-operated sales were generated from family-sized meals, compared to 31% in both 2021 and 2020.
Operations Infrastructure that Allows for Real-Time Control, Fast Feedback, and Innovation. We believe that satisfying our customers’ dining needs is the foundation for our business, and we have an operations platform that allows us to measure our performance in meeting and exceeding those needs. We utilize an operations dashboard that aggregates 

3




real-time, restaurant-level information for many aspects of our business. The dashboard provides corporate and field management, as well as restaurant-level operators, with insight into how we are performing from the customer’s perspective. In addition, all company operated restaurants utilize digital “communication boards,” which communicate sales, cost and consumer data in real time to our restaurant managers.
Developing High Average Unit Volumes (“AUVs”) and Strong Unit Economics One Chicken at a Time. We seek to position ourselves as a differentiated LSR business, which we believe drives restaurant operating results that are competitive with other leading restaurant concepts in both the fast-casual and QSR industry segments. We believe that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, consistent restaurant-level financial results, and high returns on invested capital. In 2022, our company-operated restaurants generated average annual sales per restaurant of approximately $2.1 million and restaurant-level contribution margins of 13.2%.
Experienced Leadership. Most of our senior management team has extensive operating experience in the restaurant industry. Members of the senior leadership team include Larry Roberts as our Chief Executive Officer and President, Ira Fils as our Chief Financial Officer, Maria Hollandsworth as our Chief Operating Officer, Anne Jollay as our Chief Legal Officer, Rosanne Setoguchi as our Chief People Officer, Brian Carmichall as our Chief Development Officer and Andy Rebhun as our Chief Marketing Officer.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that we are well-positioned for sales growth because of our strong appeal to our core Hispanic family market, appeal to the broader general market, disciplined business model, and strong unit economics. Through 2019, our system experienced annual comparable restaurant sales growth for eight consecutive years. Our system comparable restaurant sales in fiscal 2020 declined 2.4%, which we believe was largely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 and 2021, our comparable restaurant sales grew 5.9% and 12.1%, respectively. We plan to continue to expand our business, drive restaurant sales growth and increase company profits by executing our Transformation Agenda, which consists of the following four key strategies:
Embed our Unique El Pollo Loco Culture. We believe that success in the restaurant industry is highly correlated with employee engagement, which is dependent upon hiring, retaining, developing and motivating employees. We invest in competitive pay and leadership training to ensure that our managers have the tools they need to be effective leaders and motivating coaches. We continue to build a culture centered around our mission, which is to “Feed the Love that Makes Us All Feel Like Family” and “Heart-Centered Leadership,” which is predicated on servant-led leadership, employee recognition and community involvement. We believe that executing on our mission will result in a better and more meaningful work experience for our employees. 
An important part of our culture is to provide greater support to the communities in which we operate. In 2004, we created El Pollo Loco Charities, a non-profit charity, to support the communities surrounding our restaurants. El Pollo Loco Charities, together with the Company, have provided over 15,000 meals per year to underprivileged families, through organizations like Food on Foot, Habitat for Humanity, Children’s Institute, and Court Appointed Special Advocates. For example, in 2019 we enhanced our community outreach through several initiatives, including (i) implementing a food donation program with Food Donation Connection and donating 75,000 tacos as part of our “Buy One, Feed Many” initiative, (ii) celebrating Caesar Chavez Day by recruiting 500 company employees, franchisees and customers to refresh a high school located in south Los Angeles and (iii) entering into a relationship with an Orange County-based organization to provide job opportunities for the homeless. In 2020, we provided funds to 13 Latina owned businesses that were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we launched a campaign called ValenKIND’s Day, which provided 10,000 meals to community members in our hometown of Los Angeles who are struggling with hunger and homelessness. For Mother’s Day, we issued $80,000 in grants to help moms in our communities and moms who are restaurant team members pursue their dreams in our “Strong Like A Madre” campaign. During 2022, we launched our first Round Up for Charity campaign benefiting Feeding America. El Pollo Loco Charities committed to match the first 100,000 customer round ups in our effort to reach our goal of raising $400,000 for the charity. In addition, in 2022, we donated 15,000 meals to Food on Foot’s Sunday Program, which serves people experiencing homelessness and food insecurity. Further, during the holidays in 2022, we participated in toy drives for various local charitable organizations including California Highway Patrol’s CHiPs for Kids. Lastly, we also continued a 2019 commitment to street artists in our communities by commissioning three new murals on the exterior walls of our restaurants in the Los Angeles area in celebration of Cesar Chavez Day, Mother’s Day, and Day of the Dead.

Build Awareness and Own our Lane. We believe that we are uniquely positioned within the LSR restaurant space. We will continue to adapt our menu to create family-sized dinner options and lunch entrees that complement our signature fire-grilled chicken, and are inspired by the culinary and cultural traditions of Mexico and our hometown of Los Angeles. We believe that we have opportunities for menu innovation as we look to increase customer frequency and target the dinner segment. In addition, we will continue to tap into the need for healthier offerings by building on the success of our fire-grilled chicken and “better for you” products. Our marketing and operations teams collaborate to ensure that the items developed in our test kitchen can be executed to our high standards in our restaurants with the convenience and value that our customers have come to expect.
We engage customers through our seasonal product calendar, which features new, unique limited time offers and variations of menu items like our Shredded Beef Birria, Overstuffed Fire-Grilled Chicken and Shredded Beef, and Avocado Quesadillas. Our key points of differentiation are communicated through our advertising campaign, which highlights the brand’s authenticity, “better for you” menu options and dedication to high-quality ingredients. We tailor our message from television and direct mail, which garners broad exposure, to our Loco Rewards loyalty program and social media platform where we engage in more personalized marketing.
We believe that investing in consumer-facing technology is critical to further differentiating our brand and reaching customers for whom convenience and value are key decision factors. Our Loco Rewards loyalty program offers rewards that incentivize customers to visit our restaurants more each month. As of December 28, 2022, there were 3.2 million members in the Loco Rewards loyalty program, whom we target with segmented, dynamic campaigns with special offers tailored to each customer segment with the goals of increasing visit frequency and growing overall spend.
In June 2018, we implemented delivery through DoorDash, a third-party delivery provider. In September 2019, we added Postmates and Uber Eats, and in February 2020 we added GrubHub, as additional marketplace delivery providers. For meals ordered through these market place platforms, restaurants incur a fee based on a percentage of the ticket. As of December 28, 2022, DoorDash maintained exclusivity for delivery orders placed directly with our restaurants. For orders placed directly from the restaurant, no fee is charged to the restaurant as the full delivery cost is borne by the customer. 
​
In total, during fiscal 2022, delivery orders constituted 7.8% of our total sales mix. As of December 28, 2022, all company-operated and franchise restaurants offered integrated delivery through a third-party service.
We plan to continue investing in our loyalty and delivery programs as well as other technology platforms to continue making it easier for customers to access our food.

Deliver Exceptional Service – Profitably. We believe that the key to building sustainable, consistent restaurant operations is through the development of restaurant leader bench, including area managers, general managers, assistant managers and shift leaders. To that end, we have put a renewed focus on leadership development, not only to benefit our current restaurant base, but also to ensure we have the leaders necessary for the continued growth of the El Pollo Loco brand. In addition to leadership development, at the team member level, we have completed the roll-out of an enhanced E-Learning platform across the system.
We also believe that simplifying our restaurant operations will further enhance our ability to attract and retain the best employees and further improve customer service. In 2022, we continued to implement initiatives to make it easier for our employees to operate our restaurants. These included eliminating a number of menu items as well as purchasing pre-chopped serrano peppers and fresh cilantro. Initiatives currently in test include soak tanks for cleaning grill hoods and broilers, and blenders to simplify salsa production. These and other initiatives are intended to enable our restaurant employees to increase their focus on customers and speed of service. We believe that this continued focus, combined with renewed emphasis on providing an exceptional customer experience, will lead to higher sales over the longer term.

Accelerate Development. We believe that execution of our first three strategies will enable us to grow our restaurant base. Our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results and high returns on invested capital. In 2020, we finalized a new restaurant design that we believe will clearly differentiate and communicate our brand, both on the exterior and interior. In addition, we redesigned the back-of-house to make it easier for employees to operate the restaurant. We believe that our remodels using this new design will result in higher restaurant revenue and a strengthened brand. During fiscal 2022, we completed six company-operated restaurants remodels using the new design. In 2022, our franchisees completed 16 remodels using the new design. In 2023, we plan to continue our standard practices for remodels, including 10-15 company-operated and 20-30 franchised restaurants.

5




We expect future new unit development to be led by franchisees, with company development being focused on existing markets. In order to expand into new markets, we believe that we need to source new franchisees and, therefore, we expect to invest more resources in sourcing and onboarding them in the future.
Site Selection and Expansion
Restaurant Development
We believe that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results, and high returns on invested capital, which we believe provide us with a strong foundation for unit growth over the long-term. In 2022, four new company-operated restaurants were opened, two in Nevada and two in California, and nine new franchised restaurants were opened, seven in California, one in Colorado, and one in Utah. 
In fiscal 2023, we intend to open four to six new company-operated and eight to twelve new franchised restaurants. There is no guarantee that we will be able to open new company-operated or franchised restaurants, or to increase the overall number of our restaurants. We may be unsuccessful in expanding within existing or into new markets for a variety of reasons as described below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including competition for customers, sites, franchisees, employees, licenses, and financing.
Site Selection Process
We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in its long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential restaurant locations. Our in-house development team has extensive experience building such brands as Taco Bell, The Habit Burger Grill, Carl’s Jr., Baskin Robbins, Wendy’s, Denny’s and Dunkin’ Brands. We use a combination of our in-house development team and outside real estate consultants to locate, evaluate, and negotiate new sites using various criteria, including demographic characteristics, daytime population thresholds, and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. The process for selecting locations incorporates management’s experience and expertise and includes extensive data collection and analysis. Additionally, we use information and intelligence gathered from managers and other restaurant personnel that live in or near the neighborhoods that we are considering.
Based on our experience and results, we are currently focused on developing freestanding sites with drive-thrus along with select in-line locations. Our restaurants perform well in a variety of neighborhoods, which gives us greater flexibility and lowers operating risk when selecting new restaurant locations.
We approve new restaurants only after formal review by our real estate site approval committee, which includes most of our senior management, and we monitor restaurants’ on-going performances to inform future site selection decisions.
Restaurant Construction
After identifying a lease site, we commence our restaurant build-out. Our new restaurants are either ground-up prototypes or retail space conversions. On average, it takes approximately 12 to 24 months from specific site identification to restaurant opening. Our restaurants are constructed in approximately 10 to 15 weeks. In order to maintain consistency of food and customer service, as well as our colorful, bright, and contemporary restaurant environment, we have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings.
Restaurant Management and Operations
Service
We are extremely focused on customer service. We aim to provide fast, friendly service on a solid foundation of dedicated, driven team members and managers. Our cashiers are trained on the menu items that we offer and offer customers thoughtful suggestions to enhance the ordering process. Our team members and managers are responsible for our service and dining room environment with a focus on hospitality. Team members seek to engage in conversation with our customers to ensure satisfaction. In addition, constant monitoring of the dining room occurs to ensure the beverage station is clean and supplied with products.

Operations
We utilize systems that are aimed at measuring our ability to deliver a “best in class” experience for our customers. These systems include customer surveys, social media ratings and speed-of-service performance trends. The operational results from all of these sources are then presented on an operations dashboard that displays the measures in an easy-to-read online format that corporate and restaurant-level management and franchisees can utilize in order to develop specific plans for continuous performance improvement. In addition, all company operated restaurants utilize digital “communication boards”, which communicate sales, costs and consumer data in real time to our restaurant managers.
We have food safety and quality assurance programs designed to maintain the highest standards for the food and the food preparation procedures that are used by both company-operated and franchised restaurants. We have a quality assurance team and employ third-party auditors that perform our work place and food safety restaurant audits.
Managers and Team Members
Each of our restaurants typically has a general manager and two to three shift leaders and some restaurants have an assistant manager. There are between 15 and 35 team members per restaurant who prepare our food fresh daily and provide customer service. To lead our restaurant management teams, we have area leaders, each of whom is responsible for 7 to 9 restaurants. Overseeing the area leaders are three Regional Directors of Operations who report up to our Chief Operating Officer. Franchise operations are supported by three directors of franchise and a Senior Vice President, Franchise, who reported to the Chief Development Officer during 2022 and starting in 2023 will report to the Chief Operating Officer. The restaurant development team is supported by four directors who also currently report to the Chief Development Officer.
Training
Our team members are the heart of El Pollo Loco, and it is our responsibility to equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to deliver our high standards and commitments to the customer and team member experience. We strive to find ways to simplify our methodology and invest in elevating our team members and leaders. In a rapidly evolving landscape, effective training depends not only on the quality of content but also on delivery methods. We believe in a blended approach to training to capture all audiences by integrating digital technology and traditional hands-on training activities. To engage our growing base of multi-generational employees, we employ a Learning Management System called Pollo Zone, a tablet-based interactive learning tool. This platform is a central hub for all training efforts and features individual learner profiles to support engagement and accountability on our path toward investing in our people and their growth.
Franchise Program
We use a franchising strategy to increase new restaurant growth in certain markets, leveraging the ownership of entrepreneurs with specific local market expertise and requiring a relatively minimal capital commitment by us. As of December 28, 2022, we had a total of 302 franchised restaurants. Franchisees range in size from single-restaurant operators to our largest franchisee, which owned 68 restaurants as of December 28, 2022. Our existing franchise base consists of many successful, longstanding, multi-unit restaurant operators. As of December 28, 2022, approximately 89% of franchised restaurants were owned and operated by franchisees that had been with us for over 20 years.
We believe that the franchise revenue generated from our franchise base has historically served as an important source of stable and recurring cash flows to us, and we accordingly plan to expand our base of franchised restaurants. In existing markets, we encourage growth from current franchisees. In our expansion markets, we seek highly-qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities.
We believe that creating a foundation of initial and on-going support is important for future success, both for our franchisees and for our brand. Therefore, we have structured our corporate staff, programs, and communication systems to ensure that we are delivering high-quality support to our franchisees.
Our franchise training program is a key element in ensuring our franchise owners and their managers are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary for success. The program introduces new franchise members to El Pollo Loco with hands-on training in the operation and management of our restaurants. This foundational training is conducted by a 

7




general training manager who has been certified by our operations group. Training must be successfully completed before a trainee can be assigned to a restaurant as a manager.
Once introductory training has been completed, we offer a path toward constant learning for all crew members by providing instructional materials that span management training, operations, new product introductions, food safety and a number of other essential restaurant functions. Many of these programs are distributed through Pollo Zone that provides our franchise owners with real-time access to the progress of learning in their restaurants.
Marketing and Advertising
We strive to distinguish the El Pollo Loco brand by building a brand equity that we believe not only accentuates our strengths but also deepens the strong emotional connections we have with our customers. We promote our restaurants and products by emphasizing our points of differentiation, which include our Mexican and LA heritages, our fresh ingredients and made-from-scratch preparation, and the cooking of our citrus-marinated chicken on open fire grills in our kitchens, as well as the convenience and quality we offer for families.
We use multiple marketing channels, including television, radio and digital. We advertise on local broadcast and cable television. Over the past year, we have significantly increased our percentage of media dedicated towards digital advertising.
Through our public relations efforts, we engage notable food editors, influencers and bloggers on a range of topics to help promote our products. In addition, we engage in one-on-one conversations using a portfolio of social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. We also use social media as a research and customer service tool, and apply insights gained to future marketing efforts.
Our Loco Rewards loyalty program uses points, rewards, and offers to build engagement with our customers. Customers access the program on elpolloloco.com and the El Pollo Loco iOS Apple and Android app. We build segmented dynamic campaigns with special offers tailored to each customer segment with the goals of increasing visit frequency and growing overall spend. To keep customers engaged with the program, unannounced offers, called “Surprise and Delights” are awarded based on that customer’s transaction history. We communicate offers, loyalty updates and other Loco Rewards campaigns to customers via in-app messaging, mobile phone push notifications and email. 
Our online ordering program makes it easy for customers to skip the line and order ahead. Available at every location and accessible from elpolloloco.com or the El Pollo Loco mobile app, any order can be placed and paid for before arriving at the restaurant. El Pollo Loco has partnered with DoorDash, UberEats and Grubhub as additional methods for ordering. El Pollo Loco also operates direct delivery via elpolloloco.com or the Loco Rewards App, which is exclusively fulfilled by DoorDash.
Purchasing and Distribution
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients, and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications, from reliable suppliers. We regularly inspect our vendors to ensure that products purchased conform to our standards and that prices offered are competitive. We have a quality assurance team and third-party accredited auditors that perform comprehensive supplier audits on a frequency schedule based on the potential food safety risk for each product. We contract with McLane Company (our “primary distributor”), a major foodservice distributor, for substantially all of our food and supplies, including the poultry that our restaurants receive from suppliers. Our primary distributor delivers supplies to most of our restaurants three times per week. Our restaurants in Texas, Louisiana and Colorado utilize regional distributors for produce. Our franchisees are required to use our primary distributor or an approved regional distributor, and franchisees must purchase food and supplies from approved suppliers. Poultry is our largest product cost item and represented approximately 38% of our total food and paper costs for 2022. Fluctuations in supply and in price can significantly impact our restaurant service and profit performance. We actively manage cost volatility for poultry by negotiating with multiple suppliers and entering into what we believe are the most favorable contract terms given existing market conditions. In the past, we have entered into contracts ranging from one to two years depending on current and expected market conditions. We currently source poultry from six suppliers, with two accounting for approximately 79% of our purchases for fiscal 2022. More than half of our poultry purchases have a fixed price through the end of 2023.

Intellectual Property

We have registered El Pollo Loco ® , Pollo Bowl ® , The Crazy Chicken ® , and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and El Pollo Loco ® in approximately 43 foreign countries and the European Union. In addition, the El Pollo Loco logo, website name and address, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube accounts are our intellectual property. Our policy is to pursue and maintain registration of service marks and trademarks in those countries where business strategy requires us to do so, and to oppose vigorously any infringement or dilution of the service marks or trademarks in those countries. We maintain the recipe for our chicken marinade, as well as certain proprietary standards, specifications, and operating procedures, as trade secrets or as confidential proprietary information.
Competition
We operate in the restaurant industry, which is highly competitive and fragmented. The number, size, and strength of competitors varies by region. Our competition includes a variety of locally-owned restaurants and national and regional chains that offer dine-in, carry-out, and delivery services.
We believe that competition within the fast-casual restaurant segment is based primarily on ambience, price, taste, quality, and freshness of menu items, as well as on the convenience of drive-thru service. We also believe that QSR competition is based primarily on quality, taste, speed of service, value, brand recognition, restaurant location, and customer service. In addition, we compete with franchisors of other restaurant concepts for prospective franchisees.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including regulation of discharges into the air and water, storage and disposal of liquid and solid waste, and clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater. Under various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, in, or emanating from that property. Such liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
Certain of our properties may be located on sites that we know or suspect have been used by prior owners or operators as retail gasoline stations. Such properties previously contained underground storage tanks (“USTs”) for gasoline storage, and while we are not aware of any sites with USTs remaining, it is possible that some of these properties may currently contain abandoned USTs. We are aware of contamination from a release of hazardous materials by a previous owner or operator at two of our owned properties and one of our leased properties. We do not believe that we have contributed to the pre-existing contamination at any of these properties. The appropriate state agencies have been notified, and these issues are being handled without disruption to our business. It is possible that petroleum products and other contaminants may have been released at other properties into the soil or groundwater. Under applicable federal and state environmental laws, we, as the current owner or operator of these sites, may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation for certain contamination. Although we lease most of our properties, and, when we own, we obtain certain assurances from the prior owner or often obtain indemnity agreements from third parties, we may nonetheless be liable for environmental conditions relating to our prior, current, or future restaurants or restaurant sites. If we were found liable for the cost of remediation of contamination at, or emanating from, any of our properties, our operating expenses would likely increase and our operating results would likely be adversely affected and, in extraordinary circumstances, our operating results could be materially affected.
Since 2000, we have obtained “Phase One” Environmental Site Assessments (assessing whether current or historical property uses have impacted soil or groundwater beneath the property, posing a threat to the environment and/or human health) for new restaurants. Where warranted, we obtain updated reports, and, if necessary, in rare cases, we obtain “Phase Two” Environmental Site Assessments (evaluating the presence or absence of petroleum products or hazardous substances via soil and/or groundwater sampling). We have not conducted a comprehensive subsurface environmental review of all of our properties or operations. No assurance can be given that we have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties or that such liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Regulation and Compliance
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern our business operations, including those governing:

​
We require each of our franchise partners to comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. We have processes in place to monitor our own compliance with the numerous, complex, applicable laws and regulations governing our operations.
We are subject to new, varied and ever-changing rules and regulations regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, which have materially impacted our earnings and resulted in significant capital expenditures. New federal, state and local government regulations regarding COVID-19 are issued and existing regulations are frequently revised, which materially affected, and continues to affect, our operations. Such regulations govern, for example, employee leave, opening and closing of restaurants and dining rooms, business hours, sanitation practices, guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices and personal protective equipment.
​
Other than as described above, the Company’s compliance with federal, state or local laws and regulations, including environmental laws, is not expected to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict what laws will be enacted in the future, or how existing or future laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced. We also cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims and lawsuits relating to, these various laws and regulations. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. Moreover, although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant problems in obtaining required licenses, permits, or approvals, any difficulties, delays, or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a restaurant in a particular area. Additionally, a significant portion of our hourly staff is paid at minimum wage rates consistent with the applicable federal, state, or local laws and, accordingly, increases in the applicable minimum wage will increase our labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, and which may require us to design or modify our restaurants to make reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals.

See Item 1A “Risk Factors” and “Environmental Matters” above in this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and regulation of our business. 
Management Information Systems
All of our company-operated and franchised restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems, which we believe can scale to support our long-term growth plans. Our point-of-sale system provides a touch-screen interface and is integrated with segmented Europay, Mastercard and Visa tokenized high speed credit and gift card processing hardware. Our point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which provides daily sales and product mix information that we actively analyze.
Our in-restaurant back-office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and to provide labor and food cost management tools. The system also provides corporate headquarters and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data, and reduces the time spent by restaurant managers on administrative needs. The system further provides sales, bank deposit, and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. For company-operated restaurants, we use this data to generate weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly profit and loss statements for each location, with final reports following the end of each period.

Human Capital

As of December 28, 2022, we had approximately 4,931 employees, of whom approximately 4,766 were hourly restaurant employees comprised of 3,883 crewmembers, 191 general managers/acting general managers, 108 assistant managers, 542 shift leaders, and 42 employees in limited-time roles as acting managers or as managers in training. The remaining 165 employees were corporate and office personnel. None of our employees are part of a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory.
We believe our efforts to maintain solid relationships with our employees are effective and are grounded in our company values. Our primary human capital objective is employee engagement, which is dependent upon hiring, retaining, developing and motivating employees. We strive to build a culture centered around our mission, which is to “Feed the Love that Makes Us All Feel Like Family” and “Heart-Centered Leadership.” We believe this mission is predicated on servant-led leadership, employee recognition and community involvement. We offer our employees both online and on-the-job training. Restaurant management trainees participate in comprehensive, multi-week training programs touching on all aspects of the operations, including restaurant leadership. We provide key restaurant leadership roles with a quarterly cash-based performance bonus awards. Our corporate employees are provided an annual performance bonus award. We also have an equity incentive compensation plan to provide certain management-level or other key employees with stock-based awards. We monitor our progress with metrics such as employee performance measures, turnover rates and restaurant customer surveys.  
The health and well-being of our employees and guests have always been and continues to be our top priority. We have maintained enhanced safety measures and continue to monitor cases of COVID-19 to help protect the health and well-being of all of our employees. In 2022, we also continued to provide extended sick leave benefits to employees impacted by COVID-19.
Seasonality
Seasonal factors, including weather and the timing of holidays, cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced January and December transactions and higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of seasonality, our quarterly and annual results of operations and key performance indicators such as company restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate.
