Item 1 Description of Business
Overview
 
Our company was formed on April 9, 2012 as Phalanx, Inc., under the laws of the State of Nevada and changed its name to ToughBuilt Industries, Inc. on December 29, 2015. We were formed to design, manufacture and distribute innovative tools and accessories to the building industry. We market and distribute various home improvement and construction product lines for both do it yourself (“DIY”) and professional markets under the TOUGHBUILT® brand name, within the global multibillion dollar per year tool market. All of our products are designed by our in-house design team. Since our initial launch of product sales six years ago, we have experienced significant annual sales growth from approximately $1,000,000 in 2013 to over $15,000,000 in 2018.
 
Since August 2013, pursuant to a Service Agreement, we have been collaborating with Belegal, a Chinese firm, whose team of experts has provided ToughBuilt with additional engineering, sourcing services and quality control support for our operations in China. Belegal assists us with supply-chain management (process and operations in China) for our operations in China, among other things, facilitating the transmission of our purchase orders to our suppliers in China, conducting “in-process” quality checking and inspection, and shipping end-products manufactured in China to their final destinations. In accordance with the agreement, we pay all of the monthly costs for payroll, overhead and other operation expenses associated with the Belegal’s activities on behalf of ToughBuilt.
 
Our business is currently based on development of innovative and state of the art products, primarily in tools and hardware category, with particular focus on building and construction industry with the ultimate goal of making life easier and more productive for the contractors and workers alike. Our current product line includes two major categories related to this field, with several additional categories in various stages of development, consisting of Soft Goods and Kneepads and Sawhorses and Work Products.

Products
 
We create innovative products that help our customers build faster, build stronger and work smarter. We accomplish this by listening to what our customers wants and need and researching how professionals work, then we create tools that help them save time, save hassle and save money.
 
TOUGHBUILT® manufactures and distributes an array of high quality and rugged tool belts, tool bags and other personal tool organizer products. We also manufacture and distribute a complete line of knee pads for various construction applications. Our line of job-site tools and material support products consists of a full line of miter-saw and table saw stands and saw horses/job site tables and roller stands. All of our products are designed and engineered in the United States and manufactured in China and India under our quality control supervision. We do not need government approval for any of our products.
 
Our soft sided tool storage line is designed for a wide range of do-it-yourself and professional needs. This line of pouches and tool and accessories bags is designed to organize your tools faster and easier. Interchangeable pouches clip on and off any belt, bag ladder wall or vehicle. Our products let you carry what you want so you have it when you want it.
 
ToughBuilt’s wide mouth tool carry-all bags come in sizes from 12 inches to 30 inches. They all have steel reinforced handles and padded shoulder straps which allow for massive loads to be carried with ease. Rigid plastic hard-body lining protects everything inside. Double mesh pockets included inside provide complete visibility for stored items. They include a lockable zipper for added security and safety and secondary side handles for when it takes more than one to carry the load.
 
All of these products have innovative designs with unique features that provide extra functionality and enhanced user experience. Patented features such as our exclusive “Cliptech” mechanism incorporated in some of the products in this line are unique in these products for the industry and have distinguished the line from other similarly situated products thus we believe, increasing appeal amongst the other products of this category in the professional community and among the enthusiasts.
 
Soft Goods
 
The flagship of the product line is the Soft Goods line that consists of over 100 variations of tool pouches, tool rigs, tool belts and accessories, tools bags, totes, variety of storage solutions, and office organizers/bags for laptop/tablet/cellphones, etc. Management believes that the breadth of the line is one of the deepest in the industry and has specialized designs to suit professionals from all sectors of the industry including plumbers, electricians, framers, builders and more.
 
We have a selection of over 10 models of kneepads, some with revolutionary and patented design features that allow the users to interchange components to suit particular conditions of use. Management believes that these kneepads are among the best performing kneepads in the industry. Our “all terrain” knee pad protection with snapshell technology is part of our interchangeable kneepad system which helps to customize the jobsite needs. They are made with superior quality using multilevel layered construction, heavy duty webbing and abrasion-resistant PVC rubber.
 
Sawhorses and Work Products
 
The second major category consists of Sawhorses and Work Support products with their unique designs and robust construction targeted for the most discerning users in the industry. The innovative designs and construction of the more than 15 products in this category have led to the sawhorses becoming the best sellers of category everywhere they are sold. The newest additions in this category include several stands and work support products that are quickly gaining recognition in the industry and are expected to position themselves in the top tier products in a short time. Our sawhorse line, miter saw, table saw & roller stands are built to very high standards. Our sawhorse/jobsite table is fast to set up, holds 2,400 pounds, has adjustable heights, is made of all metal construction and has a compact design. These lines of products are slowly becoming the standard in the construction industry.

All of our products are designed in house with unending innovation and the highest standards to achieve features and benefits for not only the professional construction worker but also for the do-it-yourself person.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our product strategy is to develop product lines in a number of categories rather than focus on a single line of goods. This approach allows for rapid growth, wider brand recognition, and may ultimately result in increased sales and profits within an accelerated time period. We believe that building brand awareness of our current ToughBuilt lines of products will expand our share of the pertinent markets. Our business strategy includes the following key elements:

● | A commitment to technological innovation achieved through consumer insight, creativity and speed to market; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A broad selection of products in both brand and private labels; 
● | Prompt response; 
● | Superior customer service; and 
● | Value pricing. 

 
We will continue to consider other market opportunities while focusing on our customers’ specific requirements to increase sales.
 
Market
 
According to “Statista & Statistic Brain” the annual revenue in the construction industry was $1.731 trillion for 2016. There was approximately $394.6 billion in home improvement sales in the U.S. in 2018 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/239759/predicted-sales-of-home-improvement-retailers-in-the-us/). The heavy and civil engineering industry is over $260 billion with tools and hardware alone totaling over $60 billion for that same time period. In 2016, there were approximately 729,000 construction companies in the United States employing more than 7.3 million employees. In addition to the construction market, our products are marketed to the “do it yourself” and home improvement market place. The home improvement industry has fared much better in the aftermath of the Great Recession then the housing market. The U.S. housing stock of more than 130 million homes requires regular investment merely to offset normal depreciation. And many households that might have traded up to more desirable homes during the downturn decided instead to make improvements to their current homes. Meanwhile, federal and state stimulus programs encouraged homeowners and rental property owners to invest in energy-efficient upgrades that they might otherwise have deferred. Finally, many rental property owners, responding to a surge in demand from households either facing foreclosure or nervous about buying amid the housing market uncertainty, reinvested in their units.
 
As a result, improvement and repair spending held up well compared to residential construction spending. According to “Home Improvement – Still Growing in 2019”, on www.hiri.org, “the HIRI/IHS Markit forecast expects 5.5% growth in the home improvement products market in 2019 after a strong 6.2% in 2018.”
 
Total home improvement products sales are expected to increase 5.5% in 2018 to $420 billion in total sales. The Professional Market is expected to increase 6.0% in 2019 over 2018 and the Consumer Market will see a sales increase of 5.3%.

We are actively expanding into markets in Mexico and Latin American Countries the Middle East, the UAE and South Africa.
 
We are currently in product line reviews and discussions with Lowe’s, Home Depot Canada, Do It Best, True Value and other major retailers both domestically and internationally. A product line review requires the supplier to submit a comprehensive proposal which includes product offerings, prices, competitive market studies and relevant industry trends and other information. Management anticipates, within the near term, adding to its customer base up to three major retailers, along with several distributors and private retailers within six sectors and among 56 targeted countries.
Innovation and Brand Strength
 
Management believes that the robust capabilities at ToughBuilt eclipse those of most competitors as not every distributor or factory has the ability to quickly identify industry and end user opportunities and execute quickly to deliver winning product lines consistently. Also, in our view, most distributors and factories do not have a recognizable and reputable brand or the proven ability to reach major retailers globally to position their products and brands. We believe that we are able to take a design from concept to market within a very short period of time.
Product and Services Diversification
 
TOUGHBUILT® is a singular brand with a driven team that is poised to scale into a highly recognized global entity. We aim to grow ToughBuilt with several significant subsidiaries in the next few years to become the hub/platform for professionals, DIY’s (Do It Yourselfers) and passionate builders everywhere. Management anticipates that future subsidiaries will focus on licensing, gear, mobile, equipment rentals and maintenance services.

Mobile Device Products
 
Since 2013, we have been planning, designing, engineering and sourcing the development of a new line of ToughBuilt mobile devices and accessories to be used in the construction industry and by building enthusiasts. We are planning to have our mobile device products ready to market by mid to late 2019, at which time we intend to commence marketing and selling our mobile device products to our current global customer base. We believe that increasing numbers of companies in the construction industry are requiring their employees to utilize mobile devices not just to communicate with others but to utilize the special apps that will allow the construction workers to do their job better and more efficiently. All of our mobile devices are designed and built in accordance with IP-68 and military standards level of durability and with the cooperation of Foxconn Manufacturing.
 
Our ruggedized mobile line of products was created to place customized technology and wide varieties of data in the palm of the building professionals and enthusiasts such as contractors, subcontractors, foreman, general laborers etc. The devices, accessories and custom apps allow the users to plan with confidence, organize faster, find labor and products faster, estimate accurately, purchase wisely, protect themselves, workers and their business, create and track invoicing faster and easier.
 
By the fourth quarter of 2019, we intend to launch our T.55 rugged mobile phones and earbud headphones, as well as a “T-Dock”, attachable battery, tri lens camera and tough shield cover and accessories. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we also intend to launch the following accessories: car charger, QI charger, car mounts and earbud pack, and we will look at sales in the following industries: construction, industrial, military and law enforcement and “.coms”.

Agreement with Foxconn
 
On October 18, 2016, we entered into a Project Statement of Work Agreement (“SOW”) with Hon Hai Precision Ind. Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the law of Taiwan (referred to as “Foxconn”) to design, manufacture and supply to us a certain rugged mobile telephone (the “Product”). The Company will pay to Foxconn all fees and costs required to develop the Product. The Product will be developed by Foxconn to our specifications. We will submit to Foxconn written specifications, features and concepts required to be included in the Product. The specifications are subject to review and update by the parties and upon written approval by the parties such new or revised specifications will become part of the SOW. The SOW also provides dates for completion of deliverables, such as prototypes, “Beta” testing of the Product, sample assembly of the prototype and commencement of mass production of the Product. We may terminate the SOW at any time, in which case we must pay the costs for those portions of the development work completed by Foxconn up to the date of termination. The SOW is governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
Mobile Device Market
 
Based upon an annual white paper published by the Mobile and Wireless Practice of Venture Development Corporation, we believe that an increasing number of companies are requiring their employees to transact business in the field and/or other non-traditional office environments. Because of this and other factors, the construction industry is accelerating its acceptance of wireless technology. We further believe that the construction industry, like other industries, will be leveraging mobile and wireless solutions to address the need for greater collaboration among a highly mobile and distributed workforce.
 
We believe that mobility is one of the top technology trends that construction companies are focusing on in 2018 and beyond. Mobile technology continues to have a significant impact on business, specifically with regard to business communication as this technology enhances the ability for colleagues at different locations to easily communicate, enhances customer experience through the improvement of applications and websites available to consumers to do business through their devices “at their fingertips”, and optimizes business operations as there is instant access to business functions at any time and from any location. (“Impact of Mobile Technology in Business Communication”, by John Smith, dated November 19, 2016 (https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/impact-mobile-technology-business-communication-01704702).
 
While the construction industry has widely adopted solutions such as push to talk (PTT) telephony applications, the use of mobile and wireless data applications has been limited. IT solutions in general and mobile and wireless solutions specifically have been adopted at varying degrees within organizations and to support the various phases of construction projects. Currently the business planning, engineering and procurement operations have more effectively deployed IT solutions while actual construction operations have fallen behind in IT infrastructure and field automation solutions. The construction and engineering workforce is inherently mobile. However, construction sites have never effectively leveraged (wireless) communications networks to connect these distributed and often remote workers and their assets. Nevertheless, construction project managers require real time access to a variety of information, including real time tool inventory management, raw materials deliveries, job costing, time stamping and general project management information. The challenge, however, is the lack of network access on construction sites resulting in an information bottleneck on the job site. Buoyed by advances in wireless technologies – including coverage, performance, security and cost of ownership – we believe this is becoming an issue of the past for construction operations.

Mobile Apps
 
We intend to include apps on our mobile devices and are developing, with a third party applications developer, apps which will include, among other things, building codes, permitting, estimating and job listings. The purposes of the apps that are being developed include:

● | To reduce construction delays. Gathering real-time information at the job site about issues such as trades and contractors present at the site, construction progress, or incidents, can reduce overall project delays. This critical information helps to bring issues to light that might put projects on hold, and keep construction on schedule. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To improve communication with owners and project stakeholders. Completing daily reports at the job site on mobile devices and sending automated emails can tighten the communication loop with project stakeholders. When all parties involved in the project have access to the same information at the same time, errors are reduced and issues requiring attention can be addressed faster. 
● | To increase back-office efficiency. By eliminating the use of paper and spreadsheets, construction companies can save hundreds of hours spent on data entry, collating information for reporting, or looking for paperwork that has been lost or filed away. Increasing back-office efficiency allows projects to be run leaner and to be completed on time and on budget. 
● | To improve accountability of field staff. Staff travel times, GPS locations and time spent on-site can all be consistently monitored with mobile apps. This improves accountability and reduces labor costs. Costs can be also reduced with mobile timesheets that record clock-in/clock-out time to the minute. 
● | To improve accuracy of project documentation. Using mobile apps to capture information at the job site improves accuracy and reduces issues that arise from illegible handwriting, inconsistent data, and information gaps. Photos, GPS, time stamps and signatures captured on-site provide an accurate and indisputable audit trail for the project, delivering accountability to clients or evidence in legal disputes. 
● | To improve equipment management. Construction companies that use a database-driven mobile solution can maximize the use of equipment through better management and tracking. Real-time information about maintenance schedules, availability, and equipment locations helps to improve inventory planning and use. 
● | To utilize real-time mobile access to plans and bylaws. With apps that provide two-way access to information, construction companies can file electronic versions of drawings, plans or bylaws for quick offline access by teams in the field. This improves productivity and reduces the need for re-work. 

Sales Strategy
 
The devices, accessories and bolt on digital tools will be sold through relevant home improvement big box stores, direct marketing to thousands of construction companies, direct marketing to thousands of trade/ wholesale outlets and to professional outlets.
Intellectual Property
 
We hold several patents and trademarks of various durations and believe that we hold, have applied for or license all of the patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We utilize trademarks (licensed and owned) on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and our Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our ToughBuilt®, Cliptech®, and Fearless® trademarks to be among our most valuable intangible assets. Trademarks registered both in and outside the U.S. are generally valid for ten years, depending on the jurisdiction, and are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on appropriate application

In the first quarter of 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted two new design patents (US D840,961 S and US D841,635 S) that cover ToughBuilt’s ruggedized mobile devices, which are valid for a period of 15 years.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information relating to our design and processes for our products. We have entered into and will continue to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and proprietary rights assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors. We have entered into and will continue to enter into confidentiality agreements with our suppliers to protect our intellectual property.
 
Competition
 
The tool equipment and accessories industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete with a significant number of other tool equipment and accessories manufacturers and suppliers to the construction, home improvement and Do-It-Yourself industry, many of which have the following:

● | Significantly greater financial resources than we have; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | More comprehensive product lines; 
● | Longer-standing relationships with suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers; 
● | Broader distribution capabilities; 
● | Stronger brand recognition and loyalty; and 
● | The ability to invest substantially more in product advertising and sales. 

 
Our competitors’ greater capabilities in the above areas enable them to better differentiate their products from ours, gain stronger brand loyalty, withstand periodic downturns in the construction and home improvement equipment and product industries, compete effectively on the basis of price and production, and more quickly develop new products. These competitors include DeWalt, Caterpillar and Samsung Active.
