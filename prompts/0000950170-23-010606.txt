History of the Company
The Company was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “OBCA”) on August 13, 2018 under the name “Canaccord Genuity Growth Corp.” as a special purpose acquisition corporation for the purpose of effecting an acquisition of one or more businesses or assets, by way of a merger, amalgamation, arrangement, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or any other similar business combination.
On October 17, 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a letter of intent with Columbia Care LLC (“Old Columbia Care”) to exclusively negotiate a business combination between the two companies. On November 21, 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with Old Columbia Care pursuant to which, among other things, the Company would acquire all of the membership interests of Old Columbia Care by way of a merger between Old Columbia Care and a newly-formed Delaware subsidiary of the Company (the “Business Combination”). The Business Combination constituted the Company’s qualifying transaction.
The Business Combination was completed on April 26, 2019, at which point Old Columbia Care became a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company was continued out of the jurisdiction of Ontario under the OBCA and into the jurisdiction of British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (“BCBCA”).
Arrangement Agreement
On March 23, 2022, the Company entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Cresco Labs Inc. (“Cresco”), pursuant to which, Cresco has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding Common Shares and proportionate voting shares (“Proportionate Shares” and together with the Common Shares, the “Columbia Care Shares”) of Columbia Care, pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the BCBCA (the “Arrangement”).
Consideration
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and Plan of Arrangement, holders of Columbia Care Shares will receive 0.5579 of a subordinate voting share of Cresco (each a “Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Share”), subject to adjustment as described below (the “Exchange Ratio”), for each Columbia Care Share (on an as converted to Common Share basis) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement (the “Effective Time”), with the Proportionate Shares treated on an as if converted basis to Common Shares pursuant to their respective terms; provided, the Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustment in the event that Columbia Care is required to issue shares in satisfaction of an earn-out payment for a prior acquisition, with the potential adjustment in proportion to the additional dilution from such potential issuance relative to Columbia Care’s current fully diluted in-the-money outstanding shares. The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

At the Effective Time, (i) all Columbia Care equity awards granted under Columbia Care’s equity incentive plan or otherwise that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for replacement equity awards such that, upon exercise (with respect to options) or vesting (with respect to performance share units or restricted share units), as applicable, the holder will be entitled to receive Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares, with the number of shares underlying such award and, in the case of options, the exercise price of such award adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio; (ii) each of the warrants to acquire Common Shares issued by Columbia Care that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exercisable, in accordance with the terms of such warrants, for the number of Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares that the holder of such warrants would have been entitled to receive as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement if, immediately prior to the date upon which the Arrangement becomes effective pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement (the “Effective Date”), such holder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had exercised such holder’s warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) each of the convertible notes issued by Columbia Care that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be convertible, in accordance with the terms of such convertible notes, into the number of Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares that the holder of such convertible notes would have been entitled to receive as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement if, immediately prior to the Effective Date, such holder had been the registered holder

of the number of Common Shares to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had converted such holder’s convertible notes immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Conditions to the Arrangement
The Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval by Columbia Care shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast on the Arrangement resolution by Columbia Care shareholders voting as a single class present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting, and if required by applicable law, approval by Columbia Care shareholders holding a simple majority of the votes attached to Columbia Care Shares voting as a single class present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting, excluding the votes of those persons whose votes are required to be excluded under Multilateral Instrument 61-101—Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions. The aforementioned approvals were obtained at a Special Meeting of the Company’s shareholders on July 8, 2022. It is a condition to closing in favor of Cresco that holders of less than 5% of the outstanding Columbia Care Shares shall have validly exercised dissent rights with respect to the Arrangement that have not been withdrawn as of the effective date of the Arrangement.
In addition, the Arrangement is subject to approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (or any other court with appropriate jurisdiction) at a hearing upon the procedural and substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the Arrangement, which approval was granted through a final order issued on July 15, 2022, and certain regulatory approvals, including but not limited to the approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The Arrangement is also conditioned upon neither a delisting from the Canadian Securities Exchange having occurred nor a cease trade order having been issued by any governmental entity in respect of the Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares since the date of this Agreement and that remains in effect. The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of Columbia Care and Cresco and by either party in certain circumstances as more particularly set forth in the Arrangement Agreement.
Certain Other Terms of the Arrangement Agreement
The Arrangement Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Cresco and Columbia Care and each party has agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the conduct of its business during the interim period between execution of the Arrangement Agreement and the Effective Time.
 The Arrangement Agreement provides for customary non-solicitation covenants, subject to the right of the board of directors of Columbia Care (the “Board”) to consider and accept a superior proposal (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement), and the right of Cresco to match any such proposal within five business days. The Arrangement Agreement also provides for the payment by Columbia Care to Cresco of a $65.0 million termination fee if the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain specified circumstances, including, among other things, in the event of (i) a Change in Recommendation, whereby the Board’s recommendations or determinations with respect to the Arrangement are modified in a manner adverse to Cresco; (ii) Columbia Care, in accordance with certain procedures set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal; or (iii) the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including in the event the resolution approving the Arrangement is not approved by Company Shareholders, the Arrangement is not consummated on or prior to March 31, 2023 (subject to modification by the parties and extension in certain circumstances, which date the parties have mutually agreed to extend to June 30, 2023), or in the event Columbia Care breaches any representation or warranty or fails to perform any covenant or agreement that causes the closing conditions related to Columbia Care’s representations and warranties and covenants not to be satisfied, and such breach or failure is incapable of being cured on or prior to March 31, 2023 (now June 30, 2023) or is not cured and Cresco is not then in breach of the Arrangement Agreement so as to directly or indirectly cause any closing condition related to Cresco’s representations and warranties and covenants not to be satisfied, and if (x) prior to the date of termination an acquisition proposal meeting certain requirements has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to Columbia Care, and (y) within 12 months of the date of such termination the acquisition proposal transaction is completed or Columbia Care has entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such transaction and such transaction is later consummated or effected (whether or not within such 12 month period).
 On February 27, 2023, Cresco and Columbia Care announced that they had mutually agreed to extend the Arrangement Agreement to complete the acquisition by a further 90 days to June 30, 2023. This extension is intended to give the parties additional time to complete the divestitures required for Regulatory purposes.
 Voting Support Agreements and Lock-up Agreements
Pursuant to certain voting support agreements (the “Voting Support Agreements”), certain Columbia Care shareholders holding an aggregate of more than 20% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding Columbia Care Shares as of March 23, 2022 have entered into Voting Support Agreements with Cresco, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote in favor of the Arrangement at the Meeting. The Voting Support Agreements terminate in certain circumstances, including upon the termination of the Arrangement

Agreement in accordance with its terms. Under the Arrangement Agreement, Columbia Care has agreed to hold the Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, on or before June 15, 2022 (or such later date as may be agreed to by Columbia Care and Cresco in writing, which the parties agreed to be July 8, 2022). In addition, pursuant to certain lock-up agreements (the “Lock-up Agreements”), certain Columbia Care shareholders holding an aggregate of more than 20% of issued and outstanding Columbia Care Shares (on an as converted to Common Share basis) as of March 23, 2022 agreed to restrict the sale or other transfer of 90% of the Cresco Labs Subordinate Voting Shares to be received by such Company Care shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement.

 Development of Columbia Care’s Other Business Elements
2020
March 2020 Private Placement of Units
In March 2020, the Company completed the first tranche of a non-brokered private placement (the “March 2020 Private Placement”) of units (the “March 2020 Private Placement Units”) for gross proceeds of US$14,250,000. Each March 2020 Private Placement Unit was comprised of: (i) US$1,000 principal amount of 9.875% senior secured first-lien notes (the “March 2020 Private Placement Notes”); and (ii) 113 common share purchase warrants (the “March 2020 Private Placement Warrants”) of the Company. On April 23, 2020, the Company completed the second and final tranche of the March 2020 Private Placement for additional gross proceeds of US$1,000,000. In total, the gross proceeds under the March 2020 Private Placement totaled US$15,250,000.
The March 2020 Private Placement Notes were governed by the terms of a trust indenture dated March 31, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as trustee. The March 2020 Private Placement Warrants are governed by the terms of a

warrant indenture (the “March 2020 Warrant Indenture”) dated March 31, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as warrant agent.
Launch of Virtual.Care Platform
In April 2020, the Company announced the launch of Virtual.Care (the “Platform”), an online educational and informational tool for patients, designated caregivers, and adult use purchasers, in those states where adult use cannabis is legalized. The Platform is accessed via the Company’s age-gated website and was initially launched in three states: California, Illinois and Massachusetts and has now expanded to five additional jurisdictions: Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C.
Prior to launching the Platform, the Company’s compliance team and external counsel undertook a review of the applicable federal and state privacy, advertising and cannabis laws and launched the Platform in a manner to comply with those laws. The Company’s Platform is not intended to be used in advertising activities but is intended to be used solely as a virtual educational tool, allowing users to understand the products that the Company offers. There are no sales of products completed over the Platform.
A user may pre-order products but to complete an order, the user must physically visit the applicable Columbia Care dispensary. This requirement furthers compliance since no orders will be completed for residents of jurisdictions where medical and/or recreational cannabis is illegal, as applicable.

In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the user, the dispensary staff person will verify the user’s medical marijuana card, government-issued identification and confirm the user’s allotment to ensure the user is not exceeding the state’s allotment limits. Once all of the foregoing is verified, the user will pay for the product to complete the purchase. The Platform does not allow medical users to obtain online certifications and any such certifications must be obtained through the normal channels.
In jurisdictions where recreational use is legal, upon arrival at the Columbia Care dispensary, the dispensary staff will verify that the user is at least 21 years of age by verifying the user’s government-issued identification. Once the identification is verified, the user will pay for the product to complete the transaction. If the user does not have valid identification, the user will not be able to purchase cannabis at the Company’s dispensaries. This process also allows monitoring of sales to non-residents and only allow sales where the state regulatory schemes allow an out-of-state resident to purchase product if he or she is present in the legal jurisdiction.
May 2020 Private Placement
In May 2020, the Company completed a concurrent brokered and non-brokered private placement (the “May 2020 Private Placement”) of units (the “May 2020 Private Placement Units”) for gross proceeds of US$19,115,000.

The May 2020 Private Placement Notes are governed by the terms of a trust indenture (the “May 2020 Trust Indenture”) dated May 14, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as trustee. The May 2020 Private Placement Warrants are governed by the terms of a warrant indenture (the “May 2020 Warrant Indenture”) dated May 14, 2020, between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as warrant agent.

In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company received binding commitments to exchange approximately $31,750,000 of the Company’s existing 13% senior secured notes due 2023, pursuant to private agreements in accordance with the trust indenture, for an equivalent amount of 2026 Notes plus accrued but unpaid interest and any negotiated premium thereon. As a result of the note exchanges, the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of $153,250,000 in cash pursuant to the offering of the 2026 Notes.

VentureForth Acquisition and Settlement
 On April 18, 2022, in connection with the acquisition and settlement of preexisting relationships, the Company issued 18,755,802 common shares (the “VentureForth Shares”) and, on April 18, 2022 and April 24, 2022 paid approximately $26,000,000 to acquire, by merger, VentureForth Holdings, LLC, which is the owner of VentureForth, LLC (“VentureForth”). VentureForth holds two licenses from the Washington D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration (“ABRA”), specifically, one license to cultivate and manufacture medical cannabis and one license to dispense medical cannabis. The Company previously had a management services agreement with VentureForth. The shares issued and amounts paid also amicably resolved, with no admissions of liability and in exchange for releases, certain direct, indirect, derivative and indemnification claims relating to a confidential arbitration to which VentureForth, a separate subsidiary of the Company and certain members of the Company’s management team were respondent parties.

Figure 1: Columbia Care Footprint


Columbia Care actively operates or has under development, cultivation and/or production assets in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Columbia Care’s existing U.S. license portfolio allows for (i) an aggregate of approximately 2,278,710 square feet of indoor cultivation and production footprint (including operational, in development and optioned space) within its currently leased or owned facilities (including options to expand within such facilities), with the potential to produce more than 150,000 kg of dry flower on an annual basis and (ii) an aggregate of approximately 143.8 acres of outdoor cultivation and production footprint (including operational and optioned space). This capacity does not include the potential yield from Columbia Care’s outdoor marijuana and industrial hemp acreage, which will vary seasonally. Since Columbia Care currently has operating facilities and projects under development across multiple jurisdictions in the United States, Columbia Care is not substantially dependent on any individual cultivation facility or dispensary.The table below describes each jurisdiction’s indoor and greenhouse cultivation and/or production operations as of December 31, 2022:

Columbia Care’s refined cultivation practices have experienced several iterations since its inception. Its cultivation expertise reflects years of operating experience and specialized input from agricultural, manufacturing, scientific and security experts. The Company has implemented the best practices employed at its nationwide locations in each new facility that it develops and expects to continue to improve and optimize its methods and infrastructure to ensure competitiveness and excellence.
Columbia Care’s production platform is designed to cultivate and manufacture cannabinoid-based products that are used specifically for medical use or consumer wellness, and health and lifestyle products produced to assure consistency and quality. Columbia Care engages national engineering consultants to design bespoke systems that follow industry best practices in order to produce its products. Columbia Care does all of this to optimize product quality, minimize the risk of exposing patients and consumers to potentially harmful contaminants while maximizing the effectiveness and consistency of the approved products delivered.
Columbia Care believes that a clean and sanitized growing and processing environment is key to ensuring the integrity of products. These self-imposed disciplines are more resource intensive, but are designed to yield a safe, consistent, contaminant-free product that will lead the market in quality, safety and, where applicable, efficacy.
Columbia Care’s growing process is designed to maximize quality, consistency and yield, while limiting contamination by fungal and bacterial diseases, insect and vertebrate pests, non-organic pesticides and other harmful contaminants. Each step in Columbia Care’s cultivation process, including (i) germination/propagation; (ii) vegetation; (iii) bloom; and (iv) harvest is carefully executed using refined standard operating procedures and training protocols. Columbia Care has standardized nutrient protocols, growing environments, water and irrigation strategies, growing mediums, climate controls, plant tracking, and staffing programs among other components of its cultivation and manufacturing operations. Its ultimate goal is to maximize the biomass output (grams per square foot) across all Columbia Care-operated facilities at the lowest cost possible without sacrificing product quality.
Extraction
Columbia Care utilizes a number of well-established, regulatory-approved methods for cannabinoid extraction and performs extraction of the leaves, trimmings and flowers of female cannabis plants to produce an approved cannabinoid product form. Once extracted, Columbia Care’s expert formulation staff formulates proprietary extracts into easily administered consumer products and medications for patient and consumer delivery by following protocol and state regulations.
Dispensaries
Columbia Care has, manages or is developing dispensaries in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia. All of Columbia Care’s dispensaries have either licensed pharmacists or trained personnel on staff to ensure that customers and patients have access to knowledgeable personnel that can advise on the responsible use of cannabis including delivery formats and dosing schedules. The table below describes each jurisdiction’s dispensary operations as of December 31, 2022.

Performance Indicators
As Columbia Care seeks to manage its development, management currently uses key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to assess its rate of growth and performance. These KPIs, which are subject to change, include top-line revenue, growth in gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP measure). These KPIs are further discussed under “Non-GAAP Measures” in Item 2.
Branding and Marketing
Columbia Care employs a diverse and knowledgeable staff of pharmacists and trained personnel for its dispensaries that reflect and embody its brand. Columbia Care has built its reputation on providing trusted, high-quality medical cannabis products to improve patients’ wellness journeys, which are also now available for adult-use consumption. The Company believes that Columbia Care has become known in the jurisdictions in which it operates as a trusted mark for health and wellness cannabis by constantly innovating to provide the best solutions for its patients and customers.
 In 2021, Columbia Care launched its Cannabist retail ecosystem. The Cannabist retail experience is centered on making shopping for cannabis as simple and approachable as possible, accommodating the vast range of experience levels among patients and customers. Merchandising set-ups and store layouts are organized to help customers move through the space with intent and become more comfortable in the process. Additionally, retail spaces are designed to encourage employees and customers to engage in conversations that enhance the shopping experience, whether through product recommendations or general education. To fully realize this goal, Cannabist staff undergo extensive training. Beyond the in-store experience, technology serves as a bridge across the retail ecosystem that enables a seamless shopping experience. Cannabist locations will continue to leverage existing solutions, such as Virtual.Care, the personal shopping platform, and a proprietary web-based application called Forage to help customers on their product discovery journey. Several dispensary locations in Utah, Arizona, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Florida and New York were transformed into Cannabist locations during 2021 and 2022. A number of new store openings in Virginia and West Virginia since 2021 are also Cannabist locations.
 Cannabis-based Product Selection and Offerings
Columbia Care has continually been at the forefront of developing and introducing innovative and safe products to serve patients’ and customers' unique needs. Columbia Care offers a competitive product portfolio in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Depending on the jurisdiction, Columbia Care offers a variety of products, including, without limitation, flower, concentrates, edibles and/or

accessories. As shown below, the product mix varies between jurisdictions. As such, Columbia Care benefits from its diverse and expanding product portfolio.
The Company’s products have similar characteristics due to the same raw material ingredient (cannabis), similar nature of cultivation process, the type or class of customer and the regulatory nature of our industry. Revenues from transactions with no single external customer exceed 10% of the consolidated revenues. Revenue earned outside of the United States of America is immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States of America are immaterial as at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.
Columbia Care has begun to bring its family of branded products to all jurisdictions where it has manufacturing operations. Columbia Care’s focus is to develop proprietary formulations and delivery technologies that provide patients and adult-use customers with high quality and differentiated products.

In 2016, Columbia Care announced the launch of its line of controlled-dose, solid-fill medicinal cannabinoid capsules. Formulated using the full range of active cannabinoid ingredients from plants grown in its cultivation facilities, these proprietary capsules offer a variety of concentrations in a more accessible and convenient delivery form to patients and customers.
Columbia Care introduced proprietary, controlled-dose, hard-pressed tablets in New York State. The tablets are manufactured by segregating and formulating precise combinations of active compounds derived from targeted strains of cannabis plants. From the formulation of these tablets, Columbia Care introduced additional products to provide a spectrum of cannabinoid profiles to address the continuum of patient and consumer needs. This precisely engineered diversity of optimized cannabinoids includes the Company’s patent pending Ceed line of medicinal cannabis products, including TheraCeed tablets, EleCeed sublingual tinctures and ClaraCeed vaporization oil.
In 2020, the Company launched Seed & Strain, its first lifestyle cannabis brand. Available in a number of markets, products include flower, pre-rolls and concentrates. Other product and branded categories include but are not limited to confections, chocolate, drink mixes, condiments, kief, shatter, and wax/crumble. Columbia Care launched Classix in five markets simultaneously in October 2021, and has since brought the brand to additional markets. Triple Seven has also been expanded from California to other operational markets.
Columbia Care intends to continue launching national brands across its medical and adult-use markets in order to maintain the consistency and quality of products that all patients and customers have come to expect from the Company.
None of Columbia Care’s products have been shown to effectively treat or cure any disease. None of Columbia Care’s products require approval by the FDA, and none of Columbia Care’s products have been approved, reviewed or cleared by the FDA for any purpose.
Product Pricing
Columbia Care’s prices vary based on market conditions and product pricing from non-cannabis suppliers. As a result of different tastes, preferences and customer demographics across its core markets, average dispensary sales differ significantly from state to state.
Caring for The Community We Serve
Having completed over 10 million sales transactions in multiple medicinal and adult-use cannabis markets since its inception, Columbia Care’s team has accumulated significant experience in the treatment of large consumer and specialized patient populations, addressing a wide range of unique combination of qualifying conditions, symptoms and risks. Columbia Care has dedicated funding for research collaborations and initiatives with leading academic medical centers across the country to enhance patient care, inform the policy debate and empower healthcare and wellness professionals with data on best practices and safe and efficacious cannabinoid use. Through its public policy efforts, Columbia Care is also at the forefront of ensuring that social equity is a large part of legalization efforts across the United States.
Columbia Care has launched extensive patient care initiatives including utilizing anonymized patient data to facilitate product optimization and innovation on behalf of patient and consumer needs. Columbia Care’s proprietary database is an important aspect of Columbia Care’s product development as it invests in branded formulations and administration types that best respond to patient and consumer needs.

Columbia Care has distinguished itself by establishing research collaborations with renowned medical and research institutions globally. The collaborations are designed to improve product efficacy and assess the medical utility in its products while enhancing

patient safety. Columbia Care has developed innovative and collaborative working relationships with a number of leading academic, patient advocacy, research and healthcare organizations as well as partnerships with private, academic, agricultural, policy, sustainability and economic programs at various institutions in the pursuit of expanding the body of scientific knowledge related to cannabis. This focus is one of the principal foundations of Columbia Care’s corporate culture and has materially contributed to Columbia Care’s position as one of the most qualified and experienced operators in certain regulated markets in the U.S. Some of the collaboration partners include but are not limited to researchers affiliated with the following institutions: Mount Sinai Hospital, Columbia University, Arizona State University, Brandeis University, The Center for Discovery in New York, The Dana Farber Cancer Institute, New York University, Albert Einstein/Montefiore Medical Center, Stanford University and King’s College London.
Banking and Processing
Columbia Care deposits funds from its dispensary operations into bank accounts established with various banking partners. The Company ensures that the banks used are fully aware of the nature of the business and industry in which the Company operates. Columbia Care currently accepts cash, cashless ATMs, and in certain locations the CNC card. The CNC card is the first store credit card in the cannabis industry, providing Columbia Care customers an alternative payment method in participating markets, increasing access to the Company’s products. Payment methods currently vary by market. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Columbia Care earned retail revenues of approximately $4.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively, from the CNC program. Columbia Care does not consider the CNC program to be a material revenue stream.
Real Estate Strategy
In each market that Columbia Care enters, it spends a significant amount of time and resources selecting real estate in highly desirable locations with convenient access to customers, healthcare communities and health and wellness providers and public transit, close proximity to major interstates and other traffic routes, ample parking, and the potential for significant foot traffic. Columbia Care typically targets retail spaces with a footprint of 2,500 to 7,500 square feet and cultivation/manufacturing facilities with a footprint of 20,000 to 65,000+ square feet, depending on the market and available real estate inventory. Columbia Care’s practice is to secure leases with a base term of five to ten years with extension options for renewal terms of five years.
In-Store Pickup and Delivery
Columbia Care is currently associated with certain third-party platforms that offer pre-ordering for in-store pickup, online payment processing and home delivery services, where allowed by law. Where required, patients are offered educational material and/or consultations regarding route of administration and dosing format.
Inventory Management
In the jurisdictions where Columbia Care is operational, it has comprehensive inventory management practices that are compliant with applicable state laws and regulations. Such practices ensure control over Columbia Care’s cannabis and cannabis product inventory using seed to sale tracking software. See “Columbia Care Compliance Program – Inventory and Security Policies”. Columbia Care’s practices are designed to avoid contamination and to ensure the safety and quality of the products dispensed.
Information Technology
Columbia Care strategically invests in information technology infrastructure. In fiscal year 2022, Columbia Care has initiated an effort to consolidate its operational systems, to provide national governance over business process and intelligence across merchandise planning, inventory management, production, costing, order management, accounting, reporting and analysis. These systems will provide the flexibility to support global and multi-channel expansion. Columbia Care has invested in information technology security platforms which are designed to protect patient and customer records and personal information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Research and Development
Columbia Care has been tracking consented patient outcomes since 2013, and now has a research database of more than 20 million sales transactions across all sales locations. It is working with experts to analyze this anonymized data to devise new genetics and new products tailored to individual patient conditions and wellness states.

Columbia Care has operated a product development and process development center in its Rochester, New York cultivation and manufacturing location since 2014, and now also conducts these activities in San Diego, California and Denver, Colorado. At these facilities, unit-dose formulations of proprietary cannabinoid combinations are created, and methods of extraction and separation are scaled. Additional work to add automation to these efforts and commercial manufacturing is ongoing.
Employees As of December 31, 2022, Columbia Care had 2,505 employees across its operating jurisdictions, versus 2,586 employees as of December 31, 2021. As of March 23, 2023, Columbia Care had approximately 2,278 employees.
Columbia Care is committed to:
•Hiring, training and retaining an efficient, hard-working and qualified labor force that reflects the racial, cultural and ethnic composition of the communities it serves, including people of color, veterans, older workers and persons with physical and/or cognitive disabilities. 
 •Providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination and retaliation: in furtherance of this commitment, Columbia Care strictly prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment. 
 •Complying with all laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities, as well as employees’, independent contractors’, vendors’, unpaid interns’ and volunteers’ religious beliefs and observances. 
 Columbia Care is committed to all of the above without regard to race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, uniform service member and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, age, protected medical condition, genetic information, disability, or any other protected status in accordance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws.
Columbia Care employees are highly talented individuals who have educational achievements ranging from doctorates to masters to undergraduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as staff who have been trained on the job to uphold the highest standards as set by Columbia Care. It is currently a requirement that all of Columbia Care’s employees pass background checks.
In addition, the safety of Columbia Care’s employees is a priority and Columbia Care is committed to the prevention of illness and injury through the provision and maintenance of a healthy workplace. Columbia Care takes all reasonable steps to ensure staff are appropriately informed and trained to ensure the safety of themselves as well as others around them.

Columbia Care strives to provide an equal opportunity for all its employees to pursue career advancement and to consistently look within its organization for potential job candidates prior to posting employment offerings externally. Importantly, it does not embrace these policies solely out of altruism or an obligation under state requirements, but because it has learned from experience that the organization thrives and becomes more productive by maintaining a culture of inclusion where everyone feels valued and their individual contributions are appreciated and rewarded.
Competition
Columbia Care competes with other retail, manufacturing and cultivation license holders across the states in which it operates, as well as additional states. Many of Columbia Care’s competitors are smaller, local operators, as well as an increasing number of operators with a significant presence in multiple states that compete directly with Columbia Care for regional market share. In certain markets, a number of dispensaries and cultivators operate illegally and compete directly with Columbia Care. However, Columbia Care expects that law enforcement will increasingly respond to illicit market operators. In addition to physical dispensaries, Columbia Care also competes with third-party delivery services, which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services.
Further, as more U.S. jurisdictions pass legislation allowing adult-use of cannabis, Columbia Care expects an increased level of competition in the U.S. market. A number of publicly-traded companies are expanding operations to states that have decriminalized cannabis consumption. The increasingly competitive U.S. state markets may adversely affect the financial condition and operations of Columbia Care.
See “United States Regulatory Environment” for additional details as to the regulatory environment in which Columbia Care operates. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors” with respect to competition.

Intellectual Property
Columbia Care pursues patent and trademark protection around the world directed to its product and product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding cannabinoid products and devices. Patent prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign equivalents is often significantly narrowed by the time they are issued, if issued at all. Columbia Care expects this may be the case with respect to its pending patent applications referenced below. Columbia Care’s intellectual property strategy seeks to provide protection for its product and product candidates, through the prosecution of different types of patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and worldwide. 
Columbia Care’s patent portfolio covers a number of its products and product candidates. As of March 3, 2023, this portfolio included 1 issued U.S. patent and at least 12 pending patent applications owned by Columbia Care, filed in one or more of three jurisdictions, including Canada and the U.S., which have strong patent systems. The issued U.S. patent is projected to expire in 2037. The patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.
Our patent portfolio includes:
•6 pending patent applications, filed in the US and Canada, that protect our EleCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use, and devices comprising the compositions; 
 •These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 •
•11 pending patent applications, filed in the US and Canada, that protect our TheraCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use, kits for their use, devices comprising the compositions, and cartridges for use in devices; 
 •These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 •6 pending patent applications, filed in the US and Canada, that protect our ClaraCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use and administration, kits for their administration, and cartridges for use in devices; 
 •These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire in 2039, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 •and 1 patent application, filed in the US, that protect our Seed & Strain DabTabs, including claims to compositions and methods of their use. 
 •These applications, if granted, are projected to expire in 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 While the USPTO has granted many patents for cannabis-related technologies, none have yet been successfully enforced in court. Until U.S. courts definitively address the enforceability of cannabis-related patents, or cannabis products are legalized federally in the U.S., we cannot be certain that any of our patents can be effectively enforced against our competitors, even if their products infringe our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The USPTO may deny federal trademark registration if the trademark application covers goods or services that violate federal law, including cannabis products. However, certain hemp-derived goods, including hemp-derived CBD products with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis, as well as ancillary products or services, are considered lawful under federal law and may be eligible for federal trademark registration. Additionally, the USPTO may accept trademark applications for consulting services or goods that do not directly involve the cannabis flower, such as computer software, educational platforms, and brand apparel. Trademarks covering these lawful goods and services are generally enforceable in federal court. Cannabis goods and services that do not meet the USPTO standard for trademark registration may qualify for state trademark registration in states where such goods and services have been legalized, and are generally enforceable in state courts in those states.No guarantee can be given that Columbia Care will be able to successfully assert its trademark rights, nor can the company guarantee that its trademark registrations will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any such invalidity, particularly with respect to a product name, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against the company, could have a material

adverse effect on Columbia Care’s business.In addition to patents and trademarks, Columbia Care relies upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain its competitive position. Columbia Care has developed numerous proprietary technologies and processes. While actively exploring the patentability of these techniques and processes, Columbia Care relies on non- disclosure/confidentiality arrangements and trade secret protection.Columbia Care seeks to protect its proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with third parties, its collaborators, and scientific advisors, and as well as non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with its employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements it enters into are designed to protect its proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to the Company are designed to grant it ownership of technologies that are developed through its relationship with the respective counterparty. Columbia Care cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford it adequate protection of its intellectual property and proprietary information rights.Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, some of Columbia Care’s trade secrets and know-how for which it decides to not pursue additional patent protection may, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology.
 UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Federal Regulatory Environment

Under U.S. federal law, marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug. The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”) classifies drugs in five different schedules. As a Schedule I drug, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. In October of 2022, President Joseph R. Biden announced that marijuana scheduling under federal law would be reviewed, directing federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to review the scheduling status of marijuana under the CSA. In his announcement, the president noted that marijuana is scheduled as more dangerous than fentanyl which has contributed to a nationwide epidemic of overdose deaths. Following the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”), cannabis with a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) content below 0.3% dry weight volume is classified as hemp and has been removed from the CSA. Hemp and products derived from it lawfully cultivated or manufactured in accordance with the 2018 Farm Bill, U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations and applicable state laws may now be sold into commerce and transported across state lines. The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserves the authority of the FDA to regulate certain products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds such as CBD under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In conjunction with the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the regulatory status of CBD, noting the FDA’s position that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. In January of 2023, the FDA issued a statement in connection with its denial of three citizen petitions requesting that the agency engage in rulemaking to establish regulations under which CBD derived from hemp could be legally marketed as a dietary ingredient in foods and dietary supplements. FDA stated that it is seeking assistance from Congress to create a new regulatory pathway that is better designed to regulate products that contain hemp derived cannabanoids, including CBD. In the interim, FDA stated that products (including dietary supplements, conventional foods, and animal foods) on the market are at risk of FDA enforcement as the agency deems “appropriate.” To date, the FDA’s enforcement actions against companies manufacturing CBD products has primarily been limited to the issuance of warning letters to companies whose products have made prohibited, misleading, and unapproved drug claims. Various states have also enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp consumable products. While some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of hemp-derived CBD consumable products or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in such activities, other states restrict the sale of CBD products or prohibit such products outright.

Under federal law, cannabis having a concentration of THC greater than 0.3% by dry weight volume is marijuana. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I drug is inconsistent with what Columbia Care believes to be many valuable medical uses for marijuana accepted by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. As evidence of this, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex (CBD) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from marijuana. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a cannabinoid found in both hemp and marijuana, which does not contain the intoxication properties of THC, the primary psychoactive component of marijuana. Columbia Care believes the CSA categorization as a Schedule I drug is not reflective of the medicinal properties of marijuana or the public perception thereof, and

numerous studies show cannabis is not able to be abused in the same way as other Schedule I drugs, has medicinal properties, and can be safely administered. Moreover, while certain published studies show that marijuana may be less harmful than alcohol, alcohol is not classified under the CSA. This disparity may reflect the comparative stigma associated with marijuana that factors into scheduling decisions by the DEA.

The federal position is also not necessarily consistent with democratic approval of marijuana at the state government level in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, 37 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands have passed laws broadly legalizing marijuana for medicinal use by eligible patients. In the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and 21 of these states – Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington – marijuana is legal for adult-use regardless of medical condition, although not all of those jurisdictions have fully implemented their legalization programs. As more and more states legalized medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal prohibition under the CSA and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal law enforcement agencies and banking institutions through a series of United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) memoranda. One significant memorandum was drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole in 2013 (the “Cole Memo”).

The Cole Memo offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states. The Cole Memo put forth eight prosecution priorities:
1.Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
 2.Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
 3.Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
 4.Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
 5.Preventing the violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
 6.Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
 7.Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and 
 8.Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 
 
On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Jefferson Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys (the “Sessions Memo”). Rather than establish national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo instructs that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the DOJ’s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.

The former Attorneys General who succeeded former Attorney General Sessions following his resignation did not provide a clear policy directive for the United States as it pertains to state-legal marijuana-related activities. It is still not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memo or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Justice Garland stated at a confirmation hearing in 2021 before the United States Senate that “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don’t think that’s a useful use.” [1]  Recently, in testimony in February of 2023 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Garland said the DOJ is “still working on a marijuana policy” and that policy – when issued – “will be very close to what was done in the Cole Memorandum.”[2]

[2] Ben Adlin, (March 1, 2023) Biden’s Attorney General says DOJ is ‘still working on’ federal marijuana policy approach. https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-attorney-general-says-doj-is-still-working-on-federal-marijuana-policy-approach/
 
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions.

Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole Memo, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys, and notwithstanding public statements to the contrary, federal law enforcement could enforce the CSA – and its criminal prohibition on commercial cannabis activity -- vigorously.
Due to the CSA categorization of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, federal law also makes it illegal for financial institutions that depend on the Federal Reserve’s money transfer system to take any proceeds from marijuana sales as deposits. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses under the United States Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy.
While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), in 2014, issued guidance to prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes (the “FinCEN Guidance”). The FinCEN Guidance advised prosecutors not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses so long as that business is legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memo are being violated (such as keeping marijuana away from children and out of the hands of organized crime). The FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including thorough customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps include:
1.Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; 
 2.Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business; 
 3.Requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; 
 4.Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers); 
 5.Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; 
 6.Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and 
 7.Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. 
 
With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.

Because most banks and other financial institutions are unwilling to provide any banking or financial services to marijuana businesses, these businesses can be forced into becoming “cash-only” businesses. While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for banks and financial institutions considering serving the industry, in practice it has not substantially increased banks’ willingness to provide services to marijuana businesses. This is because, as described above, the current law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each marijuana business they accept as a customer.

Those state-chartered banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry charge marijuana businesses high fees to pass on the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance.
Unlike the Cole Memo, however, the FinCEN Guidance from 2014 has not been rescinded.
 Despite the rescission of the Cole Memo in 2018, Columbia Care continues to do the following towards ensuring compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidance, and other best industry practices:
Columbia Care and its subsidiaries operate in compliance with licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions.

Columbia Care’s cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained – for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, products are sold only to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis.
Columbia Care performs due diligence on contractors or anyone provided access to secure areas of its facilities to prevent cannabis products from being distributed to minors.
Columbia Care works to ensure that the licensed operators have an adequate inventory tracking system and adequate procedures in place so that their compliance system can track inventory effectively. This is done so that there is no diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across state lines in general.
Columbia Care conducts background checks as required by applicable state law.
Columbia Care conducts reviews of activities of the cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of its licensed premises (including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation – e.g., transfer of products between licensed premises). These reviews are completed to ensure that licensed operators do not possess or use cannabis on federal property or engage in manufacturing or cultivation of cannabis on federal lands.
Columbia Care’s product packaging complies with applicable regulations and contains necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
Moreover, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the medical marijuana industries have also been in effect for several years. For instance, certain marijuana businesses receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of temporary appropriations measures that have been enacted into law as amendments (or “riders”) to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by the past three presidents. For instance, in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress included a budget “rider” that prohibits DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a state’s implementation of its own medical marijuana laws. The rider is known as the “Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment” after its original lead sponsors.
 The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was renewed most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2023, which funds the agencies of the federal government through September 30, 2023. Notably, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. While the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included in successive appropriations legislation or resolutions since 2015, its inclusion or non-inclusion is subject to political change. 
There is a growing consensus among marijuana businesses and numerous congressmen and congresswomen that guidance and temporary legislation are an inappropriate way to protect cannabis businesses. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress in recent years to decriminalize aspects of state-legal marijuana trades. This has led to a bipartisan Congressional Marijuana Working Group in Congress. In December 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, which provides for significantly broader opportunities to study cannabis. Other important measures have received successful votes in congressional committees or passage in the U.S. House of Representatives. For instance, the SAFE Banking Act, which had more than 200 cosponsors and would prevent federal banking regulators from taking adverse actions against financial institutions solely due to an institution’s provision of financial services to state-legal marijuana businesses, passed the U.S. House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support in 2019 and 2021, and again passed the House as an amendment to the America COMPETES Act in 2022. However, the SAFE Banking Act has failed to pass the U.S. Senate.
An additional challenge to marijuana-related businesses is that the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 280E (“Section 280E”), are being applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use marijuana industry. Section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. As a result of Section 280E, the Company’s effective tax rate can be highly variable and depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be.
State Regulatory Environment
The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in the states in which Columbia Care operates. While Columbia Care works to ensure that its operations comply with applicable state laws, regulations, and licensing requirements, for the reasons described above and the risks further described under the heading “Risk Factors”, there are significant risks associated with the

business of Columbia Care. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read and consider all of the risk factors contained under the heading “Risk Factors” below.
Except as described above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Columbia Care is in material compliance with applicable law and has not received any citations or notices of violation which have an impact on Columbia Care’s licenses, business activities or operations.
ARIZONA
Arizona Regulatory Landscape
In 2010, Arizona passed Ballot Proposition 203, which amended Title 36 to the Arizona Revised Statutes. This amendment added Chapter 28.1, titled the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (the “AMMA”). The AMMA is codified in Arizona Revised Statutes § 36-2801 et. seq. The AMMA also appointed the Arizona Department of Health Services (“ADHS”) as the regulator for the program and authorized ADHS to promulgate, adopt and enforce regulations for the AMMA. These ADHS regulations are embodied in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9 Chapter 17 (the “Medical Rules”). ARS § 36-2801(12) defines a “‘nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary’” as a not-for-profit entity that acquires, possesses, cultivates, manufactures, delivers, transfers, transports, supplies, sells or dispenses marijuana or related supplies and educational materials to cardholders. 
The ADHS has established the medical marijuana program, which includes a vertically integrated license, meaning if allocated a Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificate (a “Certificate”), entities are authorized to dispense and cultivate medical cannabis. Each Certificate allows the holding entity to operate one on-site cultivation facility, and one off-site cultivation facility which can be located anywhere within the State of Arizona. An entity holding a Certificate is required to file an application to renew with the ADHS on a biannual basis, which must also include audited annual financial statements.

To qualify to use medical marijuana under the AMMA, a patient is required to have a debilitating medical condition. Valid medical conditions include but may not be limited to HIV, cancer, glaucoma, immune deficiency syndrome, Hepatitis C, Crohn’s disease, agitation of Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, cachexia/wasting syndrome, muscle spasms, nausea, seizures, severe and chronic pain or another chronic or debilitating condition.
Arizona S.B. 1494 went into effect in August 2019. The bill authorized the ADHS to adopt rules for inspecting medical marijuana dispensaries and created an independent testing regime for marijuana cultivated by a medical marijuana dispensary. Beginning in November 2020, before marijuana is sold, it must be tested for unsafe levels of microbial contamination, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, growth regulators and residual solvents.
S.B. 1494 also authorized civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation (not to exceed $5,000 in a 30-day period) on medical marijuana dispensaries. Regulations implementing S.B. 1494 went into effect on August 27, 2019. The Department promulgated amendments to the medical marijuana regulations, which became effective September 8, 2022. Changes include, among other things, a new process to apply for changes to registrations, such as changes of location and additional laboratory testing requirements.
 In 2020, Arizona passed Ballot Proposition 207, which amended Title 36 to the Arizona Revised Statutes. This amendment added Chapter 28.2, titled the Smart and Safe Arizona Act (the “SSAA”). The SSAA is codified in Arizona Revised Statutes § 36-2850 et. seq. The SSAA appointed ADHS as the regulator for the program and required ADHS to promulgate, adopt, and enforce regulations for the SSAA. ADHS first published rules to administer the Adult- use Marijuana Program in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9 Chapter 18 (the “Adult-use Rules;” together with the Medical Rules, the “Rules”). These Adult-use Rules became effective on January 15, 2021. ADHS promulgated additional amendments to the Adult-use Rules effective September 8, 2022, which make changes, among others, to the requirements for marijuana establishments preparing food or beverages and additional laboratory testing requirements. ARS § 36-2850 defines “marijuana establishment” as an entity licensed by the department to operate all of the following: a single retail location at which the licensee may sell marijuana and marijuana products to consumers, cultivate marijuana and manufacture marijuana products; a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers; and a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of Arizona) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Arizona.

Arizona Medical Marijuana Licensing Requirements
In order for an applicant to receive a Certificate, it must: (i) fill out an application on the form prescribed by ADHS, (ii) submit the applicant’s articles of incorporation and by-laws, (iii) submit fingerprints for each principal officer or board member of the applicant for a background check to exclude felonies, (iv) submit a business plan and policies and procedures for inventory control, security, patient education, and patient recordkeeping that are consistent with the AMMA and the Medical Rules to ensure that the dispensary will operate in compliance, and (v) designate an Arizona licensed physician as the Medical Director for the dispensary. Certificates are renewed biannually so long as the dispensary is in good standing with ADHS, pays the renewal fee, and submits an independent third-party financial audit.
Once an applicant has been issued a Certificate, they are allowed to establish one physical retail dispensary location, one cultivation location which is co-located at the dispensary’s retail site (if allowed by local zoning) and one additional off-site cultivation location. None of these sites can be operational, however, until the dispensary receives an approval to operate from ADHS for the applicable site. This approval to operate requires: (i) an application on the ADHS form, (ii) demonstration of compliance with local zoning regulations, (iii) a site plan and floor plan for the applicable property, and (iv) an in-person inspection by ADHS of the applicable location to ensure compliance with the Medical Rules and consistency with the dispensary’s applicable policies and procedures.
Arizona Adult-use Marijuana Licensing Requirements
In order for an applicant to receive a marijuana facility agent license, it must submit to ADHS (i) the personal identification information prescribed by ADHS including a background check and fingerprints and (ii) the applicable fee as prescribed in the Adult-use Rules. The license must be renewed every two years. A licensee may seek renewal by submitting to ADHS, at least thirty calendar days before the license expiration, (a) information on the license, (b) updated personal information including a criminal records check, and (c) the applicable fee as prescribed in the Adult- use Rules.
ADHS may issue one marijuana establishment license for every 10 pharmacies registered under § 32-1929 and no more than two licenses per county that contains no registered medical marijuana dispensaries, or one license per county that contains one registered medical marijuana dispensary. In the event that more complete and compliant applications are received than ADHS may issue, ADHS will issue the licenses according to criteria prescribed in the Adult-use Rules. The initial round of license applications were due March 9, 2021.
In order for an application to be considered complete and compliant such that an applicant may be considered for a marijuana establishment license, the applicant must (i) pay the appropriate non-refundable fee prescribed by ADHS, (ii) submit the ADHS-prescribed application, (iii) documentation of: facility agent licenses for principal officers and board members, good standing with the Arizona Corporation Commission, zoning compliance, ownership of or permission to use the physical address, and sufficient funds.
Applicants that have a Certificate issued under the Medical Rules, the applicant may apply for a marijuana establishment license by submitting (i) an attestation from each principal officer and board member approving the application, (ii) the license number on the applicant’s dispensary registration certificate, (iii) whether the applicant wants to transfer the cultivation site under the registration certificate to the marijuana license, and (iv) the applicable fee.
A holder of a marijuana establishment license may apply for approval to operate a marijuana establishment by submitting, within 18 months after the marijuana establishment license was issued, the following: (i) an application on the form prescribed by ADHS, (ii) documentation of local permission to use the property as a marijuana establishment (such as a certificate of occupancy, special use permit, or a conditional use permit), (iii) a list of activities the establishment is requesting, including cultivation, manufacturing, or preparation of edible products, (iv) a license of the location as a food establishment if preparing edible products, (v) a site plan, and (vi) a floor plan.
Marijuana establishments that received their license through the process for applicants with Certificates may begin operating without submitting the above if the entity holding the license (i) received approval to operate under the Medical Rules and (ii) is operating and available to dispense medical marijuana in accordance with the Medical Rules.
Marijuana establishment licenses must be renewed every two years.

ADHS Inspections and Enforcement
ADHS may inspect a medical facility at any time upon five (5) days’ notice to the dispensary. However, if someone has alleged that the dispensary is not in compliance with the AMMA or the Medical Rules, ADHS may conduct an unannounced inspection. ADHS will provide written notice to the dispensary of any violations found during any inspection and the dispensary then has 20 working days to take corrective action and notify ADHS.
ADHS must revoke a Certificate if a dispensary: (i) operates before obtaining approval to operate a dispensary from ADHS, (ii) dispenses, delivers, or otherwise transfers cannabis to an entity other than another licensed dispensary, a qualifying patient with a valid registry identification card, a designated caregiver with a valid registry identification card, or a laboratory with a valid laboratory registration certificate, (iii) acquires usable cannabis or mature cannabis plants from any entity other than another licensed dispensary, a qualifying patient with a valid registry identification card, or a designated caregiver with a valid registry identification card, or (iv) if a principal officer or board member has been convicted of an excluded felony offense.
Furthermore, ADHS may revoke a Certificate if a dispensary does not: (i) comply with the requirements of AMMA or the Medical Rules, (ii) implement the policies and procedures or comply with the statements provided to ADHS with the dispensary’s application.
ADHS may inspect an adult-use facility at any time during regular hours of operation. ADHS must make at least one unannounced visit annually to each licensed facility.

CALIFORNIA
California Regulatory Landscape
In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.
In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.
In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. AUMA had some conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. The four agencies that originally regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), California Department of Food and Agriculture (“DFA”), California Department of Public Health (“DPH”), and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018.
On July 1, 2019, California enacted A.B. 97. In relevant part, the bill authorizes licensing authorities to issue citations and fines to a licensee or an unlicensed person who violates MAUCRSA. The maximum fine is $5,000 per violation for licensees and $30,000 per violation for unlicensed persons. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation.
A.B. 97 also repeals a prior requirement that an applicant for a provisional license first hold a temporary license. The bill also requires applicants for provisional licenses to submit evidence of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, limits the validity of a provisional license to 12 months with subsequent renewals as approved by the relevant licensing authority, and allows licensing authorities to revoke provisional licenses for failing to diligently pursue final licensure. Finally, the bill requires the DPH to establish a

certification program for manufactured cannabis products comparable to the National Organic Program and the California Organic Food and Farming Act.
On October 12, 2019, California enacted A.B. 1529. The bill mandates that all cannabis vaping cartridges and cannabis vaporizers must include a universal symbol identifying the product as a vaping product.
On July 12, 2021, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 141 (AB-141), which creates the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). The DCC will consolidate the state’s cannabis program oversight from three of the existing agencies – the BCC, the DFA, and the DPH – under a single department in an effort to centralize and simplify regulatory and licensing oversight in California. DCC similarly announced its intention to create a single Licensing Division that would be responsible for licensing of all cannabis businesses. On or about September 15, 2021, the DCC filed emergency regulations to consolidate, clarify, and make consistent cannabis regulations to the California Office of Administrative Law. After a limited comment period, these consolidated emergency regulations were approved and became effective on or about September 27, 2021. These regulations created consistent standards for cannabis licensees across all license types, by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements. Consolidated regulations became effective on a non-emergency basis on November 7, 2022. Additional regulatory amendments promulgated in 2022 include requirements and procedures to apply to DCC for a Large Cultivation License under MAUCRSA and emergency rules for track and trace requirements for delivery vehicles. 
Additional statutory amendments signed into law in 2022, include, among other things, classification of cannabis beverages as a form of edible cannabis product and allowance of more packaging types for beverages, requiring applicants with 20 or more employees to execute labor peace agreements (this requirement applies to applicants with 10 or more employees after July 1, 2024), additional taxation rules, new advertising and labeling rules for cannabis vaporizer products, and a prohibition on local laws that prohibit delivery of medicinal products to qualifying patients.
At present, to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with marijuana licensing programs. Therefore, cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators or can choose to outright ban marijuana.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of California) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of California.

 California Licensing Requirements
A medicinal retailer license permits the sale of medicinal cannabis and cannabis products to a medicinal cannabis patient in California who possesses a physician’s recommendation. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older who presents a valid government-issued photo identification.
An adult-use or medicinal cultivation license permits cannabis cultivation activity which means any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and the sales of cannabis to certain licensed entities within the state of California for resale or manufacturing purposes.
An adult-use or medical manufacturing license permits the manufacturing of cannabis products. Manufacturing includes the compounding, blending, extracting, infusion, packaging or repackaging, labeling or relabeling, or other preparation of a cannabis product.
In the state of California, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. Although California is not a vertically-integrated system, the state allows licensees to make wholesale purchase of cannabis from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state.
Holders of marijuana licenses in California are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, sales, manufacturing standards, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations, as promulgated by each applicable state agency, should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area.
California Dispensary Requirements
Cannabis retailers may only sell cannabis products that were received by the retail licensee from a licensed distributor or licensed microbusiness authorized to engage in distribution, and the licensed retailer must verify that the cannabis goods have not exceeded their best-by, sell-by, or expiration date if one is provided. The goods must have undergone appropriate laboratory testing, and the batch number labeled on the package of cannabis goods must match the batch number on the corresponding certificate of analysis for regulatory compliance testing. The packaging and goods must comply with all applicable laws in order for the goods to be sold at the

retail location. In addition to cannabis goods, a licensed retailer may sell only cannabis accessories and licensee’s branded merchandise. A licensed retailer may not provide free cannabis goods except for in certain limited circumstances.
Cannabis retailers may only display cannabis goods for inspection and sale in the retail area. Such goods may be removed from their packaging and placed in containers to allow for customer inspection, so long as the containers are not readily accessible to customers without assistance of retailer personnel. A container must be provided to the customer by the licensed retailer or its employees, who must remain with the customer at all times that the container is being inspected by the customer. Cannabis goods removed from their packaging in this way may not be sold or consumed. They must be destroyed appropriately when they are no longer being used for display.
California Reporting Requirements
The state of California uses METRC as the state’s track-and-trace (“T&T”) system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all state-issued annual licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to METRC.
California Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements
To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, California’s marijuana businesses are required to do the following:
•maintain a fully operational security alarm system; 
 •contract for security guard services; 
 •maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day; 
 •ensure that the facility’s outdoor premises have sufficient lighting; 
 •not dispense from its premises outside of permissible hours of operation; 
 •store cannabis and cannabis product only in areas per the premises diagram submitted to the state of California during the licensing process; 
 •store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault; 
 •report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion, or loss of cannabis; and 
 •ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities, maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products. Only vehicles registered with the BCC that meet BCC distribution requirements are to be used to transport cannabis and cannabis products. 
 
DCC Inspections
The DCC, and its authorized representatives, shall have full and immediate access to inspect and enter onto any premises licensed by the DCC. Prior notice of an inspection, investigation, review, or audit is not required. The DCC may also test any vehicle or equipment possessed by, in control of, or used by a licensee or their agents and employees for the purpose of conducting commercial cannabis activity. Moreover, it may test any cannabis goods or cannabis-related materials, or products possessed by, in control of, or used by a licensee or their agents and employees for the purpose of conducting commercial cannabis activity. The DCC may also copy any materials, books, or records of any licensee or their agents and employees. Failure to cooperate with and participate in any DCC investigation pending against the licensee may result in a licensing violation subject to discipline.
COLORADO
Colorado Regulatory Landscape
On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. On November 6, 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which amended the state constitution to establish an adult use cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014 at cannabis businesses licensed under the regulatory framework. As of January 1, 2020, medical and adult use marijuana are regulated together under a single statute – the Colorado Marijuana Code. 

Under the Colorado Marijuana Code, the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue is empowered to grant licenses to both adult use and medical marijuana businesses, including cultivation facilities, products manufacturers, testing facilities, transporters, researchers and developers, and (in the adult use context) accelerator cultivators, accelerator stores, and hospitality businesses. The Colorado Marijuana Code underwent amendments in 2022, which include, among other things, changes to the requirements for physical or virtual separation of operations for co-located adult use and medical dispensaries, transfers of product between commonly owned medical and adult use marijuana cultivation facilities, responsible vendor training, and limitations on the use of modified or synthetic intoxicating cannabanoids. The MED promulgated comprehensive amendments to its regulations effective December 1, 2022. Cannabis businesses must also comply with local licensing requirements. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana businesses. Columbia Care in Colorado follows the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Colorado. 
Colorado License Requirements
An application for a marijuana business in Colorado requires submission of (1) a copy of any local license required for the marijuana business, (2) a certificate of good standing from the jurisdiction in which the business was formed, (3) the identity and address of the registered agent in Colorado, (4) organizational documents such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, articles of organization, and similar documents, (5) corporate governance documents, (6) a deed, lease, or similar document establishing the applicant’s ability to use the proposed premises, (7) a facility diagram, (8) findings of suitability with respect to the business’ owners, (8) information regarding securities listings (if the business is publicly traded), (9) financial statements, and documents related to payments of taxes. A business is required to obtain permission from its locality as part of the licensing process.

 * Currently in the process of renewal 
With respect to the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and no substantial violations exist, Columbia Care would expect to receive the applicable renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business.

Regulatory Requirements
The regulations establish requirements applicable to all marijuana businesses, along with specific requirements for each type of business.
All marijuana businesses in Colorado are required to (1) create and enforce limited access areas for the protection of marijuana and marijuana products, (2) maintain security alarm systems installed and maintained by a licensed alarm installation company, as well as approved locks and surveillance equipment, (3) follow all applicable laws regarding waste disposal (including cannabis-containing wastes), (4) implement an inventory tracking system used for inventory tracking and recordkeeping, (5) comply with both state and local requirements as to hours of operation, (6) comply with sanitary requirements applicable to employees and production spaces, including sanitation audits, (7) comply with recordkeeping requirements, and (8) maintain and provide procedures for dealing with product recalls.
Cultivation facilities are additionally required to (1) provide and maintain copies of standard operating procedures for cultivation, harvesting, drying, curing, trimming, packaging, storing, and sampling, (2) comply with requirements related to pesticides, and (3) comply with additional sanitary and product safety requirements. Marijuana products manufacturers are required to (1) comply with labeling and dosing requirements related to standardized doses of marijuana, (2) comply with specific prohibitions regarding the shapes, colors, and similar characteristics of edible products, refrain from use of prohibited additives and ingredients, (3) maintain and provide standard operating procedures related to manufacturing of each category of products. Marijuana dispensaries are subject to additional requirements regarding (1) methods of accepting orders, (2) payments by customers, and (3) identification of customers.
The Marijuana Enforcement Division and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present.
Colorado uses METRC as the Marijuana Enforcement Division’s marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities.
DELAWARE
Delaware Regulatory Landscape
Delaware’s medical marijuana program is governed by the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act, 16 Del. C.
§ 4901A et seq., and the Department of Health and Social Services’ (the “Department”) implementing regulations, CDR 16-4000-4470. The program authorizes registered qualified patients with a debilitating medical condition to use marijuana. “Debilitating medical condition” includes: (a) terminal illness, cancer, HIV, AIDS, decompensated cirrhosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, agitation of Alzheimer’s disease, PTSD, intractable epilepsy, seizure disorder, glaucoma, chronic debilitating migraines; (b) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment that produces cachexia or wasting syndrome; severe, debilitating pain that has not responded to previously prescribed medication or surgical measures for more than 3 months or for which other treatment options produced serious side effects; intractable nausea; seizures; severe and persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis; and (c) other medical conditions or treatments that may be added by the Department. Citizens may petition the Department to add conditions or treatments to the list of debilitating medical conditions.
The medical marijuana program creates a licensing regime for medical marijuana compassion centers (“Compassion Centers”). Compassion Centers must be operated on a non-profit basis. Once registered, a Compassion Center may acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or dispense marijuana strictly for the purpose of assisting registered patients or their designated caregivers with the medical use of marijuana. Compassion Centers are required to grow an amount of marijuana sufficient to meet demand but may not possess more than 1,000 pounds of usable marijuana without having a variance approved by the Department. Delaware prohibits Compassion Centers from purchasing marijuana from any person other than another Compassion Center.
On May 24, 2022, Governor John Carney vetoed legislation passed by the Delaware General Assembly that would have legalized the adult use of cannabis, and created a state-run commercial adult-use cannabis program. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Delaware) follows the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Delaware. 
Delaware License Requirements
Applicants for a license to operate a Compassion Center must include a US$5,000 application fee along with identifying documentation about the proposed Compassion Center, such as the proposed legal name, bylaws, articles of incorporation, and proposed address. An application must include information about the proposed facility, including: a description of the enclosed, locked facility, meeting all Department requirements for use in the cultivation of marijuana; and a description of proposed security and safety measures which demonstrate compliance with the Department’s regulations. The Department also requires applicants to disclose financial and organizational information. Such information must include evidence of the Compassion Center’s non-profit status; identifying information for each principal officer and board member; a draft operations manual which demonstrates compliance with the Department’s regulations; a list of persons or business entities having direct or indirect authority over the management or policies of the Compassion Center; a list of persons or business entities having 5.0% or more ownership in the Compassion Center, including owners of any business entity which owns all or part of the land or building; and the identities of creditors holding a security interest in the premises, if any. Applications must also include an example of the design and security features of medical marijuana containers which demonstrates compliance with the regulations. In 2022, the Delaware General Assembly amended the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act to require applicants with 20 or more employees to execute a labor peace agreement.
When the Department notifies an applicant that its application to operate a Compassion Center has been approved, it must submit a number of additional items before the registration certificate authorizing operation of a Compassion Center will be issued: a certification fee of US$40,000; the legal name, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of the Compassion Center; the physical address of the Compassion Center and any other address used for cultivation; evidence of compliance with zoning laws, other location restrictions, and the State Fire Code; and updates to previously submitted information.
Delaware Dispensary Requirements
Registered Compassion Centers are required to keep detailed financial reports of proceeds and expenses; maintain inventory, sales, and financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and provide Department or Department-contracted audit firms with access to its books and records.

Compassion Centers must comply with a detailed process for disposing of unusable marijuana. A Compassion Center must immediately update its inventory system to reflect a disposal of marijuana, and the marijuana waste must be stored, secured, and managed in a manner that renders the waste unusable. Delaware also prohibits the use of pesticides on marijuana.
The Department has promulgated regulations specific to the dispensing of marijuana. Marijuana must be dispensed in sealed, tamperproof containers clearly identified as having been issued by the Compassion Center and that include certain disclosures. The containers should be accompanied by written instruction that the marijuana shall remain in this container when it is not being prepared for ingestion or being ingested. Compassion Centers must verify the patient’s or caregiver’s identification card as valid before dispensing marijuana, and marijuana must not be dispensed to a person other than a qualifying patient or primary caregiver. The maximum amount a Compassion Center can dispense to a single patient is 3 ounces during a 14-day period.

Delaware Licenses
Columbia Care operates through a management services arrangement with Columbia Care Delaware LLC, a non- profit affiliate that holds a Compassion Center license and operates a dispensary and a manufacturing center, as noted in the table below.

 Compassion Centers’ registrations expire every two years. A renewal application must be submitted between 90 and 30 days prior to the expiration of the current registration certificate. With respect to the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care Delaware LLC would expect to receive the applicable renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business.
Delaware Security, Storage, and Transportation Requirements
Compassion Centers must store marijuana in a locked area with adequate security. The adequacy of security is to be determined based on the quantity of usable marijuana on hand, the Compassion Center’s inventory system, the number of people with access to the marijuana, the location of the Compassion Center, the scope and sustainability of the alarm system, and the root cause analysis of any prior breaches. Compassion Centers are also subject to detailed security and inventory-management requirements. A Compassion Center must implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and the theft of marijuana. This includes access and entry limitations; maintaining a fully operational alarm system with immediate automatic notification to alert local authorities of a security breach; maintaining a log of security inspections and tests, alarm activations, and security breaches; and instituting a 24/7 video surveillance system covering areas in which marijuana is handled. The Department has also instituted a number of inventory controls. Compassion Centers must utilize a bar-coding inventory control system to track sales and inventory data; store marijuana in a locked area with adequate security; and conduct and document monthly inventory reviews and bi-annual comprehensive inventory reviews.
A registered Compassion Center agent must have documentation when transporting marijuana on behalf of the registered Compassion Center that specifies the amount of marijuana being transported, the date the marijuana is being transported, the registry ID certificate number of the registered Compassion Center or registered safety compliance facility, and a contact number to verify that the marijuana is being transported on behalf of the registered Compassion Center or registered safety compliance facility.
Department Inspections
Compassion Centers are also subject to inspections by the Department’s Office of Medical Marijuana. These inspections may include: a review of the Compassion Center’s financial and dispensing records; a review of the physical facility; an inspection for pesticides, fungus, or mold; and random sampling of marijuana plants. Moreover, the Department or an independent auditor with which it contracts shall at all times have access to all books and records kept by any Compassion Center.
FLORIDA
Florida Regulatory Landscape
In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act. The original Compassionate Use Act only allowed for low-THC cannabis to be dispensed and purchased by patients suffering from cancer and epilepsy. In 2016, the Legislature passed the Right To Try Act which allowed for full potency cannabis to be dispensed to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition. Also in 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed with a 71.3% majority on November 8. This language amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the state’s medical cannabis program.
The Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative, Amendment 2 (“Amendment 2”), and the expanded qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. The Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations, and patients are also subject to Article X Section 29 of the Florida Constitution and § 381.986 of the Florida Statutes. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program by replacing large portions of the existing Compassionate Use Act, which officially became law on June 23, 2017. The law regulating Amendment 2 provides for another four licenses to be issued for every 100,000 patients added to the state’s medical marijuana registry and allows growers to open 25 dispensaries, plus an additional five dispensaries for every 100,000 patients. The 2017 legislation’s cap on dispensing facilities expired on April 1, 2020 and there is now no limit. There is also no state-imposed limitation on the permitted size of cultivation or processing facilities in Florida, nor is there a limit on the number of plants that may be grown. In Florida, medical marijuana may not be wholesaled, except for limited circumstances in which a medical marijuana treatment center that seeks to make a purchase of marijuana presents proof of harvest failure to the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use (“OMMU”).
In 2022, the OMMU issued of notice of its intent to award one MMTC license to a so-called “Pigford” (Qualified Black Farmer) applicant, which is a recognized class member of Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) or In re Black Farmers Litigation, 856 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2011). Certain “Pigford” applicants have appealed OMMU’s denial of their license applications. Under emergency rules, the OMMU issued an application under which it will award up to 22 MMTC licenses to new applicants. License applications are due on or before April 28, 2023. Additionally, in 2017, the Florida legislature passed an act developing an industrial hemp pilot project, which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in Florida. The pilot project allowed for the research of industrial hemp. In 2019, the State Hemp Program (the “FL Act”) became effective and expanded the hemp program in Florida. The FL Act permitted the development of a state hemp plan by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (“FDACS”). In 2020, FDACS submitted a state plan for regulation of industrial hemp to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Florida’s plan.
The Florida Hemp Program includes several regulatory requirements. FDACS requires any individual or entity processing, manufacturing, distributing, retailing, or growing hemp to obtain a permit with FDACS. Other requirements include testing to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; inventory of land used for cultivation of hemp; disposal procedure plans; submission to inspection by and information sharing with FDACS; and state certification. Intentional violations of the Act and FDACS’s rules may result in criminal penalties and a loss of license. Repeated negligent violation may result in a suspension of license.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Florida) follows the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Florida.
Florida Licenses Subsection 381.986(8)(a) of the State of Florida Statutes provides a framework that requires licensed producers, which are statutorily defined as “Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers” (“MMTC”), to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. The Florida Legislature amended the statute in 2022, among other things, to authorize OMMU to test samples from MMTCs and to require product recalls in certain instances. Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the license meets the requirements of the law and the license holder pays a renewal fee. License holders can only own one license.

Under the terms of its MMTC license, Columbia Care’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Columbia Care Florida, is permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the state. Only certified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients and their medical cannabis orders on the Florida Office of Compassionate Use Registry. Dispensaries also must comply with a local municipality’s zoning, which authorize such a use. The proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and not within 500 feet of a church or school. In the State of Florida, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. As Florida is a vertically integrated system, Columbia Care Florida is able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver its own medical cannabis products.

Columbia Care Florida LLC | Medical MarijuanaTreatment Center –MMTC-2017-0011 | MultipleLocations | 05/19/2024 | Authorizes Columbia CareFlorida to cultivate,process, transport anddispense cannabis formedical use

 Florida Reporting Requirements OMMU requires that any licensee establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed, and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Additionally, the OMMU also maintains a patient and physician registry and Columbia Care must comply with requirements and regulations relative to providing required data or proof of key events to said system.
Florida Licensing Requirements 
Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the licensee meets requirements of the law and pays a renewal fee, which OMMU raised significantly by emergency rule in 2022. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care Florida would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
MMTC license holders can only own one license. An MMTC applicant must demonstrate that: (i) they have been registered to do business in the State of Florida for the previous five years, (ii) they possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture, (iii) they have the technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce cannabis, including, but not limited to, low-THC cannabis, (iv) they have the ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC, (v) they have the ability to maintain accountability of raw materials, finished products, and by-products to prevent diversion or unlawful access to or possession of these substances, (vi) they have an infrastructure reasonably required to dispense cannabis to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the OMMU, (vii) they have the financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the two-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the OMMU, (viii) its owners, officers, board members and managers have passed a Level II background screening, inclusive of fingerprinting, and ensure that a medical director is employed to supervise the activities of the MMTC, and (ix) they have a diversity plan and veterans plan accompanied by a contractual process for establishing business relationships with veterans and minority contractors and/or employees. Upon approval of the application by the OMMU, the applicant must post a performance bond of up to US$5 million, which may be reduced by meeting certain criteria such as serving at least 1,000 patients.


Florida Dispensary Requirements An MMTC may not dispense to a patient more than a 70-day supply of cannabis within a 70-day period, except an MMTC may not dispense more than a 35-day supply of marijuana in a form for smoking within a 35-day period. A physician may not certify a patient for more than six 35-day supplies of smokable cannabis. By law, a 35-day supply is 2.5 ounces of whole flower. In 2022, OMMU passed emergency regulations further stating that marijuana in a form for smoking shall only be dispensed by an MMTC as usable whole flower, ground usable whole flower, or prerolled marijuana cigarettes and prohibiting dispensing usable flower through other routes of administration, including vaporization. OMMU’s emergency rules also set daily dose and 70-day dosage limits for other forms of administration, such as edibles, vaporizers, and topicals. The emergency rules further set a total 70-dosage limit of 24,500 mg of THC in any form. The emergency rules authorize OMMU to grant exceptions for patients.
 The MMTC employee who dispenses the cannabis must enter into the registry his or her name or unique employee identifier. The MMTC must verify that: (i) the qualified patient and the caregiver, if applicable, each has an active registration in the registry and active and valid medical cannabis use registry identification card, (ii) the amount and type of cannabis dispensed matches the physician certification in the registry for the qualified patient, and (iii) the physician certification has not already been filled. An MMTC may not dispense to a qualified patient younger than 18 years of age, only to such patient’s caregiver. An MMTC may not dispense or sell any other type of cannabis, alcohol, or illicit drug-related product, except a cannabis delivery device as specified in the physician certification. An MMTC must, upon dispensing, record in the registry: 
(i)the date, time, quantity, and form of cannabis dispensed, 
 (ii)the type of cannabis delivery device dispensed, and 
 (iii)the name and registry identification number of the qualified patient or caregiver to whom the cannabis delivery device was dispensed. An MMTC must ensure that patient records are not visible to anyone other than the patient, caregiver, and MMTC employees. 
 In 2022, OMMU adopted emergency regulations establishing additional dispensing requirements in connection with website orders.
 Florida Security, Transportation, and Storage Requirements
Each MMTC must maintain a video surveillance system with specified features. MMTCs must retain video surveillance recordings for at least 45 days, or longer upon the request of law enforcement.
An MMTC’s outdoor premises must have sufficient lighting from dusk until dawn.

OMMU shall inspect an MMTC upon receiving a complaint or notice that the MMTC has dispensed cannabis containing mold, bacteria, or other contaminants that may cause an adverse effect to humans or the environment. OMMU shall conduct at least a biennial inspection of each MMTC to evaluate the MMTC’s records, personnel, equipment, security, sanitation practices, and quality assurance practices.
ILLINOIS
Illinois Regulatory Landscape
The Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition access to medical marijuana, became effective January 1, 2014 and has since been made permanent and retitled as the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act. There are over 35 qualifying conditions as part of the medical program, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, which provides access to medical marijuana for individuals who have or could receive a prescription for opioids. 
Illinois enacted the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in June 2019 (the “IL Act”). The IL Act legalized the adult use of marijuana effective January 1, 2020. Under the IL Act, Illinois residents age 21 and older are allowed to possess any combination of (i) up to 30 grams of raw marijuana, (ii) marijuana infused products containing no more than 500 mg of THC; and (iii) 5 grams of marijuana in concentrated form. Non-residents can possess any combination of (i) up to 15 grams of raw marijuana, (ii) marijuana infused products containing no more than 250 mg of THC; and (iii) 2.5 grams of marijuana in concentrated form. The IL Act also authorizes the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (“IDFPR”) to issue up to 75 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses before May 1, 2020 and an additional 110 conditional licenses during 2021. Existing medical dispensaries were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization License” to serve adult users at an existing medical dispensary or at a secondary site. Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the state of Illinois) received licenses as Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organizations and is operating medical and adult use dispensaries in Illinois. No person can hold a financial interest in more than 10 dispensing organizations.

On July 15, 2021, Governor Pritzker signed House Bill 1443, now Public Act 102-0098, modifying the IL Act and the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act and establishing a more comprehensive criteria to award the adult-use licenses. Muliple lotteries and corrective lotteries for the adult-use licenses were held in 2021 and 2022. As of December 21, 2022, IDFPR has issued 192 Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses to date. IDFPR announced an additional application period, ending April 21, 2023, to award an additional 55 Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses by lottery.

The Illinois Department of Agriculture is authorized to make up to 30 cultivation center licenses available between the state’s medical and adult-use programs. As with existing medical dispensaries, existing cultivation centers were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Center License.” The Department has issued approximately 21 Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Centers to date. Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the state of Illinois) received approval as Early Approval Use Cultivation Center and is operating as a medical and adult use cultivation center in Illinois. No person can hold a financial interest in more than three cultivation centers, and the centers are limited to 210,000 square feet of canopy space. Cultivation center are also prohibited from discriminating in price when selling to dispensaries, craft growers, or infuser organizations. The Department is also permitted to license up to 40 craft growers and 40 infuser organizations by July 1, 2020 and another 60 of each license type by the end of 2021. As of March 2, 2023, the Department has issued approximately 85 craft grower business establishment licenses and 55 business establishment infuser licenses.
The IL Act imposes several operational requirements on adult-use licensees and requires prospective licensees to demonstrate their plans for complying with the requirements. Applicants for dispensary licenses must, for example, include an employee training plan, a security plan, recordkeeping and inventory plans, a quality control plan, and an operating plan. Applicants for craft growers must similarly submit a facility plan, an employee training plan, a security a record keeping plan, a cultivation plan, a product safety and labeling plan, a business plan, an environmental plan, and more.
Licensees must establish methods for identifying, recording, and reporting diversion, theft, or loss, correcting inventory errors, and complying with product recalls. Licensees also must comply with detailed inventory, storage, and security requirements. Cultivation licenses are subject to similar operational requirements, such as complying with detailed security and storage requirements, and must also establish plans to address energy, water, and waste- management needs. Dispensary licenses will be renewed bi-annually, and cultivation licenses, craft grower licenses, infuser organization licenses, and transporter licenses will be renewed annually.

The Illinois Department of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations for cultivators, craft growers, infuser organizations, and transporting organizations, and the IDFPR is authorized to regulate dispensaries. The Department of Agriculture’s final rules took effect on June 3, 2020, while the IDFPR has not yet issued comprehensive operational regulations for the adult- use program.

Additionally, in 2015, the Illinois Industrial Hemp Pilot Program became effective pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill. This statute enabled researchers and higher education institutions to grow hemp for educational and research purposes. The Illinois Department of Agriculture (“IDOA”) administered the Industrial Hemp Pilot Program. In 2018, the Illinois Industrial Hemp Act (the “IL Hemp Act”) became effective. The IL Hemp Act allowed for the growing and processing to expand beyond researchers and higher education institutions and allowed planting and processing by farmers and others. IDOA was given authority to develop and oversee rules for the state hemp program.
IDOA promulgated rules for the state’s hemp program in 2019. An individual or entity cultivating, processing, or handling hemp must obtain a license from IDOA. The IL Hemp Act subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include filing a report on the harvest and planting; submission to inspection and sampling at the discretion of IDOA; testing to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; and certain restrictions on the sale and transport of hemp. Intentional violations of the IL Hemp Act and IODA’s rules may result in criminal penalties and a loss of license. Repeated negligent violation may result in a suspension of license.
In 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Illinois hemp production plan.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of Illinois) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Illinois.
Illinois Licenses
The table below lists the licenses issued to Columbia Care with respect to its operations in Illinois. Under applicable laws, the licenses permit Columbia Care to, collectively, cultivate and dispense marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation under the provisions of Illinois Revised Statutes 410 ILCS 130 and 410 ILCS 705. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Illinois.
There are two categories of medical cannabis licenses in Illinois: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity. All cultivation/processing establishments must register with Illinois Department of Agriculture. All dispensaries must register with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. If applications contain all required information, and after vetting by officers, establishments are issued a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email from the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and include a renewal form. Adult-use dispensary licenses must be renewed with the IDFPR prior to March 31 of every even-numbered year, while adult-use cultivation center licenses must be renewed annually.

Illinois Reporting Requirements
The state of Illinois uses BioTrack as the state’s computerized track and trace system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. Columbia Care integrates its in-house tracking system with the state’s BioTrack program to capture the data points required by the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act and the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act.
Illinois Storage and Security Requirements
As to its cultivation facility, the adult-use and medical-use laws and regulations require Columbia Care to store marijuana and marijuana infused products in a safe, vault, or secured room in such a manner to prevent diversion, theft, or loss. Marijuana that is not a finished product must likewise be maintained in a secured area within the facility only accessible to authorized personnel. Locks and security equipment safeguarding the marijuana must be kept in good working order, and the storage areas must be locked and protected from unauthorized access.
The cultivation facility must also have an operational 24-hour, seven-days-a-week, closed circuit television surveillance system on the premises that complies with certain regulatory minimum standards. Access to the surveillance area is restricted to those people who are essential to surveillance operations, law enforcement agencies, security system service personnel, and the regulator. In addition, video surveillance recordings must be retained for 90 days at the facility and an additional 90 days off site.
Columbia Care must also maintain an alarm system at its cultivation facility. The cultivation facility must maintain and use a professionally monitored robbery and burglary alarm system that meets certain regulatory minimum standards. A qualified alarm system vendor must test the system annually.
With respect to its Illinois dispensary, Columbia Care must store inventory on site in a secured and restricted access area consistent with the security regulations and track its inventory in accordance with the inventory tracking regulations.

This includes having a commercial grade alarm and surveillance system installed by an Illinois licensed private alarm contractor or private alarm contractor agency. The facility must also have security measures to protect the premises, customers and dispensing organization agents.
Illinois Transportation Requirements
Cultivation centers may transport cannabis in accordance with certain guidelines; however, cultivation centers will be prohibited from transporting adult-use cannabis without obtaining a separate transporting organization license beginning on July 1, 2020.
For medical marijuana, prior to transportation, a cultivation center must complete a shipping manifest using a form prescribed by the Department of Agriculture. The cultivation center must transmit a copy of the manifest to the dispensary facility that will receive the products and to the Department of Agriculture before the close of business the day prior to transport. Such shipping manifests must be maintained, and they must be provided to the Department of Agriculture at its request. Cannabis may only be transported in a locked storage compartment or container, and it must not be visible from outside the vehicle. Motor vehicles may not make detours while transporting cannabis except to dispensary facilities or laboratories, refueling stops, or emergencies. Emergencies must be immediately reported to 911 and the cultivation center, and the cultivation center must immediately notify the Department of Agriculture. Deliveries must be randomized, and there must be a minimum of two employees on each transport team. At least one team member must remain with the vehicle whenever the vehicle contains cannabis. Every delivery team member must have a secure means of contacting personnel at the cultivation center, as well as the ability to contact emergency personnel. Each team member must also have his or her department-issue identification card at all times when transporting cannabis and must produce it upon request by the Department of Agriculture or law enforcement.
The requirements for adult-use cannabis transported by a licensed transporting organization are similar. Cannabis must be pre-packaged in a sealed cannabis container by the business shipping the cannabis. The transporting organization cannot open the container. The transporting organization must maintain a daily inventory of all cannabis that it transports, containing names of the agents and businesses shipping and receiving the cannabis and a notation of the traceable information located on the cannabis container, such as the type of cannabis and the weight. In addition to other safety and security requirements, all transportation vehicles must be equipped with a GPS tracking system that stores historic data for no less than 12 months. The Department is permitted to search all historic and real-time GPS data upon request. 

Dispensaries may not accept deliveries through public areas or areas where patrons may be. Deliveries must be accepted through a secure area unless otherwise approved by the IDFPR – Division of Professional Regulation.
Illinois Inspections Dispensaries and cultivation centers are subject to random and unannounced inspections and cannabis testing. They must also make all records, logs, and reports immediately available for inspection upon request by the IDFPR– Division of Professional Regulation or the Department of Agriculture, as applicable.
MARYLAND
The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (the “Maryland MCC”) grants medical cannabis grower, processor, dispensary and transportation licenses. A licensee may hold a license in each category to obtain vertical integration. The applicant must first seek pre-approval from the Maryland MCC to be granted a license. As part of the pre-approval application, the applicant must submit information related to its operations; safety and security; medical cannabis professionalism; retail management factors; business and economic factors; and other additional factors that may apply. Columbia Care’s 96%-owned subsidiary, Columbia Care MD LLC, received its final license in September 2019 to operate a dispensary.In November of 2022, Maryland voters adopted a ballot question (Question 4) amending the Maryland Constitution to legalize the adult use and possession of cannabis. Beginning on July 1, 2023, Question 4 allows adults age 21 or older in Maryland to possess and consume up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower, 12 grams of concentrated cannabis, or a total amount of cannabis products that does not exceed 750 mg THC. During the 2023 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly will consider legislation creating a regulatory framework for the adult use cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis. It is not known how this legislation will impact Columbia Care and its subsidiaries’ current medical cannabis operations, nor future authorization to operate in the adult use cannabis commercial marketplace.

 Notes:
(1)Columbia Care is operating the license under the terms of a management services agreement 
 Dispensary licenses in Maryland are renewed every six years. Before expiry, licensees are required to submit a renewal application. While renewals are granted every six years, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care MD LLC would expect to have its future anticipated license renewed in the ordinary course of business. While Columbia Care’s compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Maryland) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Maryland.
Maryland Licensing Requirements

In order to dispense medical cannabis, a licensed dispensary is required to comply with various dispensing requirements: (1) require presentment of a written certification from a qualifying patient or caregiver, (2) query the MMCC’s date network to verify that the patient is currently registered and has a certification from a provider, as well as the amount of medical cannabis that has already been dispensed pursuant to the written certification (3) dispense no more than a 30 day supply, (4) refuse to dispense medical cannabis if the patient or caregiver appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Registered patients and caregivers are required to provide attestations relating to their knowledge of the status of medical cannabis under Maryland and Federal law, as well as limitations on use of medical cannabis, such as keeping away from children and refraining from transfer to any other person.
Maryland Transportation
Only licensed medical cannabis growers, processors, or authorized secure transportation companies may transport business-to-business packages containing medical cannabis. Dispensaries are not authorized to pick up medical cannabis products from licensed growers or processors. Owners and employees of secure transportation companies must register as transportation agents with the Maryland MCC by undergoing criminal and financial background checks, and they must carry identification cards evidencing they hold current registration at all times while in possession of medical cannabis.

MASSACHUSETTS (MEDICAL)
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has authorized the cultivation, possession and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Massachusetts marijuana businesses. The Medical Use of Marijuana Program (the “MUMP”) registers qualifying patients, personal caregivers, Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (“MMTCs”), and MMTC agents. The MUMP was established by Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012, “An Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana”, following the passage of the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative, Ballot Question 3, in the 2012 general election. Additional statutory requirements governing the MUMP were enacted by the Legislature in 2017 and codified at G.L. c. 94I, et. seq. (the “Massachusetts Medical Act”). MMTC Certificates of Registration are vertically integrated licenses in that each MMTC Certificate of Registration entitles a license holder to one cultivation facility, one processing facility and one dispensary location. There is a limit of three (3) MMTC licenses per person/entity.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (“CCC”) regulations, 935 CMR 501.000 et seq. (“Massachusetts Medical Regulations”), provide a regulatory framework that requires MMTCs to cultivate, process, transport and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Patients with debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) when such diseases are debilitating, and other debilitating conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient’s healthcare provider. The CCC assumed control of the MUMP from the Department of Public Health on December 23, 2018.
Effective January 8, 2021, the CCC repealed certain regulations applicable to co-located medical and adult use facilities and incorporated them into the adult use regulations at 935 CMR 500.00 and the medical regulations at 935 CMR 501.000, as part of an overall update of both sets of regulations. The updated regulations also included the following significant changes:
•permitting Marijuana “Courier” Licensees to deliver directly to consumers from the premises of licensed marijuana retailer establishments and Marijuana Delivery Operators to purchase wholesale marijuana products directly from marijuana cultivation and product manufacturer establishments and deliver the products directly to consumers from the Delivery Operator’s warehouse location. Both Marijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator Licensees are reserved for at least 36 months for companies majority-owned and controlled by certain classes of certified Economic Empowerment or Social Equity applicants, for which Columbia Care does not quality; 
 •permitting Personal Caregivers to be registered to care for more than one – and up to five – Registered Qualifying Patients at one time; and 
 •permitting non-Massachusetts residents receiving end-of-life or palliative care or cancer treatment in Massachusetts to become Registered Qualifying Patients. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) follows the requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Upon the determination by the CCC that an MMTC applicant has met the above requirements in a satisfactory fashion, the MMTC applicant is required to pay the applicable registration fee and shall be issued a provisional license. Thereafter, the CCC shall review architectural plans for the building of the MMTC’s cultivation facility and/or dispensing facilities, and shall either approve, modify or deny the same. Once approved, the MMTC provisional license holder shall construct its facilities in conformance with the requirements of the Massachusetts Regulations. Once the CCC completes its inspections and issues approval for an MMTC of its facilities, the CCC shall issue a final license to the MMTC applicant. MMTC final licenses are valid for one year and shall be renewed by filing the required renewal application no later than sixty days prior to the expiration of the certificate of registration.

MASSACHUSETTS (ADULT-USE) 
Adult-use (recreational) marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The Cannabis Control Commission (the “CCC”), a regulatory body created in 2018, licenses adult use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (collectively, “Marijuana Establishments”) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018. In 2022, the Massachusetts Legislature amended the enabling legislation for the adult use program and MUMP to, among other things, render it unlawful for cannabis businesses to pay percentage-based fees to municipalities under the statutorily required Host Community Agreements with those municipalities.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) follows the requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
Existing MMTCs are given priority status over other applicants (except Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants) in applying for licensure as a Marijuana Establishment. However, the CCC has limited the scope of the priority applicant status to the functions and locations that the MTC currently operates. The same material application requirements exist for a Marijuana Establishment license as an MTC application; namely an application for an MTC license must include an Application of Intent, a Background Check, and a Management and Operations Profile including the content specified in the Massachusetts (Medical) section above.

The adult-use license application process commenced on April 1, 2018 for existing MMTC license holders, and on July 1, 2018 for all non-MMTC license holders. Existing MMTC license holders that timely applied for an adult-use license on or before April 1, 2018 are eligible to receive three adult-use licenses per medical MMTC license. Namely, one integrated MMTC medical license is eligible, if awarded by the CCC, to receive three adult-use licenses as follows: one for cultivation, one for processing, and one for dispensary. Additionally, there are 11 tiers of cultivator licenses ranging from a maximum of 5,000 square feet (Tier 1) to between 90,001 to 100,000 square feet of canopy (Tier 11).
Patriot Care Corp. applied for adult-use licenses for facilities in Lowell, Massachusetts and Greenfield, Massachusetts in May and June 2018. On September 6, 2018, the CCC approved provisional licenses for retail, manufacturing, and cultivation in Lowell, Massachusetts, and retail in Greenfield, Massachusetts. On January 25, 2019, the CCC approved and thereafter issued final marijuana establishment licenses for retail, manufacturing and cultivation of adult-use marijuana in Lowell and retail of adult-use marijuana in Greenfield.
The final licenses allow Patriot Care Corp. to operate the Marijuana Establishments. The licenses are listed in the table below.

CCC Inspections
The CCC or its agents may inspect a Marijuana Establishment and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice in order to determine compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All areas of a Marijuana Establishment, all Marijuana Establishment agents and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. Marijuana Establishments must immediately upon request make available to the Commission all information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, or an investigation of any incident or complaint. A Marijuana Establishment must make all reasonable efforts to facilitate the CCC’s inspection, or investigation of any incident or complaint, including the taking of samples, photographs, video or other recordings by the CCC or its agents, and to facilitate the CCC’s interviews of Marijuana Establishment agents. During an inspection, the CCC may direct a Marijuana Establishment to test marijuana for contaminants as specified by the CCC, including but not limited to mold, mildew, heavy metals, plant- growth regulators, and the presence of pesticides not approved for use on marijuana by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.
Moreover, the CCC is authorized to conduct a secret shopper program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
MISSOURI
Missouri Regulatory Landscape
Article XIV of the Missouri Constitution (“Article XIV”) provides that state-licensed physicians may recommend marijuana to patients for medical purposes and allows for the limited, regulated production, distribution, sale and purchase of marijuana for medical use. At a high level, Article XIV authorizes the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (“DHSS”) to promulgate rules for the proper regulation and control of the cultivation, manufacture, dispensing, and sale of marijuana for medical uses, including the licensure of entities authorized to undertake those activities, operational standards for those activities, taxation of retail sales of marijuana for medical use, and the registration of qualified patients. In Missouri, a qualified patient is one that suffers from cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, intractable migraines, a condition that causes severe and persistent pain, a debilitating psychiatric disorder, HIV/AIDs, a terminal illness, a chronic condition that normally requires a prescription medication that could be physically or psychologically addictive, or another chronic or debilitating condition as certified by a physician.
Pursuant to Article XIV, DHSS promulgated final rules governing the medical marijuana program in May 2019. Following promulgation of the rules, DHSS also undertook a process competitively to license entities in the areas of laboratory testing, cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and transportation in summer 2019. DHSS reported that it received approximately 2,270 applications for the various facility licenses, including 582 cultivation facility applications, 430 manufacturing facility applications, and 1,219 dispensary facility applications. Among these, DHSS issued 60 cultivation licenses, 86 manufacturing licenses, 192 dispensary licenses, and 10 laboratory testing licenses. These are the maximum number of licenses currently available under DHSS’s regulations, though the regulations state that DHSS may in the future determine that additional licenses should be issued to meet the demand for medical marijuana of qualifying patients.In November of 2022, Missouri voters approved a ballot referendum (Missouri Amendment 3), which amended the Missouri Constitution to legalize the purchase, possession, consumption, use, delivery, manufacture, and sale of marijuana for personal use for adults over the age of twenty-one and levy a six-percent tax rate on the sale of adult use marijuana. Beginning December 8, 2022, Missouri Amendment 3 authorizes Missouri residents to legally possess up to 3 ounces of

marijuana.DHSS adopted emergency regulations authorizing existing medical licensees to submit applications to convert to “Comprehensive Facilities,” which are defined as entities authorized to engage in adult use and medical operations. On December 8, 2022, DHSS began accepting applications for existing medical licensees to convert their medical licenses to Comprehensive Facility licenses. Columbia Care (thought its subsidiary) has applied for and received a Comprehensive Marijuana-Infused Products Manufacturing Facility License and a Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary Facility License. The first adult use cannabis sales to consumers in Missouri were authorized by DHSS and occurred on February 3, 2023.Under the emergency regulations, applications for conversion to Comprehensive Facilities must (i) be submitted in a department approved online format; (ii) include a plan that explains how the applicant will serve both the medical and adult-use markets, while maintaining adequate supply at a reasonable cost to qualifying patients; (iii) include a plan to promote and encourage participation in the regulated marijuana industry by people from communities that have been disproportionately impacted by marijuana prohibition; and (iv) include a nonrefundable $2,000 fee. DHSS has 60 days to act on these conversion applications.DHSS will not issue additional medical, adult use or comprehensive facility licenses until such time as DHSS determines additional licenses are needed to meet the demand for marijuana product and ensure a competitive market while also preventing an over-concentration of marijuana facilities within the boundaries of any particular local government.
 
Missouri Licenses
Columbia Care MO LLC holds the following licenses in Missouri:


Holding Entity | Permit/License | City | Expiration/RenewalDate (if applicable)(MM/DD/YY) | Description 
Columbia Care MO LLC | Marijuana License #MAN000036 | Columbia, MO | 01/10/2026 | Comprehensive Marijuana Manufacturer
Columbia Care MO LLC | Marijuana License #DIS000184 | Hermann, MO | 01/23/2026 | Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary 

 Missouri Regulations 
DHSS’s regulations, including the emergency regulations adopted by DHSS following passage of Missouri Amendment 3, establish both general requirements applicable to all licensed facilities, as well as specific requirements for various types of licenses, including manufacturing and dispensary licenses. 
All marijuana facilities are required to implement inventory control systems that utilize a DHSS-approved seed-to-sale tracking system for the tracking of marijuana products through the seed or immature plant stage through to sale to a qualified patient (or compliant disposal). Marijuana facilities are required to install and maintain security equipment designed to prevent unauthorized entrance, and include components of intrusion detection, electronic video monitoring, access limitation and control, and training of security personnel. Marijuana facilities are also required to maintain policies and procedures for addressing recalls, and proper labelling and packaging of products. In general, medical marijuana facilities are not permitted to be operated within 1,000 feet of schools or religious facilities. Wastes from marijuana facilities, such as solid wastes and wastewater, must be disposed of in accordance with otherwise-applicable Missouri law regarding waste disposal. Marijuana wastes are also required to be rendered unusable by mixture with non-marijuana wastes.
 Manufacturing facilities, in addition to complying with all otherwise-applicable requirements, are required to develop and maintain an odor mitigation plan, develop a protocol to ensure independent testing of products, plans for minimizing the risk of explosions and fires, and plans to transport medical marijuana to dispensaries in a manner that complies with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities that produce ingestible products are required to comply with all otherwise-applicable food safety standards under Missouri law.
Medical dispensary facilities, in addition to complying with all otherwise-applicable requirements, are required to maintain information accessible to qualified patients regarding such topics as addiction, different strains of medical marijuana and their effects, the risks of medical marijuana use, and prohibitions on consumption of medical marijuana in public places. Medical dispensary facilities are required to utilize point-of-sale systems that verify a qualified patient’s purchases through the statewide track and trace system, and that require verification of the qualified patient’s government-issued identification. A medical dispensary may not dispense medical marijuana in excess of what the qualified patient is permitted to purchase under the patient’s physician authorization. Medical dispensary facilities are required to limit access to qualifying patients and primary caregivers, and to enforce limited access

areas throughout the dispensary facility. 
With regard to adult use consumers, dispensary facilities must have only one entrance at which patients and/or consumers are screened to verify patient status and/or age. There are similar rules with regard to point of sale and statewide track and trace procedures for adult use transactions as there are for medical marijuana transactions.
NEW JERSEY
New Jersey Regulatory Landscape
New Jersey’s medical marijuana program is governed by the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act, N.J. Stat. § 24:6l-1 et seq. (the “Medical Cannabis Law”), and the implementing regulations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the “Commission”), N.J.A.C. 17:30A et seq. Pursuant to the Medical Cannabis Law, qualifying patients with debilitating medical conditions may become registered to use medical marijuana. Debilitating medical conditions include: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anxiety, cancer, chronic pain, dysmenorrhea, glaucoma, inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn’s disease, intractable skeletal spasticity, migraine, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, opioid use disorder, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired deficiency syndrome (AIDS), post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder including epilepsy, terminal illness with prognosis of less than 12 months to live, and Tourette’s syndrome. The Medical Cannabis Law creates a permitting regime for “alternative treatment centers” (“ATCs”), which are vertically-integrated medical marijuana businesses. In addition, the Commission’s regulations allow applicants for ATC permits to seek cultivation-, manufacturing-, or dispensing-specific licensure. Holders of an ATC license with a cultivation endorsement can possess, cultivate, plant, grow, harvest, and package usable marijuana; and can display, transfer, transport, distribute, supply, or sell marijuana to other ATCs, but not directly to registered qualifying patients. Holders of an ATC license with a manufacturing endorsement can possess and process usable marijuana; purchase usable marijuana from other ATCs possessing a cultivating endorsement; manufacture products containing marijuana approved by the Commission; conduct research and develop products containing marijuana for approval by the Commission; and can display, transfer, transport, distribute, supply, or sell marijuana and products containing marijuana to other ATCs, but not directly to registered qualifying patients. Finally, holders of an ATC license with a dispensary endorsement can purchase usable marijuana and products containing marijuana from other ATCs authorized to cultivate or manufacture usable marijuana or products containing marijuana; and can possess, display, supply, sell, and dispense, usable marijuana and/or products containing marijuana, to registered qualifying patients.
On July 2, 2019, New Jersey enacted the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act that made several changes to the state’s medical marijuana program. Amongst other changes, the NJ Act: (i) created the Commission, whereas the medical marijuana program was previously regulated by the New Jersey Department of Health, Division of Medicinal Marijuana (“DOH”); (ii) increases the monthly purchasing limit from two to three ounces of dry flower, and after 18 months allows the maximum to be adjusted by regulation; (iii) removes the purchasing limit for terminally ill and hospice patients; (iv) permits the sale of edible products; (v) phases out sales taxes on medical marijuana; (vi) provides reciprocity for patients registered with other state medical marijuana programs; (vii) authorizes home delivery to patients; and (viii) permitted ATCs to apply for up two additional satellite dispensing facilities, a right which expired as of January 2, 2021.
Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of New Jersey) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New Jersey for the medical marijuana program.
On February 22, 2021, the Governor of New Jersey signed into law an adult-use legalization bill entitled the “New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act,” which legalized personal use cannabis for certain adults, subject to State regulations (the “CREAMM Act”). The CREAMM Act provides ATCs specific expanded cultivation rights as well as the right to open up sales to the adult-use marketplace, subject to limited and specified conditions. As it relates to sales into the adult-use marketplace, the CREAMM Act permits ATCs to apply to the Commission for permission to operate as an Expanded ATC, i.e., servicing both the medical and adult-use marketplace, upon the demonstration of meeting the following two conditions:: (1) written approval to operate as an adult-use cannabis establishment from the municipality in which the ATC is located and compliance with said municipality’s local zoning restrictions; and (2) the ATC’s certification that it has sufficient quantities of medical cannabis and, if applicable, medical cannabis products, available to meet the reasonably anticipated needs of registered qualifying conditions. The CREAMM Act also permits ATCs to cultivate from up to two physical locations, provided that the ATC’s combined mature cannabis plant grow canopy between both locations does not exceed 150,000 square feet of bloom space. 
On August 19, 2021, the Commission approved the first set of rules governing the state’s adult-use cannabis program. The rules will allow the CRC to begin licensing cannabis businesses. On November 23, 2021, the Executive Director of the Commission issued guidance to ATCs on the process for submitting Expanded ATC applications, Columbia Care’s Expanded ATC application was approved by the Commission for its cultivation and manufacturing permits and two (2) retail dispensary locations in Vineland and Deptford on April 12, 2022, Columbia Care was approved to operate a second cultivation facility in Vineland on May 25, 2022, which

was also approved for Expanded ATC operations on August 3, 2022. Nine (9) other fully licensed and vertically integrated ATCs have been approved to become Expanded ATCs.
 
The Commission has also begun licensing other Expanded ATCs as well as adult-use only cultivators, manufacturers, and retailers. Adult-use only licenses are subject to an open and rolling application period that first commenced through a notice of application acceptance for personal-use cannabis business licenses in November of 2021. The Commission opened applications for Class 1 Cultivators and Class 2 Manufacturers on December 15, 2021, followed by applications for Class 5 Retailers on March 15, 2021. The Commission anticipates soliciting applications for Class 3 Wholesalers, Class 4 Distributors, and Class 6 Delivery licenses sometime in 2023. To date, the Commission has issued notice of application approval for forty-three (43) Class 5 Retailers, fifteen (15) Class 2 Manufacturers, and twenty-five (25) Class 1 Cultivators, though none of these stand-alone adult-use licenses have become fully licensed and operational. New adult-use award winners have three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date to the notice of approval to request a final onsite assessment and review from the Commission to become operational.
New Jersey Regulations ATC permits are awarded by a selection committee that evaluates applicants on the following general criteria: (1) submittal of mandatory organizational information; (2) ability to meet the overall health needs of qualified patients and safety of the public; (3) history of compliance with regulations and policies governing government-regulated marijuana programs; (4) ability and experience of applicant in ensuring an adequate supply of marijuana; (5) community support and participation; (6) ability to provide appropriate research data; (7) experience in cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing marijuana in compliance with government-regulated marijuana programs; and (8) workforce and job creation plan. Information required to be submitted is wide-ranging, and includes identification information and background checks of principals, employees, directors, and other stakeholders, and evidence of compliance with certain state and local laws and ordinances. Columbia Care was awarded a vertically integrated ATC permit as a result of the result of a 2018 Request for Applications (“2018 RFA”), along with five (5) other applicants selected for final approval for vertically integrated ATC permits by the DOH. The Commission has since approved an additional fourteen (14) ATC permits as part of the 2019 Request for Applications (“2019 RFA”), inclusive of four (4) additional vertically integrated permits, ten (10) stand-alone cultivation permits and thirty (30) stand-alone dispensary permits. 
In order for an ATC to become an Expanded ATC – selling into both the medical and adult-use market – it is required to certify to, among other things: (1) that the ATC has sufficient quantities of medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products available to meet reasonably anticipated needs of registered qualifying patients, including through inventory data, projections, and supporting materials; (2) that the ATC will not make operational changes that reduce access to medicinal cannabis for currently and newly registered qualifying patients in order to operate a cannabis establishment, including through the submission of a detailed plan for prioritizing and meeting the needs of registered qualifying patients.

 Permits expire annually on December 31 and require the submittal of a renewal application 60-days prior to the expiration of an ATC permit. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the permit, Columbia Care New Jersey would expect to receive a renewed permit in the ordinary course of business. 
Adult-use licenses expire a year after issuance and require the submittal of a renewal application 90-days prior to the expiration of such licenses. For Expanded ATCs in particular, the first renewal application must be accompanied by a certification as to the continued material accuracy of the Expanded ATC’s previously approved license application, submission of new written approval from the municipality in which the ATC is located, and the approval of all required renewal fees. Columbia Care New Jersey would expect to receive all requisite renewed adult-use licenses in the ordinary course.
New Jersey Dispensary Requirements
ATCs are subject to a number of regulations regarding their policies, procedures, records, and reporting, both under the medical and adult-use regulations. For example, ATCs must develop oversight procedures; procedures to ensure safe growing and dispensing operations; security policies; inventory protocols; disaster plans; pricing standards; and crime prevention plans and must maintain careful records, including organizational charts; facility documents; supply-and-demand projections; general business records; detailed sales records; and detailed personnel and training records. ATCs must provide substantial training for their employees and must maintain an alcohol and drug-free workplace. 
Holders of an ATC permit are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, point-of-sale systems, manufacturing standards, hours of operation, delivery, advertising and marketing, product labeling, records and reporting, age verification, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations (N.J.A.C. 17:30 et seq. and N.J.A.C. 17:30A) should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area.
New Jersey Storage, Security, and Transportation Requirements
Each ATC is required to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of cannabis including, when appropriate, systems to protect against electronic records tampering. With respect to security and inventory protocols, ATCs are required to maintain robust security and alarm systems in good working order; test and inspect such security systems; employ policies to limit unauthorized access to areas containing marijuana; adopt security protocols to protect personnel; minimize exterior access and ensure the exterior of the facility has adequate lighting; and notify the proper authorities of reportable losses, security breaches, alarm activations, and electrical failures. ATCs are required to conduct detailed monthly inventories and an annual comprehensive inventory.
Each ATC must install, maintain in good working order and operate a safety and security alarm system at its authorized physical address(es) that will provide suitable protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week against theft and diversion and that provides, at a minimum: (i) immediate automatic or electronic notification to alert state or local police agencies to an unauthorized breach of security at the alternative treatment center; and (ii) a backup system that activates immediately and automatically upon a loss of electrical support and that immediately issues either automatically or electronic notification to state or local police agencies of the loss of electrical support. ATCs must also implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and the theft of marijuana and security measures that protect the premises, registered qualifying patients, registered primary caregivers and principal officers, directors, board members and employees of the alternative treatment center. Each ATC must stablish a protocol for testing and maintenance of the security alarm system and conduct maintenance inspections and tests of the security alarm system at the ATC’s authorized location at intervals not to exceed 30 days from the previous inspection and test, and it must promptly implement all necessary repairs to ensure the proper operation of the alarm system. In the event of a failure of the security alarm system due to a loss of electrical support or mechanical malfunction that is expected to last longer than eight hours, an ATC must notify the Department and either provide alternative security measures or close the affected facilities until service is restored. Finally, each ATC must equip its interior and exterior premises with electronic monitoring, video cameras, and panic buttons.
Department Inspections
ATCs are subject to inspection by the Department at any time, with or without notice. ATCs must provide immediate access to all facilities, materials, and information requested by the Department. Failure to cooperate with an onsite assessment and or to provide the Department access to the premises or information may be grounds to revoke the permit of the ATC and to refer the matter to state law enforcement agencies. If a problem is discovered, the ATC must notify the Department in writing, with a postmark date that is within 20 business days of the date of the notice of violations, of the corrective actions the ATC has taken to correct the violations and the date of implementation of the corrective actions.
NEW YORK
New York Regulatory Landscape
In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (A06357E, S07923) (the “CCA”) to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program to meet the needs of New Yorkers. The program allows ten (10) registered organizations (“Registered Organizations”) to hold vertically integrated licenses and service qualified patients and caregivers. Limited product types are allowed in the state and smoking of cannabis flower is prohibited. The New York State Department of Health (“NYSDOH”) was the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program at that time. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of New York) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New York.
On March 31, 2021, New York became the 16th state to legalize the adult-use of marijuana with the enactment of Senate Bill S854A, also known as The Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act (the “MRTA”). Under MRTA, the current medical marijuana program is set to undergo several changes. A new Cannabis Control Board, and within it the Office of Cannabis Management (collectively as the “CCB”)—an independent agency operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authority—will be responsible for regulating the adult-use marijuana market as well as the existing medical marijuana and hemp cannabinoid programs Board. The list of medical conditions covered under the CCA will be widened to include additional qualifying conditions, medical patients will no longer be restricted from smoking medical marijuana, and the current limit on marijuana supply for medical patients will be doubled. Medical marijuana license holders may also be allowed to double their existing number of dispensaries for up to a total of eight dispensaries, but no more than three of the dispensary locations will be permitted to serve as adult-use marijuana retail stores. The legislation takes effect immediately, though full implementation will not occur until the Cannabis Control Board develops regulations for the adult-use marijuana program. It is currently expected that full implementation could take between 18 months to two years. 
The CCB published proposed adult-use regulations in the New York State Register on December 14, 2022, with a comment period that closed as of February 13, 2023 (the “Proposed Regulations”). Though the Proposed Regulations are subject to change, Registered Organizations are afforded the option of converting into one (1) of two (2) adult-use license types should they wish to convert to adult-use: (1) Registered Organizations Non-Dispensing (“ROND”), which is a hybrid-medical adult-use Registered Organization that is authorized to operate as an adult-use cultivator, processor, and distributor, but not converting any of its dispensing sites; or (2) Registered Organization with Dispensing (“ROD”), which is authorized to engage in adult-use cultivation, processing, distribution, and retail, but is only permitted to co-locate for medical and adult-use in three (3) of its four (4) dispensaries. The application to operate as either a ROND or ROD license must be accompanied by: (1) a community impact plan; (2) an energy and environmental plan; (3) a medical patient prioritization plan; and (4) a co-location retail dispensary operating plan if applying as a ROD. It is anticipated that the CCB will not begin accepting any applications for ROND or ROD until such time as the proposed regulations are made final. 
The CCB has been issuing three (3) types of conditional licenses until such time as full adult-use regulations are finalized, including: (1) adult-use conditional cultivators (“AUCC:”); (2) adult-use conditional processors (“AUCP”); and (3) conditional adult use retail dispensaries (“CAURD”). The eligibility for participation in the AUCC and AUCP programs is limited to those that previously held licenses in the hemp and/or hemp cannabinoid programs. Participation in the CAURD program is limited to those entities 51% owned by individuals with prior marijuana convictions, charges, and/or arrests. To date, the CCB has issued: (1) two hundred thirty-three (233) AUCCs; (2) thirty-one (31) AUCPs; and (3) sixty-six CAURD licenses.
 New York Licenses
Columbia Care NY LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Care, holds certificates of registration for manufacturing in Rochester, New York, and for dispensing in Riverhead, Brooklyn, New York (City), and Rochester, New York (collectively, the “New York Licenses”). Pursuant to the CCA and Medical Use of Marihuana Regulations (Title 10, Chapter XIII, Part 1004) by the NYSDOH, the New York Licenses collectively permit Columbia Care NY LLC to acquire, possess, manufacture, sell, transport, distribute, and dispense medical cannabis in the State of New York. The table lists the licenses issued to Columbia Care NY LLC in respect of its operations in New York.

During 2022, in conjunction with the proposed transaction with Cresco Labs, the Company reclassified certain licenses as held for sale in its New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois locations. Refer to Note 20 of the financial statements for additional details.
 The New York Licenses are renewed every two years. Before the two-year period ends, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by the NYSDOH. While renewals are granted every two years, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care NY LLC would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
New York Regulations
The New York Licenses permit the sale of medical cannabis products to any qualified patient who possess a physician’s recommendation. Under the terms of the New York Licenses, Columbia Care NY LLC is permitted to sell NYSDOH approved medical marijuana manufactured products to any qualified patient, provided that the patient presents a valid government-issued photo identification and NYSDOH-issued registry identification card proving the patient or designated caregiver meets the statutory conditions to be a qualified patient or designated caregiver. Registry identification cards are valid for one year after the date the certification is signed. The card contains the recommendation from the physician and the limitation on form or dosage of medical marijuana.
For a physician to recommend medical marijuana, the physician must pay for and pass a four-hour NYSDOH approved physician certification training program. The content of the course includes: “pharmacology of marijuana; contraindications; side effects; adverse reactions; overdose prevention; drug interactions; dosing; routes of administration; risks and benefits; warnings and precautions; abuse and dependence; and such other components as determined by the commissioner.” The CCB recently expanded this pool of recommending physicians by identifying that any practitioner who has a license to prescribe controlled substances may certify medical marijuana patients.
In order for a patient or registered caregiver to receive dispensed marijuana, they must be logged into the Prescription Monitoring Program (“PMP”) registry. The PMP registry is monitored by the NYSDOH and contains controlled substance prescription

dispensing history and medical marijuana dispensing history to ensure that patients only receive a maximum of 30-days-worth of dispensed product from one Registered Organization. Only registered pharmacists can dispense medical marijuana to approved patients and caregivers.
Allowable forms of medical marijuana in New York State are the following: flower, metered liquid or oil preparations, solid and semisolid preparations (e.g. capsules, chewable and effervescent tablets, lozenges), metered ground plant preparations and topical forms and transdermal patches.
Medical marijuana may not be incorporated into food products by the Registered Organization, unless approved by the CCB.
Qualifying conditions in the state of New York are the following: cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntington’s disease, certain types of severe debilitating pain, pain that degrades health and functional capability where medical marijuana is used as an opioid alternative, substance use disorder, or post- traumatic stress disorder. The severe debilitating or life-threatening condition must also be accompanied by one or more of the following associated or complicating conditions: cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain resulting in substantial limitation of function, severe nausea, seizures, severe or persistent muscle spasms, post- traumatic stress disorder, or opioid use disorder.
In the state of New York, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state can be sold in the state. New York is a vertically integrated system; however, it does allow Registered Organizations to wholesale manufactured product to one another. As such, Columbia Care NY LLC is vertically integrated and has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, transport, sell, and dispense cannabis products. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients, however the delivery plan must be pre-approved by the NYSDOH. Columbia Care NY LLC obtained approval for its delivery plan in February 2017 and utilizes its 70% owned subsidiary, CC Logistics Services LLC, to provide home delivery services throughout the state.

New York Dispensary Requirements
A qualified pharmacist must be present at a dispensary whenever medical marijuana products are being dispensed or handled. Dispensing facilities can only sell approved medical marijuana products, related products necessary for the approved forms of administration of medical marijuana, and items that promote health and well-being subject to disapproval of the department and only in such a manner as does not increase risks of diversion, theft or loss of approved medical marijuana products or risk physical, chemical or microbial contamination or deterioration of approved medical marijuana products.
No medical marijuana products may be consumed at a dispensary. Dispensaries must maintain patient confidentiality, including by keeping security footage secure. Dispensaries must affix a label to each medical marijuana product which (1) identifies the patient and caregiver (if any); (2) contains the name of the certifying practitioner, (3) identifies the dispensary name, address, and phone number; (4) provides the dosing and administration instructions; (5) gives the quantity and date dispensed; (6) lists any recommendation or limitation by the practitioner as to the use of medical marijuana; and (7) includes the expiration date of the product once opened. Each package must also include a safety insert approved by NYSDOH and/or CCB.
New York Reporting Requirements
The state of New York has selected BioTrackTHC’s solution as the state’s T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. The BioTrackTHC system is required to serve as all Registered Organizations’ patient verification system but is optional as the Registered Organization facing tracking system. Columbia Care NY LLC currently uses ADILAS Cannabis software as its inventory control system, and also uses BioTrackTHC on a limited basis. ADILAS is a robust system that enables users to track and generate inventory reports on demand with almost unlimited parameters and filters. While certain features of the system are available on the open market, Columbia Care’s proprietary modifications have optimized its functionality to respond to the unique requirements of a highly regulated medical marijuana program, such as New York’s.
Every month the CCB requests a dispensing report in Excel format, via email, showing the products dispensed for the month. This is the only report Columbia Care NY LLC is required to submit to the CCB. All other data is pulled by the CCB directly from Columbia Care NY LLC’s seed-to-sale tracking system.
New York Storage, Transportation and Security Requirements Registered Organizations must comply with a range of storage and security measures designed to ensure the safety and security of the cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products. Among other obligations, Registered Organizations are required to maintain a security operations plan that includes: an alarm system;

motion detectors; video cameras in areas that may contain marijuana; exportable video recordings that Columbia Care must retain for 60 days and make available to the CCB; measures to ensure adequate lighting; and other security measures. Registered Organizations must work to ensure that manufacturing and dispensing facilities maintain all security system equipment and recordings in a secure location with access limited to surveillance personnel, law enforcement, security system service employees, the CCB or its authorized representative, and others when approved by the CCB. Security equipment must be kept in working order and periodically tested.
Marijuana must be stored in a secure area accessible to a minimum number of employees to prevent diversion, theft, loss, and contamination or deterioration of the product. Approved safes, vaults or any other approved equipment or areas used for the manufacturing or storage of marijuana and approved medical marijuana products must be securely locked or protected from entry, except for the actual time required to remove or replace marijuana or approved medical marijuana products.
 Prior to transporting medical marijuana, Registered Organizations must complete a shipping manifest using a form determined by the CCB. A copy of the shipping manifest must be transmitted to the destination that will receive the products and to the CCB at least two Business Days prior to transport unless otherwise expressly approved by the CCB. In this regard, the Registered Organization must maintain shipping manifests and make them available to the CCB for inspection upon request, for a period of 5 years. Approved medical marijuana products must be transported in a locked storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana and in a storage compartment that is not visible from outside the vehicle. Employees, when transporting approved medical marijuana products, travel directly to their destination(s) and may not make unnecessary stops in between. Delivery times must be randomized, transportation vehicles must be staffed by at least two employees, and a copy of the shipping manifest must be on hand while transporting or delivering approved medical marijuana products.
 NYSDOH Inspections
All registered organizations must make their books, records, and facilities available to CCB for monitoring, on- site inspection, and audit purposes, including but not limited to periodic inspections and evaluations. If a problem is found by CCB, the registered organization must submit a plan of correction within 15 days.
New York Hemp
The CCB also has regulatory authority over New York’s industrial hemp program. That program creates a licensing regime for growers, processors, retailers, and of industrial hemp and hemp cannabinoid products, and subjects such licensees to recordkeeping, product-quality testing, transportation, disposal, and security requirements. The CCB has authority to inspect a registered premises as often and to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with hemp laws and regulations.
OHIO
Ohio Regulatory Landscape
House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program (“MMCP”) allows people with certain medical conditions, upon the recommendation of an Ohio- licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board, to purchase and use medical marijuana. House Bill 523 required that the framework for the MMCP would be in place no later than September 2018. This timeframe allowed for a deliberate process to ensure the safety of the public and to promote access to a safe product. Sales of medical marijuana in Ohio began in January 2019.
The following three state government agencies are responsible for the operation of the MMCP: (i) the Ohio Department of Commerce is responsible for overseeing medical marijuana cultivators, processors and testing laboratories; (ii) the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy is responsible for overseeing medical marijuana retail dispensaries, the registration of medical marijuana patients and caregivers, the approval of new forms of medical marijuana and coordinating the Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee; and (iii) the State Medical Board of Ohio is responsible for certifying physicians to recommend medical marijuana and may add to the list of qualifying conditions for which medical marijuana can be recommended. Qualifying medical conditions for medical marijuana include: HIV/AIDS, Lou Gehrig’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Cancer, Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, fibromyalgia, glaucoma, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), pain (either chronic, severe, or intractable), Parkinson’s disease, PTSD, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord disease or injury, Tourette’s syndrome, traumatic brain injury, ulcerative colitis. In order for a patient to be eligible to obtain medical marijuana, a physician must make the diagnosis of one of these conditions. The Board of Pharmacy is in the process of revising its regulations for dispensaries, for the forms and methods for administering medical marijuana, and for patients and caregivers.
 Several forms of medical marijuana are legal in Ohio, these include: inhalation of marijuana through a vaporizer (not direct smoking), oils, Tinctures, plant material, edibles, patches and any other forms approved by the State Board of Pharmacy. On November 18,

2021, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy closed its Request for Applications process to solicit applications for up to 73 new dispensary licenses. The Board of Pharmacy awarded these provisional dispensary licenses in early 2022. Also in 2022, the Board of Pharmacy amended its regulations to, among other things, add new requirements for renewals of dispensary key employee registrations and dispensary financial audits submitted to the Board. The Department of Commerce also amended its regulations in 2022 to, among other things, add new testing requirements and require patient caregivers to be Ohio residents. 
Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Ohio) follows the applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Ohio.

Cultivators must maintain their facilities according to certain standards. All floors and benches must be free of debris, dust, and any other potential contaminants. Cultivators must remove dead and unusable plant parts from the marijuana cultivation area, and control rodents and other non-plant related pests. In maintaining their facilities, cultivators may only use chemicals, cleaning solutions, and other sanitizing agents approved for use around vegetables, fruit, or medicinal plants and must store them in a manner that protects against contamination. Cultivators must keep their equipment in a clean, professional environment and maintain cleaning and equipment maintenance logs at their facilities. Scales, balances, or other weight and/or mass measuring devices must be routinely calibrated using “National Institute of Standards and Technology” (NIST)-traceable reference weights, at least once each calendar year, by an independent third party approved by the Department of Commerce. The water supply for each cultivation center must be derived from a source that is a regulated water system or a private water supply and must meet the needs of the cultivator. Each cultivator must implement policies and procedures related to receiving, inspecting, transporting, segregating, preparing, packaging, and storing medical marijuana in accordance with adequate sanitation principles. The disposal of undesired, excess, unauthorized, obsolete, adulterated, misbranded or deteriorated medical marijuana waste is subject to a specific set of procedures set forth in OAC 3796:2-2-03.
Cultivators may not sell marijuana to patients or caregivers, nor may they permit the consumption of marijuana on their premises.

A cultivator must not produce or maintain medical marijuana in excess of the quantity required for normal, efficient operation based on patient population and consumption reported in the inventory tracking system. A cultivator may not amend or otherwise change its approved operations plan, quality assurance plan, or cultivation or production techniques, unless written approval is obtained from the Department of Commerce, and a cultivator may not change the use or occupancy of the facility unless the Department of Commerce is notified of and provides prior written approval of such changes. A cultivator shall not sell plant material that exceeds thirty-five per cent THC content as defined in OAC 3796:1-1-01. Finally, a licensed cultivator may not directly or indirectly discriminate in price between different processor or dispensary facilities that are purchasing a like grade, strain, brand, quality, and quantity of medical marijuana.
 Dispensaries in Ohio may only dispense to qualified patients over the age of 18 or their caregiver. Each dispensary must use a scanner approved by the state board of pharmacy to retrieve patient registry data by scanning patient or caregiver registry identification cards and government issued photographic identification. Dispensaries may only be open between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm and must be open for a minimum of 35 hours per week. Dispensaries must have at least two employees in the dispensary during all hours of operation.
Dispensaries must maintain the following records: (a) confidential storage and retrieval of patient information or other medical cannabis records, (b) records of all medical cannabis received, dispensed, sold, destroyed, or used, (c) dispensary operating procedures, (d) a third-party vendor list, (e) monetary transactions, and (f) journals and ledgers. All records relating to the purchase or return, dispensing, distribution, destruction, and sale of medical cannabis must be maintained under appropriate supervision and control to restrict unauthorized access on the licensed premises for a five-year period.
Ohio Reporting Requirements
Ohio uses the METRC system as its seed-to-sale tracking system. Licensees are required to use METRC to push data to the state to meet all of the reporting requirements. Dispensaries must use METRC to provide data to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy on a real-time basis. The following data must be transmitted: (a) each transaction and each day’s beginning inventory, acquisitions, sales, disposal and ending inventory, (b) acquisitions of medical cannabis from a licensed processor or cultivator holding a plant-only processor designation, (c) name and license number of the licensed dispensary employee receiving the medical cannabis and, (d) other information deemed appropriate by the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy. A dispensary’s designated representative shall conduct the inventory at least once a week. Records of each day’s beginning inventory, acquisitions, sales, disposal and ending inventory shall be kept for a period of three years.
 Ohio Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements
The regulations permit Columbia Care OH LLC to store medical marijuana inventory at its cultivation facility in a designated, enclosed, locked facility identified in its plans and specifications that it submitted to the Ohio Department of Commerce. This storage area can only be accessible by authorized individuals. On an annual basis and as a condition to renewal of its cultivator license, Columbia Care OH LLC must perform a physical, manual inventory, of the medical marijuana on hand and compare it to the annual report generated by the inventory tracking system. The cultivation facility must install a commercial grade security alarm system to prevent and detect diversion, theft, or loss. The facility also must maintain surveillance equipment to capture the entire facility and

provide direct access to the regulator on a real-time basis. This equipment must be kept in good working order and inspected and tested on an annual basis by a third party.
Prior to transporting any medical marijuana, regardless of form, a medical marijuana entity must maintain a transportation log, in writing, that contains the following information: (1) the names and addresses of the medical marijuana entities sending and receiving the shipment; (2) the names and registration numbers of the registered employees transporting the medical marijuana or the products containing medical marijuana; (3) the license plate number and vehicle type that will transport the shipment; (4) the time of departure and estimated time of arrival; (5) the specific delivery route, which includes street names and distances; and (6) the total weight of the shipment and a description of each individual package that is part of the shipment, and the total number of individual packages. A copy of this log must be sent to the receiving entity before the close of business on the business day prior to transport. A copy of the log must also be in the vehicle at all times while it is transporting medical marijuana products. All such logs must be maintained and provided to law enforcement upon request.
Vehicles used to transport marijuana must be insured as required by law and staffed with a minimum of two registered employees, with at least one employee remaining with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains medical marijuana. The marijuana must be kept in a locked container or compartment, and it must not be visible from outside the vehicle. The vehicle must be unmarked. Any vehicle transporting medical marijuana or any product containing medical marijuana must travel directly from the sending medical marijuana entity to the receiving medical marijuana entity and shall not make any stops in between except to other medical marijuana entities listed on the transportation log, to refuel the vehicle, or to notify the medical marijuana entities, the department and law enforcement in the event of an emergency. In the event of an emergency, the employees must report the emergency immediately to law enforcement through the 911 emergency system and to the medical marijuana entities, which will immediately notify the appropriate regulatory authorities, unless the notification is impractical under the circumstances. The employees must notify the sending medical marijuana entity when the delivery has been completed.
 Dispensaries must restrict access areas and keep stock of medical cannabis in secured area enclosed by a physical barrier with suitable locks and an alarm system capable of detecting entry at a time when licensed dispensary employees are not present. Medical cannabis must be stored at appropriate temperatures and under appropriate conditions to help ensure that its identity, strength, quality and purity are not adversely affected.
 Additionally, dispensaries must have a security system that remains operational at all times and that uses commercial grade equipment to prevent and detect diversion, theft or loss of medical cannabis, including (a) a perimeter alarm, (b) motion detectors, and (c) duress and panic alarms. A dispensary must also employ a holdup alarm, which means a silent alarm signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a robbery in progress.
 Video cameras at a dispensary must be positioned at each point of egress and each point of sale. The cameras must capture the sale, the individuals and the computer monitors used for the sale. Video surveillance recording must operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Recording from all video cameras during hours of operation must be made available for immediate viewing by the Board of Pharmacy and must be maintained for at least six months.
 Department of Commerce Inspections
The Ohio Department of Commerce may, at any time it determines an inspection is needed, with or without notice, conduct an inspection of a cultivator to ensure compliance with the facility’s application and state laws and regulations. An inspection of a cultivator may include, without limitation, investigation of standards for safety from fire on behalf of the department by the local fire protection agency. If a local fire protection agency is not available, the division of state fire marshal may conduct the inspection after the cultivator pays the appropriate fee to the division of state fire marshal for such inspection. If a problem is detected during an inspection, the cultivator must produce a plan of correction within ten business days. Board of Pharmacy Inspections The Board of Pharmacy may conduct unannounced dispensary inspections and testing of medical marijuana samples. The Board enter dispensaries and conduct inspections of all areas and of all pertinent equipment, containers and materials and data.
PENNSYLVANIA
Pennsylvania Regulatory Landscape
The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one of 17 qualifying conditions, including epilepsy, chronic pain, and PTSD. The state, which consists of over 12

million U.S. citizens and qualifies as the fifth largest population in the US, operates as a high- barrier market with very limited market participation. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations).
On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would be initiated, which would include the issuance of 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. This application period ran from April 2018 through May 17, 2018. The Pennsylvania Department of Health announced the results of the application period, granting 23 new dispensary permits and 13 grower/processor permits across six regions of the state, on December 18, 2018.
In the introductory months of the program, Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana dispensaries experienced supply shortages that rendered the market unable to keep up with demand. It was announced on April 17, 2018 that dry flower would be included in the regulations as an approved product form for sale and consumption (in addition to the already approved forms of concentrates, pills, and tinctures). Simultaneously, it was announced that the list of qualifying conditions would expand from 17 to 21, including additions of cancer remission therapy and opioid-addiction therapy. In July of 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Health expanded the list of qualifying medical conditions to include anxiety disorders and Tourette syndrome, increasing the number of qualifying conditions to 23. 
On June 30, 2021, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law H.B. 1024 (also known as Act 44), which made revisions to Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program, including codification of certain practices permitted under emergency orders issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes permit a wider range of individuals to serve as caregivers, including employees of long-term care and nursing facilities. The changes also permit dispensaries some additional operational flexibilities, including providing limited, on-site outdoor order pickups, providing remote patient consultations, and providing medical dosages up to a 90 days' supply as opposed to a 30 days' supply.
On March 5, 2021, the Department of Health proposed permanent regulations relating to medical marijuana, replacing the temporary regulations governing the program through its history. These proposed regulations are in substantially the same form as the temporary regulations, with only a few distinctions. One proposed revision identifies that a medical marijuana organization’s change in ownership without the Department’s knowledge and written approval of all individuals affiliated with the medical marijuana organization would be a violation of the act and proposed rules. The proposed regulations also require dispensaries and grower/processors to supplement ongoing reports to the Department with information related to the average price per unit of medical marijuana products sold, as opposed to the per-dose price. The proposed rules also augment the list of reasons for which the Department may suspend or revoke a medical marijuana organization’s permit by adding falsification of information on any applications submitted to the Department. The proposed regulations also address training, identifying that principals, as well as employees, who have direct contact with patients or caregivers or who physically handle medical marijuana plants, seeds and products must also complete a training. Other changes include corresponding changes to caregiver and patient supply rules consistent with Act 44.Also consistent with Act 44 licensed Grower Processors in Pennsylvania may obtain hemp and hemp-derived CBD from hemp licensed in the state of Pennsylvania.The Department of Health promulgated final regulations that became effective March 4, 2023.
Additionally, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture administers an Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program, as permitted by the federal Industrial Hemp Research Act of 2016 (P.L. 822, No. 92). As it is allowed to do under the 2018 Farm Bill, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit a regulatory plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture program to administer a larger Industrial Hemp Program, including licensing the cultivation of hemp, as defined by federal law, for interstate commercial purposes. In January of 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture lifted its 100-acre acreage cap on permitted hemp cultivators to grow unlimited acreage on locations approved under pre-existing permits. 
Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Pennsylvania) follows applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania Licenses
Under applicable laws, the license permits Columbia Care to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, and to sell marijuana and marijuana products to registered patients pursuant to the terms of the license. The license is issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (the “Department”) under the provisions of the Medical Marijuana Act (35 P.S. §§ 10231.101—10231.2110) and Chapters 1141, 1151 and 1161 of the Pennsylvania regulations. The license is, as of the date hereof, active with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
All dispensaries must register with the Department. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email and include a renewal form. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely

manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.

Green LeafMedicals, LLC | Permit GP-18-3005 | Saxton, PA | 07/31/2023 | Grower Processor

 Pennsylvania Dispensary Requirements In order to maintain its permit, a dispensary must continue to meet all of the qualifications for obtaining such permit. Dispensaries must purchase marijuana only from authorized growers and processors. They may sell devices related to the use of medical marijuana, but only with the Department’s prior written approval. Dispensaries must require a valid identification card from each patient or caregiver and verify it via electronic tracking system before dispensing any product. A dispensary may not dispense (1) a quantity of marijuana greater than the amount indicated on a patient’s certification, (2) a form or dosage of product that is listed as a restriction or limitation on the patient certification, (3) or a form of medical marijuana product which is not permitted by law or regulation. Dispensaries cannot dispense more than a 90-day supply at one time, and subject to additional requirements in the Department of Health’s final regulations. Moreover, dispensaries are subject to certain advertising and promotional restrictions.
Dispensaries must maintain their facilities in sanitary condition. Generally, employees working in direct contact with medical marijuana products must comply with the food-handling regulations of Pennsylvania. Employees and visitors must have access to adequate hand-washing facilities and sanitary lavatories.
Dispensaries may not employ individuals under the age of eighteen. A dispensary may not permit a patient to self- administer medical marijuana products at the facility unless the patient is also an employee of the dispensary, and the dispensary permits self-administration of medical marijuana products at the facility by the employees.
Pennsylvania Reporting Requirements
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uses MJ Freeway as the state’s computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees are required to use MJ Freeway to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC integrates its in-house software with the state’s MJ Freeway program to capture the data points required by the Pennsylvania medical marijuana laws and regulations.
Pennsylvania Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements
The regulations require a dispensary to have a locked limited access area for the storage of medical marijuana that is expired, damaged, deteriorated, mislabeled, contaminated, recalled or whose containers or packages have been opened or breached until such product is returned to the grower/processor.
Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC must have a security system with professional monitoring, 24-hours a day and seven days a week, and fixed cameras on the interior and exterior of the facilities. The surveillance system must store data for a period of four years in a readily available format for investigative purposes.
Unless otherwise approved by the Department, a dispensary may deliver medical marijuana products to a medical marijuana organization only between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. for the purposes of transporting medical marijuana products among the permittee’s dispensary locations and returning medical marijuana products to a grower/processor. Dispensaries may not transport medical marijuana products outside of Pennsylvania, and they must use a global positioning system to ensure safe, efficient delivery of the medical marijuana products to a medical marijuana organization. Dispensaries may not offer delivery of medical marijuana. Dispensaries must have an enclosed, secure area out of public sight for the loading and unloading of medical marijuana products into and from a transport vehicle.
All vehicles used in the transport of marijuana must be unmarked and equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area. Products must be appropriately packaged and labeled. If transporting perishable medical marijuana products, they must be temperature controlled. They must display current inspection stickers and be insured for a commercially reasonable amount. Each vehicle must be staffed with at least two people while transporting marijuana, with at least one team member remaining in the vehicle at all times. Each team member must have access to a secure form of communication with the dispensary and have a valid driver’s license. Team

members must not wear clothing or symbols related to marijuana, and they must carry an identification badge or card at all times and produce it to law enforcement upon request. The team must also carry a transportation manifest and provide a copy to the recipient of the medical marijuana products.
Department Inspections
The Department may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the medical marijuana organization’s compliance with its permit and all relevant laws and regulations. Such inspection or investigation may include (1) inspection of a medical marijuana organization’s site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information; (2) questioning of employees, principals, operators, financial backers, authorized agents of, and any other person or entity providing services to the medical marijuana organization; and (3) inspection of a grower/processor facility’s equipment, instruments, tools and machinery that are used to grow, process and package medical marijuana, including containers and labels. Failure to provide immediate access to any of the materials, information, or individuals listed above may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, suspension or revocation of the medical marijuana organization’s permit, or an immediate cessation of its operations pursuant to a cease-and-desist order issued by the Department.
UTAH
Utah Regulatory Landscape
On December 3, 2018, Utah lawmakers passed House Bill 3001: Utah Medical Cannabis Act (the “UT Act”). The Utah Act directs the Utah Department of Health (the “Utah Department”) to issue medical cannabis cards to patients, register medical providers who wish to recommend medical cannabis treatment for their patients, and license medical cannabis pharmacies. Covered medical conditions include HIV/AIDS, ALS, cancer, cachexia, persistent nausea, Chron’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, PTSD that is being treated and monitored by a licensed therapist, autism, certain terminal illnesses, and certain other rare conditions and diseases. The Act and subsequent amendments thereto authorized the Department to license and regulate up to 14 private entities to dispense medical cannabis products through medical cannabis pharmacies. The Utah Department has issued regulations governing medical cannabis pharmacies’ operations. The UT Act also grants the Department of Agriculture and Food regulatory authority over medical marijuana cultivators and processors. Effective July 1, 2021, all Utah medical cannabis cardholders are required to purchase their products from a Utah medical cannabis pharmacy. Out of state purchases and possession of medical cannabis are no longer permitted.
On January 3, 2020, the Department announced its intent to award 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses to companies selected from over 130 applicants. Columbia Care was selected to open a medical cannabis pharmacy in Springville, Utah, which is located just south of Provo. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Utah) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Utah. Additionally, Utah law required the 15th pharmacy license to be given to a business located in specific rural counties. On November 18, 2021, the Department awarded the state’s 15th medical cannabis pharmacy license to an existing Utah medical cannabis pharmacy operator that will open its facility in Price, Utah. 
On February 28, 2020, the Governor signed legislation comprehensively amending the UT Act. Among the changes were the allowance of dosages in liquid suspension, allowance of medical cannabis pharmacies to sell certain CBD products, creation of partial-year limited licenses for cannabis processing licensing facilities and operation of an independent testing laboratory by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (“UDAF”), expansion of the authority of the state’s Cannabinoid Product Board to review scientific research on the efficacy of products, and the state’s Compassionate Use Board to hear petitions for use, relaxation of certain patient limits on use and validity of medical cannabis cards and restrictions on medical providers, direction to the Department of Health to authorize out-of-state residents to purchase medical cannabis, and permission to the UDAF to conduct random sampling of medical cannabis in medical cannabis pharmacies. 
On March 24, 2022, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed into law Senate Bill 195, which makes several changes to the medical marijuana program. These changes include the addition of acute pain for which a medical professional may generally provide opioids as a qualifying condition eligible for a limited supply of medical cannabis and amends requirements for medical cannabis advertising and renewing patient medical cannabis cards.
Additionally, in 2014, the Utah legislature passed the Hemp and Cannabinoid Act (the “UT Hemp Act”) pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill, which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in Utah. The UT Hemp Act created a pilot program for hemp. Utah’s 2019 amendments to the UT Hemp Act expanded the scope of the state’s hemp program. In 2020, Utah amended the UT Hemp Act once again and directed the UDAF to develop a state industrial hemp production plan. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Utah Industrial Hemp Production Plan.
Under the UT Hemp Act, an individual or entity cultivating or processing industrial hemp must obtain an industrial hemp producer license. The industrial hemp production plan subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include grower area requirements and reporting requirements; submission to inspection, sampling, and testing by UDAF to ensure the hemp has a

permissible THC level of under 0.3%; storage requirements; and destruction processes. Intentional violations of the UT Hemp Act or UDAF’s rules, as well as repeated negligent violations, may result in loss of license.
Utah License Requirements
The Department announced its plans to award the 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses across four regions of the state. Columbia Care applied for a license in Region 3, which encompasses Utah County, where Springville is situated. The application process required Columbia Care to pay an application fee and to submit information regarding its ownership and directors, its finances, and a description of any past disciplinary actions for cannabis-related operations in any jurisdiction. Columbia Care was also required to submit highly detailed information regarding its experience, operating plan, strategic plan, local connections, and ability to keep the cost of medical cannabis low for patients. Such information included, for example: a list of all states in which Columbia Care operates; details of Columbia Care’s proposed facility; a floor plan depicting the facility’s security features; information about principles and key employees’ credentials, including a Utah licensed pharmacist; training and customer service information; storage protocols; a description of all medical cannabis products Columbia Care intends to offer; a financial plan; and Columbia Care’s local connections to Utah.
License applications were then evaluated and scored by a committee based on several criteria, including: experience in the medical cannabis or other highly regulated industries, disciplinary action or investigation in other jurisdictions, an operating plan that will best ensure the safety and security of cardholders and the community, the extent to which an applicant can reduce the cost of medical cannabis, connections to the local community, and a strategic plan that has a high likelihood of success. Of the 14 licenses awarded by the Department, an initial group of eight pharmacies were given the option to open as soon as March 1, 2020, while the remaining six are allowed to open as early as July 1, 2020. Successful applicants were required to obtain a land-use permit for their medical cannabis pharmacy within 120 days of the license award if required by their county or locality. Final licensure is also subject to applicants’ owners passing criminal background checks and the Department approval of the applicants’ operating plans. Columbia Care satisfied these requirements and was issued a medical cannabis pharmacy license on April 22, 2021 authorizing Columbia Care to operate the pharmacy.
UDAF licenses medical cannabis processors and regulates the manufacturing and processing of medical cannabis into various medical cannabis products. Processors in Utah are responsible for dry, cure, extraction, refinement, formulation, packaging, and labeling of medical cannabis products. Utah has two tiers of processing licenses. A Tier 1 Processing License allows a facility to process, formulate, package, and label products. A Tier 2 License allows a facility to packaging and labeling or products. Currently UDAF is not restricting the number of either tier of processing licenses.
Columbia Care applied for a Tier 1 processing license. The processing license application process required Columbia Care to pay an application fee and to submit information regarding its ownership and directors, its finances, a description of any past disciplinary actions for cannabis-related operations in any jurisdiction and detailed property information, including, but not limited to facility square footage, type and location of equipment, and the location of all cameras and external lights. Columbia Care was also required to submit highly detailed information regarding its experience, and operating plan, Such information included, for example: a list of all products that will be produced; all extraction methods to be used, including solvents, chemicals and equipment; short and long-term storage protocols to ensure sanitary preservation of medical cannabis products; a recall plan; a disposal plan; and transportation and transfer plan, including the make and model of all vehicles Columbia Care will use to transport medical cannabis products. All Medical Cannabis Processing Facilities must comply with quality assurance testing, and obtain a Good Manufacturing Permit from UDAF’s Regulatory Services. Final licensure is also subject to the payment of a $100,000.00 processing fee, securing a $50,000.00 performance bond, and successful completion of a pre-inspection to verify the processing facility meets all safety and security requirements. Columbia Care expects to satisfy these requirements in the ordinary course of business.
Utah Operating Requirements
Medical cannabis pharmacies in Utah are subject to several highly detailed operational requirements. The requirements impose restrictions on who may enter a pharmacy, who may be employed by a pharmacy, and on consuming cannabis on site. They require pharmacies to maintain sophisticated security infrastructure and policies designed to minimize the risk of diversion and to minimize access to cannabis products. These include, for example, maintenance of a physical surveillance system with video cameras located throughout the facility, a fail-safe backup system to support the system in the event of a power-outage; installation of an alarm system; and maintenance of safes and vaults for storing medical cannabis.
The operational requirements also govern the dispensing procedure. All cannabis sold must meet certain labeling requirements and transactions are subject to a number of verification, inventory, and record-keeping requirements. Unusable cannabis products must be properly disposed. The UT Act imposes limitations on the amount of cannabis a pharmacy can dispense to a single patient in a 28-day period. That amount is capped at the lesser of (a) a 30-day supply for treatment; (b) 113 grams of unprocessed cannabis; or (c) 20 grams of total composite THC. Utah law also allows pharmacies to dispense medical cannabis via home delivery.

Medical cannabis pharmacies are required to employ a pharmacist-in-charge (“PIC”). The duties of the PIC generally include ensuring: the safe, informed, and appropriate distribution of medical cannabis and cannabis devices; protection, recording, and maintenance of patient records; education and training of pharmacy personnel; procurement of cannabis products and educational materials; appropriate disposal and storage of cannabis; controls against theft or diversion; compliance with applicable laws and regulations; quality assurance; maintenance of the point-of-sale system and integration with the state’s inventory systems; and safe operation of the facility. Pharmacies must also be supervised by at least one licensed medical cannabis pharmacy medical provider (“PMP”) who must be present during all hours of operation.

VIRGINIA
Virginia Regulatory Landscape
In 2017, Virginia commenced a program to allow registered patients to use CBD oil or THC-A oil. The program is governed by Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-3442.5 et seq., and by emergency regulations enacted by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy (the “Virginia Board”) at 18 VAC 110-60-10 et seq. “Registered patients” means any Virginia resident who has received a written certification for the use of CBD oil or THC-A oil from a practitioner (which includes nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to alleviate the symptoms of any diagnosed condition or disease, and who has been issued a registration by the Virginia Board. Virginia’s program allows the Virginia Board to license “pharmaceutical processors,” which are vertically integrated operations that can cultivate, process, and dispense CBD oil and THC-A oil in concentrations to be established by the Virginia Board that cannot exceed 10 mg of THC per dose. The oils can be processed into other formulations, such as capsules or lozenges. The state has limited licensure to one pharmaceutical process per “health service area,” as defined by the State Board of Health. There are currently five health service areas. Following an initial cultivation period, pharmaceutical processors cannot maintain more than 12 cannabis plants per patient and cannot maintain CBD oil or THC-A oil in excess of what is required for normal operations.
In 2020, Virginia passed an act amending and reenacting Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-408.3 and 54.1-3442.5 et. seq (the “Amendment”). The Amendment allows for cannabis dispensing facilities, allows patients who are temporary residents to register, permits access to cultivation areas of the processor without a pharmacist on site, permits the Board to establish standards for testing laboratories to obtain controlled substance registration, permits the sale of devices and inert sample products, allows wholesale distribution between processors and dispensing facilities, changes every reference of “cannabidiol oil or THC-A oil” to “cannabis oil,” deletes the requirement for an in-person examination by the prescriber certifying a patient to receive cannabis oil and allow the use of telemedicine in compliance with federal law, allows the pharmacist-in-charge to authorize certain employees to access secured areas when a pharmacist is not on site, and allows a ratio of six pharmacy technicians per one pharmacist working in the processor.
In 2020, the Virginia Board amended Title 18 of the Virginia Administrative Code 110-60, et. seq. and in February 2021, the Virginia Board adopted emergency rules amending Title 18 of the Virginia Administrative Code 110-60, et. seq. effective February 8, 2021 through August 7, 2022. These rules and emergency rules implement the changes as laid out in the Amendment. “Cannabis dispensing facility” means a facility that (i) has obtained a permit from the Board pursuant to § 54.1-3442.6; (ii) is owned, at least in part, by a pharmaceutical processor; and (iii) dispenses cannabis oil produced by a pharmaceutical processor to a registered patient, his registered agent, or, if such patient is a minor or an incapacitated adult as defined in § 18.2-369, such patient’s parent or legal

guardian. “Temporarily resides” means a person that does not maintain a principal place of residence within Virginia but resides in Virginia on a temporary basis as evidenced by documentation substantiating such temporary residence.
On April 7, 2021, a majority of both houses of the Virginia legislature voted to legalize adult-use marijuana. Virginia Senate Bill 1406/House Bill 2312 legalizes the retail sale of marijuana products to adults over the age of 21 and establishes the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority to oversee the cultivation, manufacture, wholesale, and retail sale of marijuana and marijuana products. Under the new law, home cultivation and personal possession of marijuana became legal July 1, 2021, but retail sales will not begin until January 1, 2024. In 2022 and 2023, the Virginia General Assembly passed and Governor Glenn Youngkin signed into law a series of statutory amendments to the adult use cannabis legislation and affecting the medical cannabis program. Among other things, the amendments transfer oversight and administration of the medical cannabis program from the Board of Pharmacy to the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority, establish new restrictions on advertising, with criminal penalties for violations,, allows pharmacists employed by pharmaceutical processors to issue written certifications subject to oversight by the processor’s medical director and under other conditions, adds labeling requirements, and recriminalizes possession of more than four (4) ounces of cannabis in public. 
Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the Commonwealth of Virginia) follows the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Virginia License Requirements
The pharmaceutical processor permit application process includes three stages: initial application, awarding of conditional approval, and granting of a permit. In the first stage, the applicant must submit an application fee and an application that includes: identifying information regarding the applicant and its owners; the location within the health service area that is to be operated under such permit; financial information to demonstrate its capacity to build and operate a facility; a detailed security plan; documents establishing the applicant’s ability to conduct business in Virginia and its compliance with applicable ordinances and codes; information necessary for the Virginia Board to conduct criminal background checks; information about any previous or current involvement in the medical CBD oil or THC-A oil industry; information about any prior applications for medical CBD oil or THC-A oil licensure in any state; business or marketing plans; text and graphic materials showing the exterior appearance of the proposed facility; building documents including a detailed blueprint; documents related to any compassionate need program the pharmaceutical processor intends to offer; information about the applicant’s expertise in agriculture and other production techniques required to produce CBD oil or THC-A oil and to safely dispense such products; and other documents required by the Virginia Board. As part of the initial application process, the Virginia Board conducts criminal background checks on applicants.
Following the deadline for receipt of applications, the Virginia Board evaluates each complete and timely submitted application and may grant conditional approval based on the following criteria: the results of the criminal background checks or any history of disciplinary action imposed by a state or federal regulatory agency; the location for the proposed pharmaceutical processor, which shall not be within 1,000 feet of a school or daycare; the applicant’s ability to maintain adequate control against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis; the applicant’s ability to maintain the knowledge, understanding, judgment, procedures, security controls, and ethics to ensure optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of CBD oil or THC-A oil; the extent to which the applicant or any of its the applicant’s pharmaceutical processor owners have a financial interest in another license, permit, registrant, or applicant; and any other reason provided by state or federal statute or regulation that is not inconsistent with the law and regulations regarding pharmaceutical processors. The Virginia Board may disqualify any applicant who submits an incomplete, false, inaccurate, or misleading application; fails to submit an application by the published deadline; fails to pay all applicable fees; or fails to comply with all requirements for a pharmaceutical processor.
Following review, the Virginia Board notifies applicants of denial or conditional approval. If granted conditional approval, an applicant has one year to complete all requirements for issuance of a permit to include employment of a Pharmacist-in-Charge (“PIC”) and other personnel necessary for operation of a pharmaceutical processor, the construction or remodeling of a facility, installation of equipment, and securing local zoning approval.
When the Virginia Board’s requirements have been met – including designation of a PIC, completion of background checks, employment of an electronic tracking system, and an inspection of the facility – the Virginia Board may grant a pharmaceutical processor permit. If an inspection reveals any deficiencies, they must be corrected, and a reinspection may be performed before the permit is issued. The applicant must also attest to compliance with state and local laws and ordinances.
If an applicant has been awarded a pharmaceutical processor permit and has not commenced operation of such facility within 180 days of being notified of the issuance of a pharmaceutical processor permit, the Virginia Board may rescind the permit, unless such delay was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the permit holder. If a permit is so rescinded, the Virginia Board may award a

pharmaceutical processor permit to another qualified applicant. Once the permit is issued, cannabis may not be grown or held in the pharmaceutical processor earlier than two weeks prior to the opening date designated on the application. Once cannabis has been placed in the pharmaceutical processor, a pharmacist shall be present during hours of operation to ensure the safety, security, and integrity of the cannabis. If there is a change in the designated opening date, the pharmaceutical processor shall notify the Virginia Board, and a pharmacist shall continue to be on site on a daily basis.
The Virginia Board may issue up to five cannabis dispensing facility permits in each health service area. A permit may be issued to a facility that is owned, at least in part, by the pharmaceutical processor located in that health service area for dispensing cannabis oil that has been cultivated and produced on the premises of the processor. Each dispensing facility shall be located within the same health service area as the pharmaceutical processor.
Applicants must submit an application and fee for each cannabis dispensing facility. The submission must also include (i) the name and address of the facility, (ii) the name and address of the facility’s owners with 5% or greater ownership, (iii) the name and signature of pharmacist-in-charge, (iv) details regarding the security plan and plan to prevent diversion, (v) information for the Virginia Board to conduct a background check, and (vi) the requisite fee.
The Virginia Board will conduct an inspection of the facility prior to issuing a permit. The permit shall not be awarded until any deficiency with the facility has been corrected and the facility has been satisfactorily inspected. The cannabis dispensing facility must be operational within 90 days of the date the permit is issued or the Virginia Board will either rescind or extend the permit.
Virginia Operating Requirements
Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are required to designate a PIC to manage its operation, and to have a supervising pharmacist on duty during its hours of operation. The PIC of a pharmaceutical processor may authorize certain employees’ access to secured areas designated for cultivation even when the pharmacist is not on the premises. Numerous tasks involving the handling of CBD oil or THC-A oil must be performed by a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician acting under a pharmacist’s supervision. Those tasks include, for example, labeling oils, removing oils from inventory, measuring oils for dispensing, and selling oils. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians must have current licenses, and the ratio of pharmacists to pharmacy technicians cannot exceed 4-to-1. The Virginia Board has also imposed certain educational requirements for the cultivation of cannabis plants and the extraction of oils. And, the Virginia Board requires significant employee training, both upon initial employment and continuously thereafter.
A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must operate for a minimum of 35 hours per week. Access to a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility is limited to employees performing their job duties (who must display ID badges) and patients (and their parents or guardians). It must sell oils in a child-resistant container (with some exceptions). Pharmacists must counsel registered patients, parents, and legal guardians regarding the use of CBD oil or THC-A oil, including information related proper use and storage.
Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are subject to advertising restrictions; cannot sell products aside from CBD oil or THC-A oil; cannot cultivate, produce, or dispense oils anywhere except its designated facility; and cannot provide samples. Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities may wholesale products to other pharmaceutical processors and may transport wholesale products to other pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities. A pharmaceutical processor wholesale distributing products must create a record of the transaction and provide the receiver of the products with a copy of the lab results for the product. They may also deliver CBD or THC-A oil to a registered patient in accordance with certain regulatory requirements.
The cultivation and dispensing processes are subject to numerous Virginia Board requirements. For cultivation: pesticides are prohibited (with some exception); oil extraction methods must meet industry standards; products must be branded, tested, and registered with the Virginia Board before they are dispensed; products must be labeled to disclose certain product identifying information; and samples from batches must be made available to independent laboratories for testing prior to sale. For dispensing: the pharmacist or pharmacy technician must view the patient’s ID before filling any portion of the patient’s prescription; the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must maintain detailed dispensing records for three years; and the processor or dispensing must implement and comply with a quality assurance program, meeting several requirements, to prevent dispensing errors. Finally, unused cannabis and its oils must be disposed of in a manner that makes the cannabis and its oils unrecoverable.
As of March 2023, the Board allows pharmaceutical processors to sell whole flower to patients.

Virginia Licenses
On September 25, 2018, the Virginia Board announced the conditional approval of pharmaceutical processor permits for each of Virginia’s five health service areas. Columbia Care Eastern Virginia LLC was awarded conditional approval for Health Services Area V and was granted a final permit to operate a facility in that area on April 6, 2020.

 Virginia Security, Transportation, and Storage Requirements
Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are subject to a number of inventory and security requirements. They must conduct an initial comprehensive inventory; establish ongoing inventory controls and procedures; conduct the requisite inventory reviewed (weekly inventory reviews for pharmaceutical processors and perpetual inventory for cannabis dispensing facilities); and prepare an annual inventory report. Inventory records must be made available to the Virginia Board and its agents. All parts of the cannabis plant and its oils must be stored in a locked and secured vault or safe with appropriate access limitations, and the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must maintain a sophisticated security system meeting certain Virginia Board criteria. Storage of cannabis and its oils must generally be clean, sanitary, safe, and subject to a number of conditions. The pharmaceutical processor’s or cannabis dispensing facility’s video system must cover areas where cannabis or its oils are handled. Recordings must be stored for 30 days and made available for the Virginia Board’s immediate review upon request. Security events must be reported to the Virginia Board. Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities may not transport cannabis or its oils to any other facility, except for the wholesale purposes specified above.
Virginia Board Inspections
At all times, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians at the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must have their current license or registration available for inspection by the Virginia Board or its agents.
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Washington, D.C. Regulatory Landscape 
Washington, D.C.’s medical cannabis program is governed by D.C. Code § 7-1671.01 et seq. and the implementing regulations, CDCR 22-C100 et seq. The program authorizes all registered, qualified patients and caregivers to purchase medical cannabis from any licensed dispensary in the District. Registrations cards for District residents are valid for two years from the date of issuance. The program also authorizes medical cannabis cardholders from other states to purchase medical cannabis from any licensed dispensary in the District. The program accepts medical cannabis cards from any state or U.S. territory that has an active medical cannabis program and issues either a card or state-issued document evidencing the patient’s participation in the program as long as that state or territory extends reciprocity to the District. The program also allows non-District residents to apply for a 30-day temporary registration.
The medical cannabis program creates licensing regimes for dispensaries and cultivation centers. A dispensary registered to operate in the District of Columbia may (a) possess and sell medical cannabis to registered qualified patients and caregivers; and (b) manufacture, purchase, possess, and distribute paraphernalia and cigarette rolling papers to registered qualified patients and

caregivers. All medical cannabis sold by a licensed dispensary must be provided by a District-licensed and located medical cannabis cultivator. A cultivation center registered to operate in the District of Columbia may: (a) possess, manufacture, grow, cultivate, and distribute medical cannabis for sale to registered dispensaries; and (b) manufacture, purchase, possess, and distribute paraphernalia and cigarette rolling papers to registered dispensaries. The number of dispensaries in the District of Columbia is capped at 8, while the number of cultivation centers is capped at 14. Currently, there are seven operating dispensaries and six operating cultivation centers. An application processes for an additional dispensary license, two additional cultivation centers, and two testing laboratories was completed on September 28, 2022.

On January 30, 2023, the Mayor of Washington, D.C. signed the Medical Cannabis Amendment Act of 2022 that includes substantial changes to the medical cannabis program, including removing the caps on licenses, establishing a process for unlicensed establishment to obtain a medical cannabis business license, creating new license categories and endorsement, allowing qualifying patients to self-certify and creating a civil enforcement mechanism for businesses distributing or selling cannabis without a license. The Act is currently being reviewed by Congress. According to the D.C. City Council, the “Projected Law Date is Mar 28, 2023” unless Congress passes a Resolution of Disapproval.
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in Washington, D.C.) follows the regulatory framework enacted by Washington, D.C.

WEST VIRGINIA (HEMP)
In 2002, the West Virginia Legislature passed the Industrial Hemp Development Act (the “WV Hemp Act”), which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in West Virginia. Following passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, which authorized states to establish pilot programs for industrial hemp research, the West Virginia Department of Agriculture implemented a pilot program based on the authority already granted by the WV Hemp Act. From 2017 to 2019, the number of license-holders under the pilot program increased from 46 to 165. West Virginia’s 2019 amendments to the WV Hemp Act authorized the Commissioner of Agriculture to submit a state plan for regulation of industrial hemp to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. The West Virginia Department of Agriculture submitted such a plan on January 23, 2020, with a proposed effective date of October 31, 2020. The plan proposed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture is consistent with the West Virginia Department of Agriculture’s existing industrial hemp program.
The industry hemp program subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include crop-testing requirements to determine whether the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and submission to any inspection and sampling that the West Virginia Department of Agriculture deems necessary. Intentional violations of the WV Hemp Act and the West Virginia Department of Agriculture’s rules, as well as repeated negligent violations, may result in a loss of license.

Columbia Care’s subsidiary, Columbia Care WV Industrial Hemp LLC, applied for and was granted a license to develop an industrial hemp farm in West Virginia. The license authorizes Columbia Care to grow, process, cultivate, store, and handle raw industrial hemp.
WEST VIRGINIA
Regulatory Landscape
Senate Bill 386, signed into law on April 19, 2017, by Governor Jim Justice, created the Medical Cannabis Act that allows for cannabis to be used for certified medical use by a West Virginia resident with a serious medical condition and is limited to the following forms: pill; oil; topical forms including gels, creams or ointments; a form medically appropriate for administration by vaporization or nebulization, dry leaf or plant form; tincture; liquid; or dermal patch. The medical cannabis program is administered by the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Office of Medical Cannabis (the “WV Bureau”). The Office has authority to (1) issue and oversee permits that authorize businesses to grow, process, or dispense medical cannabis in compliance with state law and regulations, (2) register medical practitioners who certify patients as having qualifying serious medical conditions, and (3) register and oversee patients with qualifying conditions. Medical cannabis may only be dispensed to a patient who receives a certification from a practitioner and is in possession of a valid identification card issued by the WV Bureau ; and a caregiver who is in possession of a valid identification card issued by the Bureau. Products packaged by a grower/processor or sold by a dispensary shall only be identified by the name of the grower/processor, the name of the dispensary, the form and species of medical cannabis, the percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol contained in the product.

A dispensary that has been issued a permit may lawfully dispense medical cannabis to a patient or caregiver upon presentation to the dispensary of a valid identification card for that patient or caregiver. The dispensary shall provide to the patient or caregiver a receipt, as appropriate. The receipt shall include all of the following: the name, address, and any identification number assigned to the dispensary by the WV Bureau; the name and address of the patient and caregiver; the date the medical cannabis was dispensed; any requirement or limitation by the practitioner as to the form of medical cannabis for the patient; and the form and the quantity of medical cannabis dispensed. Dispensaries are prohibited from dispensing cannabis products to anyone other than a registered patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card from the Office. Dispensing amounts are limited to those indicated in a registered patient’s certification by his/her medical practitioner, and in any event a dispensary may not dispense more than a 30-day supply at a given time.
The WV Bureau and the Department of Revenue must monitor the price of medical cannabis sold by growers, processors and by dispensaries, including a per-dose price. If the WV Bureau and the Department of Revenue determine that the prices are unreasonable or excessive, the WV Bureau may implement a cap on the price of medical cannabis being sold for a period of six months.
The WV Bureau’s Office of Medical Cannabis (the “WV Office”) received applications for medical cannabis growers, processors, dispensaries, and laboratories in Spring 2020. The Office of Medical Cannabis issued 10 grower permits on October 3, 2020. It issued 10 processor permits on November 13, 2020.
