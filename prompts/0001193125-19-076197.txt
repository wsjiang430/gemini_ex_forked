 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 General 
 CSB Bancorp, Inc. (CSB), is a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1991. The Commercial and Savings Bank of Millersburg, Ohio (the Bank), an Ohio banking corporation chartered in 1879, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSB. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured up to the maximum amount provided by law by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The primary regulators of the Bank are the Federal Reserve Board and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions. CSB Investment Services, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (CSB Investment), is a wholly owned subsidiary of CSB that is licensed to engage in the business of insurance in the State of Ohio.

 Business Overview and Lending Activities 
 CSB operates primarily through the Bank and CSB Investment, providing a wide range of banking, trust, financial, and brokerage services to corporate, institutional, and individual customers throughout northeast Ohio. The Bank provides retail and commercial banking services to its customers, including checking and savings accounts, time deposits, IRAs, safe deposit facilities, personal loans, commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, installment loans, night depository facilities, brokerage, and trust services. 
 
2 


 The Bank provides residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial, and consumer loans to customers located primarily in Holmes, Stark, Tuscarawas, Wayne and portions of surrounding counties in Ohio. The Banks market area has historically exhibited relatively stable economic conditions. Economic activity in the Companys market area has been increasing at a steady pace for the past nine years. Reported unemployment levels at December 2018 in the four primary counties served by the Company ranged between 3.5% and 5.2%. These levels increased slightly from December 2017. Labor markets continued hiring at a softer pace during the year. Wage increases accelerated during 2018. The local housing market continues to improve with supply relatively tight. Elevated costs of building materials have contributed to increased housing construction costs. Consumer confidence in the economy has been a primary driver for the strong housing demand and higher consumer spending. 
 Certain risks are involved in providing loans, including, but not limited to, the borrowers ability and willingness to repay the debt. Before the Bank extends a new loan or renews an existing loan to a customer, these risks are assessed through a review of the borrowers past and current credit history, the collateral being used to secure the transaction if any, and other factors. For all commercial loan relationships greater than $300,000 the Banks internal credit department performs an annual risk rating review. In addition to this review, an independent, outside loan review firm is engaged to review a sample of watch list and adversely classified credits over $250,000 and a sample of commercial loan relationships greater than $250,000. The outside loan review will also assess managements current credit grades and provide commentary with regard to assigned ratings and the need for a credit to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring, as well as assess managements specific loan loss reserves for loans included in their sample that are considered to be impaired. In addition, any loan over $100,000 identified as a problem credit by management and/or the external loan review consultants is assigned to the Banks loan watch list, has a written action plan created, and is subject to ongoing review at least quarterly by the Banks credit department and the assigned loan officer to ensure appropriate action is taken if deterioration continues. 
 Commercial loan rates are variable and fixed, and include operating lines of credit and term loans made to small businesses, primarily based on their ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the business. Business assets such as equipment, accounts receivable, and inventory typically secure such loans. When the borrower is not an individual, the Bank generally obtains the personal guarantee of the business owner. These loans typically involve larger loan balances, are generally dependent on the cash flow of the business, and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the general economy or in a specific industry. Management reviews the borrowers cash flows when deciding whether to grant the credit in order to evaluate whether estimated future cash flows will be adequate to service principal and interest of the new obligation in addition to existing obligations. 
 Commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by borrower-occupied business real estate and are dependent on the ability of the related business to generate adequate cash flow to service the debt. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. Commercial construction loans are secured by commercial real estate and in most cases the Bank also provides the permanent financing. The Bank monitors advances and the maximum loan to value ratio is typically limited to the lesser of 90% of cost or 80% of appraisal value. Management performs much of the same analysis when deciding whether to grant a commercial real estate loan as when deciding whether to grant a commercial loan. 
 Residential real estate loans carry both fixed and variable rates and are secured by the borrowers residence. Such loans are made based on the borrowers ability to make repayment from employment and other income. Management assesses the borrowers ability and willingness to repay the debt through review of credit history and ratings, verification of employment and other income, review of debt-to-income ratios, and other measures of repayment ability. The Bank generally makes these loans in amounts of 80% or less of the value of the collateral or up to 95% of collateral value with private mortgage insurance. An appraisal from a qualified real estate appraiser or an evaluation based on comparable market values is obtained for substantially all loans secured by real estate. Residential construction loans are secured by residential real estate that generally will be occupied by the borrower upon completion. The Bank usually makes the permanent loan at the end of the construction phase. Generally, construction loans are made in amounts of 80% or less of the value of the as-completed collateral. 
 Home equity lines of credit are made to individuals and are secured by second or first mortgages on the borrowers residence. Loans are based on similar credit and appraisal criteria used for residential real estate loans; however, loans up to 100% of the value of the property may be approved for borrowers with excellent credit histories. These loans typically bear interest at variable rates and require minimum monthly payments of the accrued interest. 
 Installment loans to individuals include unsecured loans and loans secured by recreational vehicles (RVs), automobiles, and other consumer assets. Consumer loans for the purchase of new RVs and new automobiles generally do not exceed 125% of Dealer Invoice on RVs or 110% of the Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price 
 
3 


  (MSRP) of an automobile. Loans for used RVs and automobiles do not exceed 120% of the clean trade-in value as reported in the current NADA used guides. Overdraft protection loans are unsecured personal lines of credit to individuals who have demonstrated good credit character with reasonably assured sources of income and satisfactory credit histories. Consumer loans generally involve more risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of collateral and, in certain types of consumer loans, absence of collateral. Since these loans are generally repaid from ordinary income of the individual or family unit, repayment may be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, ill health, or by a general decline in economic conditions. The Bank assesses the borrowers ability and willingness to repay through a review of credit history, credit ratings, debt-to-income ratios, and other measures of repayment ability. 
 While CSBs chief decision-makers monitor the revenue streams of the various financial products and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the Companys banking operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. For a discussion of the Companys financial performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had 190 employees, 153 of which were employed on a full-time basis. CSB has no separate employees not also employed by the Bank. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees are provided benefit programs, some of which are contributory. Management considers its employee relations to be good. 
Competition 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. In its primary market area of Holmes, Stark, Tuscarawas, Wayne and surrounding Ohio counties, the Bank competes for new deposit dollars and loans with other commercial banks, including both large regional banks and smaller community banks, as well as savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, investment companies, and technology-based providers of financial services (sometimes referred to as fintech companies). 
 Competition within the financial service industry continues to increase as a result of mergers between, and expansion of, financial service providers within and outside of the Companys primary market areas. In addition, securities firms and insurance companies that have elected to become financial holding companies may acquire commercial banks and other financial institutions, which can create additional competitive pressure. 
 Management believes the primary factors in competing for loans and deposits are interest rates, availability of services, quality of customer service, convenience, and name recognition. Some of the Companys competitors may have greater resources and as such, higher lending limits, or fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures, all of which may adversely affect the Companys ability to compete.

 Supervision and Regulation of CSB and the Bank 
 CSB and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. The regulation of financial holding companies and their subsidiaries by bank regulatory agencies is intended primarily for the protection of consumers, depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders.

 CSB is a bank holding company that has registered with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the BHC Act). Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if it meets certain capital requirements and is well-managed and each of its subsidiary banks is well-capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions, is well-managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). CSB has been a financial holding company since 2005. No prior regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire certain companies, other than banks and savings associations, that are financial in nature as determined by the FRB. The financial holding company and its subsidiaries must continue to meet the above described requirements in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without being subjected to regulatory actions or restrictions, which could include a requirement to divest of the subsidiary or subsidiaries. 
 GLBA defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency activities; merchant banking activities; and activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking. As a financial holding company, CSB is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the FRB under the BHC Act. CSB is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as administered by the SEC. 
 The Bank, as an Ohio state-chartered bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions and the FRB. Because the FDIC insures its deposits, the Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations. The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures the deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations, and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry. The Banks deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in July 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act). 
 The earnings, dividends, and other aspects of the operations and activities of CSB and the Bank are affected by state and federal laws and regulations, and by policies of various regulatory authorities. These policies include, for example, statutory maximum lending rates, requirements on maintenance of reserves against deposits, domestic monetary policies of the FRB, United States fiscal and economic policies, international currency regulations, and monetary policies, certain restrictions on relationships with many phases of the securities business, and capital adequacy, and liquidity restraints. 
 The following information describes selected federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions that have, or could have, a material impact on the Companys business. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the particular statutory or regulatory provisions. These statutes and regulations are continually under review by the United States Congress and state legislatures, and state and federal regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to CSB and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on their respective businesses. 
 Regulation of Bank Holding Companies 
 As a financial holding company under GLBA, CSBs activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FRB. CSB is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject to regular examination and inspection by the FRB. 
 The FRB has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders, and require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including subsidiary banks). The FRB may initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations, and for unsafe and unsound practices. Under FRB policies, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the FRB may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. 
 The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB in cases where a bank holding company proposes to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by it, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or another financial or bank holding company, or merge or consolidate with any other financial or bank holding company.

 The FRB also regulates and provides limitations on transactions between affiliates of a bank holding company, loans to directors and officers of bank affiliates, securities transactions, and liability for losses incurred by commonly controlled banks in certain circumstances. 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act 
 On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Regulatory Relief Act) was signed into law. The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the FRB takes action to maintain those standards. Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to CSB even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act. 
 The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible assets to average consolidated assets is between 8% and 10%, unless the banks federal banking agency determines that the organizations risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FRB, and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets. Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets). Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator. 
 The OCC, the FRB, and the FDIC also adopted a rule providing banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
 The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements. 
 Regulatory Capital 
 The FRB adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks, designed to absorb losses. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework, which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain Prompt Corrective Action regulatory provisions. 
 Basel III Capital Rules (Basel III) became effective on January 1, 2015, and contain a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital that phased in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and deductions from common equity tier 1 capital that have mostly phased in as of January 1, 2019. 
 The rules include (a) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, (b) a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, (c) a minimum capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 
 Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 
 Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions. 
 
6 


 Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions. 
 The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organizations own capital instruments, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). 
 Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 The rules place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the Company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5% composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and is fully phased in at 2.50% effective January 1, 2019. Pursuant to the FRBs Small Bank Holding Company Policy statement (SBHC Policy), a bank holding company with assets of less than $1 billion and meeting certain other requirements is not required to comply with the consolidated capital requirements until such company exceeds $1 billion in assets or is otherwise determined by the FRB not to qualify as a small bank holding company. At December 31, 2018, CSB was deemed to be a small bank holding company under the SBHC Policy and was not required to comply with the FRBs regulatory capital requirements. The Bank, however, must comply with the new capital requirements. 
 The implementation of Basel III did not have a material impact on CSBs or the Banks capital ratios. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 The federal banking agencies have established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve certain of the problems of undercapitalized institutions. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. 
 The federal banking agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a banks capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after it becomes critically undercapitalized unless the banks primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a banks capital category. For example, a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the banks capital plan for the plan to be acceptable. 
 In order to be well-capitalized, a bank must have a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the ratio requirements in effect at that date to be deemed well-capitalized. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on page 51 of CSBs 2018 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Management of the Company believes the Bank also meets the capital requirements to be deemed well-capitalized under the new guidelines. 
 Deposit Insurance 
 Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, and the Bank is assessed quarterly deposit insurance premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Insurance premiums for each insured institution are determined based upon the institutions capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the institutions primary federal regulator and other information deemed 
 
7 


  by the FDIC to be relevant to the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund by the institution. The assessment rate is then applied to the amount of the institutions assessment base to determine the institutions insurance premium. The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated on average assets less average tangible equity. 
 The FDIC assesses a quarterly deposit insurance premium on each insured institution based on risk characteristics of the institution and may also impose special assessments in emergency situations. The premiums fund the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), which is the amount in the DIF as a percentage of all DIF insured deposits. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. Although the FDICs new rules reduced assessment rates on all banks, they imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more to be paid until the DRR reaches 1.35%. The DRR reached 1.36% at September 30, 2018. The rules also provide assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%. Such credits will be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. The rules further changed the method of determining risk-based assessment rates for established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than banks that take on less risk. 
 In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, which was established by the government to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September of 2019. The Financing Corporation has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 29, 2019, FDIC invoice. 
 As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, federally-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any federally-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. 
 The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 
 Fiscal and Monetary Policies 
 The business and earnings of the Company are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the United States Government and its agencies. These policies are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. CSB is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which has regulatory authority over the supply of money and credit in the United States. 
 The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have significant effects in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the economy, the money markets, and the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, the Company can make no definitive predictions as to future changes in interest rates, credit availability, or deposit levels. 
 Limits on Dividends and Other Payments 
 There are various legal limitations on the extent to which subsidiary banks may finance or otherwise supply funds to their parent holding companies. Under applicable federal and state laws, subsidiary banks may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, their bank holding companies. Subsidiary banks are also subject to collateral security requirements for any loan or extension of credit permitted by such exceptions. 
 Payments of dividends by the Bank are limited by applicable state and federal laws and regulations. The ability of CSB to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by the Bank. However, the FRB expects CSB to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and may require CSB to retain capital for further investment in the Bank, rather than pay dividends to CSB shareholders. Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of 
 
8 


  its applicable regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting CSBs ability to pay dividends on its common shares. 
 FRB policy requires CSB to provide notice to the FRB in advance of the payment of a dividend to CSBs shareholders under certain circumstances and states that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The FRB may disapprove of a dividend payment if the FRB determines that the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice. 
 Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations 
 Banks are subject to regular examination to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations applicable to their business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations. Potential penalties under these laws include, but are not limited to, fines. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has adopted numerous rules with respect to consumer protection laws, amending some existing regulations and adopting new ones, and has commenced enforcement actions. The following are just some of the consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank: 

● | Community Reinvestment Act of 1977: imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation to fulfill the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law. 
 In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the Payday Rule) with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections is required starting on August 19, 2019. The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as certain other longer-term loans that are repaid directly from the borrowers account. The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrowers account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumers new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrowers account. 
 On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020. It has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days. Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that: (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The CFPB has requested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that it

  will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives. The Company is evaluating the proposal and believes the types of consumer credit extended by the Company will be excluded or exempted under the Rule. 
 Customer Privacy 
 Under the GLBA, federal banking agencies have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require distribution of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. 
USA Patriot Act 
 In response to the events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) was signed into law in October, 2001. The Patriot Act provides for financial institutions to establish programs and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In addition, federal banking agencies are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering policies, procedures, and controls of the applicants. 
 The Bank has established policies and procedures to be compliant with the requirements of the Patriot Act. 
 Corporate Governance 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) effected broad reforms to areas of financial disclosure and corporate governance. The Board of Directors reviews the Companys corporate governance practices on a continuing basis. In accordance with section 302(a) of SOX, written certifications by CSBs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that CSBs quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state a material fact. CSB has also implemented a program designed to comply with Section 404 of SOX, which includes identification of significant processes and accounts, documentation of the design of control effectiveness over process and entity-level controls, and testing of the operating effectiveness of key controls. As of June 30, 2017, the market value of CSBs common shares held by nonaffiliates exceeded $75 million, as a result of which CSB is required to provide annually an auditors attestation and report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Managements assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm opinion on internal control over financial reporting are located on pages 22 and 23 of CSBs 2018 Annual Report. 
Effect of Environmental Regulation 
 Compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of CSB or its subsidiaries. CSB believes the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact. CSB, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for its current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future. 
 CSB believes its primary exposure to environmental risk is through the lending activities of the Bank. In cases where management believes environmental risk potentially exists, the Bank mitigates environmental risk exposure by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites.

 Executive and Incentive Compensation 
 In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (the Joint Guidance) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors. 
 Pursuant to the Joint Guidance, the FRB will review as part of a regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions such as the Company. Such review will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institutions supervisory ratings, which can affect the institutions ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and prompt and effective measures are not being taken to correct the deficiencies. 
 The Companys board and management believe its policies and procedures related to Executive and Incentive Compensation are compliant with the Joint Guidance. 
 Future Legislation 
 Various and significant legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time adopted by the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, and regulatory agencies frequently adopt or amend regulations. Such legislation and regulation may continue to change banking laws and regulations and the operating environment of CSB and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could significantly increase or decrease costs of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among financial institutions. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions remains very unpredictable.

 The following is a schedule of fixed rate and variable rate commercial, commercial real estate and construction and land development loans due after one year from December 31, 2018. 
 

(Dollars in thousands) | | Fixed Rate | | | Variable Rate
Total commercial, commercial real estate and construction and land development loans due after one year | $ | | 43,713 | $ | | 229,585

 The following schedule summarizes nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans. 
 

(Dollars in thousand) | | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Loans accounted for on a nonaccural basis | $ | | 3,155 | $ | 6,081 | | $ | | 1,449 | $ | 1,576 | $ | 3,668
Accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments | | | 174 | | 441 | | | | 235 | | 105 | | 281 
Total | $ | | 3,329 | $ | 6,522 | | $ | | 1,684 | $ | 1,681 | $ | 3,949

 The policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is to cease accruing interest on loans when management believes that collection of interest is doubtful, when commercial loans are past due as to principal and interest 90 days or more or when mortgage loans are past due as to principal and interest 120 days or more, except that in certain circumstances interest accruals are continued on loans deemed by management to be well-secured and in process of collection. In such cases, loans are individually evaluated in order to determine whether to continue income recognition after 90 days beyond the due date. When loans are placed on nonaccrual, any accrued interest is charged against interest income.

 Information regarding impaired loans at December 31 is as follows: 
 
(Dollars in thousands) | | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Total recorded investment of impaired loans | $ | | 3,860 | $ | 7,882 | | $ | 7,173
Less portion for which no allowance for loan loss is allocated | | | 3,122 | | 5,565 | | | 3,326
Portion of impaired loan balance for which an allowance for loan losses is allocated | | | 738 | | 2,317 | | | 3,847
Portion of allowance for loan losses allocated to the impaired loan balance at December 31 | | | 101 | | 244 | | | 729 

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to $113 thousand, while $371 thousand would have been recognized had the loans been performing under their contractual terms. For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to $123 thousand, while $426 thousand would have been recognized had the loans been performing under their contractual terms. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to $312 thousand while $426 thousand would have been recognized had the loans been performing under their contractual terms. 
 Impaired loans are comprised of commercial, commercial real estate, and residential real estate loans, and are carried at the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for loan losses is allocated to impaired loans. 
 Smaller-balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total. Such loans include residential first-mortgage loans secured by one to four-family residences, residential construction loans, automobile loans, home equity loans, and second-mortgage loans. These consumer loans are included in nonaccrual and past due disclosures above as well as impaired loans when they become nonperforming. Commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment. When analysis of borrower operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrowers business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements, the loan is evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans or portions thereof, are charged-off when deemed uncollectible. 
 At December 31, 2018, no loans were identified that management had serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present loan repayment terms that are not included in the tables set forth above. On a monthly basis, the Company internally classifies certain loans based on various factors. At December 31, 2018, these amounts, including impaired and nonperforming loans, amounted to $29 million of substandard loans and $0 doubtful loans. 
 As of December 31, 2018, there were no concentrations of loans greater than 10% of total loans that were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in the loan portfolio table set forth above.

 The allowance for loan losses balance and provision charged to expense are determined by management based on periodic reviews of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, economic conditions, and various other circumstances subject to change over time. In making this judgment, management reviews selected large loans, as well as impaired loans, other delinquent, nonaccrual and problem loans, and loans to industries experiencing economic difficulties. The collectability of these loans is evaluated after considering current operating results and financial position of the borrower, estimated market value of collateral, guarantees and the Companys collateral position versus other creditors. Judgments, which are necessarily subjective, as to the probability of loss and amount of such loss are formed on these loans, as well as other loans taken together.

 The following schedule is a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses allocated by type of loan and related ratios. While managements periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses may allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem-loan situations, the entire allowance is available for any loan charge-offs that occur.
