Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 
The financial services industry is going through a period of intensive change driven by the advancement of technology and the rapid rise of contactless transactions due to societal changes, in part, as a response to COVID-19. End-users expect ease of use and an enhanced user experience in all their daily financial interactions. In this rapidly evolving digital marketplace, businesses have broad and frequently changing requirements to meet consumer expectations and operational efficiencies to maintain their competitive edge.
 
To survive and succeed in this environment, businesses need to adopt new technologies to engage, communicate and process payments and manage payouts with their customers from a supplier that widely supports innovation and adaptation as the industry evolves. We believe our technologies will greatly increase the adoption of omni-channel payments and digital banking solutions in sectors that must quickly adapt and migrate to new, secure digital Fintech technologies. By embracing advancements in the payment and banking industries, we are well-positioned to meet the growing needs of existing and prospective clients and intend for our current and future products to be at the forefront of solving these accelerated market needs.
 
AppTech’s all-new, innovative Fintech platform, “Commerse™” officially launched in October 2022. The platform delivers best-in-class financial technologies and capabilities through an ever-evolving modular cloud/edge-based architecture. The Commerse platform houses a large array of financial products and services that can be implemented off-the-shelf or customized via modern APIs. Within its Commerse platform, AppTech offers three primary products: Payments-as-a-Service (“PaaS”), Banking-as-a-Service (“BaaS”), and Commerce-as-a-Service (“CXS”).


Commerse provides PaaS via integrated solutions for frictionless digital and mobile payment acceptance. These solutions provide advanced payment processing solutions for credit cards, ACH, and gift/loyalty cards by catering to the unique needs of each merchant. PaaS will also solve for multi-use case, multi-channel, API-driven, account-based issuer processing for card, digital tokens, and payment transfer transactions.
 
AppTech is positioned to further accelerate digital transformation through BaaS, layered with financial management tools that empower financial institutions to provide businesses, professionals, and individuals with the ability to better manage their finances anywhere, anytime at a fraction of the cost of traditional banking and financial services. BaaS creates an ecosystem of immersive and scalable digital financial management services backed by Mastercard & Visa processing certifications.
 
Commerse has a flexible architecture to allow for rich, personalized payment and banking experiences. This first-to-market, cloud-based CXS platform packages together elements of AppTech’s intellectual property, BaaS, PaaS and other related technologies to create seamless interactions throughout the customer journey.
 
The platform also incorporates AppTech’s core, patented text payment and geofence triggered ecommerce and/or advertising via cell phone capabilities delivering experiences that focus on frictionless use cases and end-users desire for payment transaction simplicity, control, and comfort. The Company believes that these features will be particularly beneficial for unbanked and under-banked in developing or emerging markets where access to the internet on a mobile device and modern banking institutions may not be readily available. Particularly by extending merchants’ marketplace capabilities via new channels to request and receive frictionless, digital payments and engaging end-users by utilizing a familiar, convenient, and widely adopted technology.

Industry Background
 
The financial technology and payment processing industries are an integral part of today’s worldwide financial structure. The electronic payments industry is massive, with growth fueled by powerful long-term trends that continue to increase the acceptance and use of electronic payments compared to paper-based payments. According to The Nilson Report, purchase volume on credit, debit and prepaid cards in the United States is estimated to reach nearly $10.4 trillion by 2027, a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6.1%.[1]
 
According to American Banker, the banking and financial services incumbents are failing to compete on customer experience, which is a weakness Fintechs are very successfully exploiting.[2] In fact, based on a 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers Global Fintech Report, industry executives believe that 25% or more of their business could be at risk of being lost to standalone Fintechs within five years.[3] Furthermore, according to Allied Market Research, the global digital banking platform market size is projected to reach $10.87 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 13.6% from 2020 to 2027.[4] All of this research and expert opinion provides a clear picture of the opportunities ahead for Fintechs that can provide innovative commerce solutions and experiences that resonate with clients, their customers and the market as a whole.
 
According to a Walker report, customer experience will overtake price and product features as the key brand differentiator this year. Moreover, according to research from PricewaterhouseCoopers, an immersive and engaging customer experience drives more customer spending.[5] In fact, 86% of buyers are willing to pay more when immersed in a great customer experience – Experience outweighs cost.
 
The payment processing industry continues to evolve rapidly based on the application of new technology and changing customer needs. Changes in technology have allowed for new payment methods, such as mobile and contactless payments, which is driving demand for new innovative solutions to meet consumer expectations. This results in businesses increasingly being required to deliver new, convenient methods of interacting with their customers to ensure loyalty and repeat business. As consumers continue to integrate mobile devices into their lives, there will be increased demand to conduct business on these devices. According to Global Industry Analysts, the global mobile payment market was valued at $1,449.56 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach over $5,399.6 billion in 2026 with growth at a CAGR of 24.5% over the forecast period (2021 – 2026).[6]
 
GSMA Intelligence reported in 2019 that globally, there are more than 9.2 billion mobile connections and 5.1 billion mobile subscribers with text messaging capabilities.[7] Statista asserted that just over 3.9 billion of these devices have access to mobile internet.[8]

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our adaptable technology stack and product offerings differentiate us from our competitors. Our products and solutions help to eliminate much of our sector’s reliance on legacy payment rails and financial systems. The design and delivery are not being restricted by antiquated foundational technology. Management believes the applicability and frictionless nature of our products will offer an immediate impact on the digital financial services industry. Further, the solutions we intend to deliver to our clients will be driven off user-centered design principles to providing seamless, best-in-class experiences to the end-user.
 
Digital transformation is complex for most companies sighting such concerns around shifting company culture, legacy systems, rigidity of platforms and processes, inefficiencies in skill sets and knowledge. Additionally, even when these companies see the value in digital transformation, often these companies face an inability to properly shift resources to new technology while maintaining customers on existing platforms. Non-discretionary spend required to “keep the lights on” outweighs leadership’s ability to invest in future technology, which results in vulnerabilities and competitive threats.
 
Our financial services platform will empower our clients with an extensible, adaptable framework capable of dynamically solving challenges found across the financial services industry. Further, this ability will allow us to drive deeply and expediently into specific market segments to solve problems that we find to be a continued burden on our client’s and their customer base. Based on market, client and end-user research and discovery, it is expected that these unique solutions produced for client’s will be highly leverageable across these segments to deliver experiences at scale while producing rapid revenue and profitability.
 
As we increase our client base and deployment of solutions to meet our client’s specifications, we’ll continue to grow these “off-the-shelf” experiences that will ultimately lower our development costs while increasing speed to market. In addition, we are positioned to utilize this model to grow industry partnerships and app marketplace plugins thus further leveraging our capabilities and market reach.
 
Founded on a modern core platform backed by an intelligent financial technology framework, our ability to rapidly deploy solutions and experiences that are otherwise cumbersome, expensive and often fall short of expectations will prove successful. Once launched, our position is to penetrate deep into certain segments to build a model that will directly drive growth. Gaining robust insights in these segments while delivering best-in-class experiences will also produce future opportunities to expand our off-the-shelf solutions to other verticals or sub-verticals that are challenged with solving similar problems.
 
While our core foundational platform will continue to adapt and grow based on new innovations, we are launching into the market an extremely robust and innovative set of secure digital banking and payments features and functionality. This will allow us to quickly deliver the future of digital finance to meet the demands of the markets we intend to serve without the deployment burdens encumbering the market today.
 
Additionally, the patent protection for some of our products is uncommon within the Fintech industry. This protection prevents competitors from replicating our products to carve away at our anticipated market share. Therefore, backing our text payment and lead generation products with patents strengthens the viability of such products by limiting direct competition and strengthening strategic partnerships. It is expected that we will also expand our patent portfolio through new innovations and acquisitions.
 
Our patent protected text payment system’s anticipated capabilities also set us apart. By creating a product that permits mobile payments without the need for a data plan, internet or an application -after an initial account is established-, we will have the unique ability to extend our customer base to target unbanked and underbanked individuals primarily in developing or emerging markets. Integrating consumers that are not traditionally included in the payment space will allow us to have a larger potential market than many of our competitors.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We intend to grow by leveraging our existing IP, continually developing products and solutions, establishing strategic partnerships and seeking selective acquisitions that uniquely complement our core business to meet growing market demand. From traditional merchant accounts to customizable inbound and outbound payment solutions, we intend to modernize and enhance the payment processing and digital banking capabilities for businesses throughout the world. Our business objective is to generate revenue based on licensing and subscription fees, transactional processing fees, product line growth, and continual advancement of our IP portfolio.
 
Our target market is forward-thinking financial institutions, technology companies, and SMEs seeking to broaden their distribution through the addition of digital omnichannel payments and digital banking technologies. We will serve these markets by reducing integration complexity and streamlining their integrated financial services capabilities.
 
SMEs generally lack the resources of large enterprises to invest heavily in technology. As a result, they are more dependent on service providers, like AppTech, to handle critical functions including payment acceptance and other support services and are likely to be early adopters of new services that will further increase their efficiency and drive growth. Additionally, we are targeting financial institutions looking to maintain their ability to compete by digitizing their financial services offerings to meet market demand. By enhancing their customer’s user experience through the development of innovative and user centric multi-channel, multi-currency, digital financial products, they will be able to maintain customer loyalty.
 
We intend to support a multi-method distribution model to achieve our vision. By providing delivery flexibility, we can rapidly engage and develop the right go-to-market strategies. As previously mentioned, not only are off-the-shelf solutions available, but we also offer embedded experiences that can be deployed using a growing portfolio of Open and Private APIs for developers to build unique experiences based on business cases and requirements.
 
Further, by offering clients a full array of marketing technology services, omnichannel payments and digital banking technologies, we will enable them to better interact with their customers and provide additional, dynamic means of processing both inbound and outbound financial transactions.
 
Businesses’ financial technology needs are increasingly complex. As electronic and mobile commerce continues to grow, businesses have no alternative but to use technology to better meet customer’s expectations. We believe that delivering innovative, adaptive, scalable, and operationally efficient products that meet their financial services needs will result in rapid market penetration for our anticipated products launches.
 
While leveraging new technology is vital to our growth plan, it is equally important that the technology is relevant and seamlessly fits into and benefits our end-user’s daily lives. Consumers are sometimes reluctant to alter their typical routines, especially when it relates to financial services. The anticipated launch of our text payment system and broader digital banking and payments solutions will meet both needs. We will offer financial technologies that do not rely on legacy rails, thus increasing the opportunity to improve the end-user’s digital experiences. Once properly developed and rolled out, we anticipate rapid adoption.
 
We seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 

● | Increasing our customer base by offering unique and compelling, patent protected technology solutions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Driving growth in our merchant services business through new and flexible technologies, including our secure text payment system, that will enable our customers to adapt to a rapidly changing marketplace; 
● | Rolling-out our API-driven, account-based, issuer processing solution for card, digital token, and payment transfer transactions that will enable us to target multi-currency and multi-channel digital banking and embedded B2B payment opportunities; 
● | Providing advanced technology to our clients to engage end-users via lead generation and text marketing services to enable businesses to better communicate with their customers and integrate our full suite of products; 
● | Maintaining technological leadership by continuing to innovate and improve our scalable, extensible, cloud-based technology; 
● | Pursuing strategic acquisitions, investments, or partnerships to complement and bolster our suite of Fintech products; 
● | Creating cross-selling synergies through white-labeling or SaaS distribution enabling us to provide a holistic suite of products and services to financial institutions, technology companies, and SMEs;

Our market growth strategies will focus on the following elements: (1) new product development and delivery (2) market penetration (3) market expansion (4) IP, strategic acquisitions, and partnerships.
 
It is imperative that upon entrance into the market with the new platform, we focus on delivering an enhanced experience to our existing digital client base. As we roll this out, we will also continue discussions with our current and continually evolving pipeline of prospects to understand these opportunities and the value that we can bring to solve their needs. This strategy also provides growth opportunities with these clients, increases customer satisfaction and potential referrals, and produces valuable feedback into our product prioritization and roadmap.
 
Maintaining focus to deliver our technology to selective target market segments also allows us to deliver a deeper, more targeted set of solutions and experiences. In turn this will grow our knowledge within these select segments that will translate into further innovation and market penetration.
 
This continual development process will contribute to our overall strategy of delivering new, innovative technologies and solutions. It is expected that bringing these to market will expand opportunities in complimentary and new market segments. Given the Platform’s flexibility and a la carte capabilities, adapting these solutions and delivering new experiences is a core tenant to growth.
 
In addition, core to our values and strategy is the opportunity for growth through intellectual property. This is inclusive of the existing patent portfolio while also coupled with future innovation. It is also important to continually evaluate new technologies, market entrants and complimentary solutions to ensure continued growth. We expect that this will include strategic acquisitions of complimentary offerings and portfolio customers, while also focusing on strategic partnerships where we find synergy in our vision.
 
With years of Fintech experience and a deep understanding of the industry, management believes we can leverage this expertise, industry contacts and past clients to accelerate market penetration. Engaging individuals with the ability to integrate our products may prove invaluable. Further, through our channel partnerships, we have an expansive network of potential clients that continue to show interest in our strategy and opportunity to embed our financial technologies into their solutions.
 
Management believes there are substantial opportunities in emerging and developing markets for our anticipated products. Our mobile payment and digital banking solutions offer innovative avenues to unbanked and underbanked communities to transact and provide remittances. Further, since internet connectivity is not required for our text payment solution, individuals with limited internet access will still be able to transact. These two factors could open our products to markets with immense growth potential.
 
With our in-house expertise and our internationally experienced and proven team of subject matter experts via our partnership with Infinios Financial Services BSC’s (formally NEC Payments B.S.C.), we are focused on resources on delivering growth using the strategies described above. Both teams operate together in full confidence that the business is being powered by innovative technology IP running on robust, secure and scalable cloud infrastructure. We expect to continue the innovative development of the core platform while also developing alongside targeted market segments and clients to deliver productized, secure and scalable solutions and experiences.

Our Products and Services
 
We are developing and preparing to deploy a digital-first Fintech platform that empowers financial institutions and enterprise brands to deliver “best-of-breed” B2B and B2C experiences through our revolutionary platform and deployment model. Our modular platform will seamlessly integrate with legacy and cloud platforms to power a multitude of commerce experiences, including digital payments, financial wellness and more.
Merchant Services
 
Our core historical business is merchant transaction services. We create revenue by processing payments for credit and debit cards via POS (point of sale) equipment, e-commerce gateways, periodic ACH (automatic clearing house) payments and gift & loyalty programs. We currently support over 100 merchants representing dozens of market verticals in managing their financial transactions.
 
Each merchant has unique needs for payment processing. As a result, we have a variety of processing partners to meet each merchant’s requirements. In addition to these needs, we take into consideration certain aspects of each business in choosing the optimal processing partner including risk, volume, customer service, integration capabilities, product features and profitability.
 
Our processing partners include Total Systems Services (“TSYS”)/Global Payments., JetPay an NCR Payment Solutions Company, Harbortouch Payments a Shift4 Company, Cynergy Data/Priority Payments Systems Group, FIS, Nuvei, and Cardconnect/Fiserv Inc., with each providing products and services that meet each of our merchants’ needs. Currently, our partners manage our backend payment processing needs in addition to managing risk and compliance on our behalf. Through the implementation of our proprietary payment processing protocols as we grow our customer base and technology, we expect to manage the risk and compliance ourselves, which will increase our margins on each transaction processed.
 
Digital Financial Technology Platform consisting of Omnichannel Payments and Digital Banking
 
To power commerce experiences, our digital financial technology platform (the “Platform”) is being, in part, licensed from Infinios and incorporates two distinct product pillars: (1) omnichannel payments featuring patented SMS text payment technology and (2) digital banking capabilities including multi-currency solutions, hyper-segmented savings accounts, buy now, pay later (“BNPL”) and next generation card issuance. The omnichannel payments pillar will consist of several stand-alone solutions, including hosted ecommerce checkout, a flexible payment gateway, patented text payment technology, digital wallets, alternative payment methods (APMs), as well as mobile and contactless payments. The Platform’s digital banking pillar will supply financial institutions with technology to give their customers – businesses, professionals, and individuals the ability to better manage their finances anywhere, anytime and at a fraction of the cost of traditional banking and financial services.
 
Developing and deploying embedded commerce experiences runs atop the Platform stack. This will include 1) open and private payment and digital banking APIs, 2) select third-party APIs centered on personalization and automation, 3) UI/UX blueprints and design assets 4) online collaboration and development tools, and 5) optional professional services engagement and support.
 
Similar to experience-focused offerings, our Platform powers immersive content, conversion, marketing automation, payment, and value transfer capabilities for nearly every online and offline shopping, banking, and financial services scenario. Additionally, our Platform experiences can be taken off-the-shelf or tapped into via modern APIs to build and embed fully branded and customizable experiences.
 
In many cases, our products and services are both available off-the-shelf or through embedded commerce experiences. For example, our patented text payment capabilities can be licensed off-the-shelf, so our clients can take advantage of quick market entry while doing this without any lifting or technical requirements. Alternatively, text payment capabilities and feature sets are available via our open APIs so businesses can embed and customize the experience, i.e. alter the onboarding experience and subscription triggers.

We believe text payment’s simple payment process has widespread application and potential for widespread adoption by mobile users because it utilizes a technology many end users are comfortable with and use daily. The process is quick and user-friendly allowing businesses to simply expand their payment receiving capabilities. The integration of direct, reliable, instant, and familiar text messaging with secure payments is a vital step in how we believe we bridge the gap between Fintech and mobile wireless systems.
 
Our white-label, digital banking technology platform with payment capabilities will equip financial institutions (Fis), technology providers and brands with a digital “bank-in-a-box” – also referred to as our Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) product. Furthermore, our Platform will enable multi-channel, multi-currency, pure digital financial services products unlike many other providers in the world. It incorporates a “plug-and-play” capability to facilitate deep integration with payment gateways, POS merchant services, alternative payment mechanisms, open-banking, ERP (“Enterprise Resource Planning”), CRM and web and mobile user interfaces to form an end-to-end, embedded, payment acceptance and digital banking solution that drives innovative and disruptive digital distribution products. Anticipated products include:
 

● | Neo-Banking for consumers and SMEs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Embedded B2B and consumer virtual payments (VCNs); 
● | Multi-currency money management and P2P money transfer; 
● | Payroll, expenses, management and B2C and G2C disbursements; 
● | Treasury management; 
● | Gift, incentive and reward programs for retail, wholesale and employee benefits; 
● | Any other product that requires a prepaid or credit balance to be held and transacted upon.

 
Other attributes to our Platform will include:
 

● | Patented Technology including a Text-to-Pay patent that enables B2B, B2C and P2P payments via SMS, mobile push, email and other forms of embedded links. Combined with four mobile-to-computer messaging and lead generation patents, we can enable financial institutions, technology companies and businesses to unlock innovative customer experiences. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personalization and User Experience are also at the core of our Platform. Through marketing automation capabilities, our Platform will provide an industry first online-to-offline customer attribution capability. Licensees of our Platform will be able to link their customer’s online behavior to their buying preferences in real-time in order to personalize the selling and buying experience, streamline checkout and improve conversion rates. 
● | Automation is delivered through our APIs to unlock automated financial transactions and customer experiences. For example, our Platform can be simply configured to create many types of automated customer benefits and incentives including instant cashback or added-value promotions. Further, our Platform will be easily leverageable to create similar money saving experiences like round ups, i.e., rounding to the nearest dollar and depositing the difference between the purchase price and round-up into a digital bank account.
● | Integration and Embedded Payments are central functions of our Platform. As such, we offer developers and enterprises an open platform with flexible rest APIs to build new payment and financial transaction features in SaaS and cloud apps, or create compelling new digital financial services user experiences from scratch. 

 
Our Platform continues to be developed including integration, testing and proper technical certifications before market readiness and client delivery. Management began beta testing the platform at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect that our Platform will continue to evolve as discussed to continually provide ongoing improvements, new features and functions and improved opportunities to deliver best in class experiences to the markets we serve.
