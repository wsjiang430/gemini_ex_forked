ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "our Company", "The Aaron's Company,", "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to The Aaron’s Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, which holds, directly or indirectly, the assets and liabilities historically associated with the historical Aaron’s Business segment (the "Aaron’s Business") prior to the 2020 separation of the Aaron's Business segment from the Progressive Leasing and Vive segments further described below. 
Our Company
The Company is a leading, technology-enabled, omni-channel provider of lease-to-own ("LTO") and retail purchase solutions of furniture, appliances, electronics, and other home goods across its brands: Aaron's, BrandsMart U.S.A., BrandsMart Leasing, and Woodhaven Furniture Industries ("Woodhaven"). Aaron’s offers a direct-to-consumer lease-to-own solution through its 1,266 Company-operated and franchised stores in 47 states and Canada, as well as its e-commerce platform. BrandsMart U.S.A. is one of the leading appliance retailers in the country with ten retail stores in Florida and Georgia. BrandsMart Leasing offers lease-to-own solutions to customers of BrandsMart U.S.A. Woodhaven is the Company's furniture manufacturing division. 
On April 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously announced transaction to acquire 100% ownership of Interbond Corporation of America, doing business as BrandsMart U.S.A. The Company paid total consideration of approximately $230 million in cash under the terms of the agreement and additional amounts for working capital adjustments and transaction related fees.
Management believes that the acquisition will strengthen the Company's ability to deliver on its mission of enhancing people’s lives by providing easy access to high quality furniture, appliances, electronics, and other home goods through affordable lease to own and retail purchase options. Management also believes that value creation opportunities include leveraging the Company's LTO expertise to provide BrandsMart U.S.A.'s customers enhanced payment options and offering a wider selection of products to millions of Aaron’s customers, as well as generating procurement savings and other cost synergies.
The following table presents store count by ownership type:

Strategic Priorities
Our management team is committed to executing against the following multi-year strategic priorities to further transform and grow the overall business:
•Transform the Aaron's Business
•Align the Aaron's Store Footprint to our Customer Opportunity – We continue to invest in our market strategy capabilities to make better-informed, evidence-driven decisions around store location and the optimization of operating expenses. We regularly review our Aaron's real estate portfolio, which we expect will increase profitability through repositioning, remodeling, and consolidating our existing stores via our next-generation store concept ("GenNext"). The GenNext store concept features include larger showrooms and/or re-engineered store layouts, updated signage, expanded product assortment, enhanced technology-enabled shopping and checkout, and an innovative operating model. We've also enhanced our market optimization strategy with a new "Hub and Showroom" model which leverages existing infrastructure to more efficiently serve markets by combining servicing capabilities of multiple stores into a "hub" store while converting other nearby stores into "showrooms" that focus on sales activities.
We expect that our market optimization program, together with our aarons.com e-commerce platform and increased use of technology to better serve our customers, will enable us to reduce store operating costs and 
lower working capital requirements while continuing to better serve our existing markets, as well as attract new customers and expand into new markets in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we have 211 GenNext stores in our portfolio with plans to open up to an additional 50 GenNext concept stores during 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had 29 showrooms and plan to convert up to 100 showrooms per year, starting in 2023. 
•Promote our Value Proposition to Retain and Attract New Customers to our Brand – We continue to invest in e-commerce, innovative marketing campaigns, and our lease decisioning and digital platforms to illustrate our value proposition to new and existing customers. Such initiatives and investments include: 
◦Making investments to drive growth and consumer traffic through our e-commerce customer acquisition channel by investing in enhancements that provide a fully transactional, mobile, and seamless shopping experience that includes broader product selections, all of which are intended to attract newer and younger customers.
◦Utilizing a broad spectrum of traditional and digital bilingual marketing communications, ranging from direct mail, social media, display, and local market media, all allowing us to customize messages around price, value, and payment flexibility. The Company is also increasing its local marketing and promotional focus on weekly payment offerings to attract more customers and gain market share.
◦Continuing investments in lease decisioning and other digital platforms that allow us to optimize lease portfolio performance through analytics and machine learning. Other digital investments, aimed at enhancing the customer's experience include digital payment and servicing platforms.
•Enhance and Grow BrandsMart
•Achieve Transaction Synergies - We continue to make progress in executing our synergy initiatives in connection with the acquisition of BrandsMart U.S.A. in order to drive meaningful value-creation opportunities for the Company. These initiatives include:
◦The deployment of a new "in-house" lease-to-own solution which is now available at BrandsMart's stores ("BrandsMart Leasing"),
◦Offering a wide selection of BrandsMart's product assortment to Aaron's customers through the aarons.com e-commerce platform, and
◦Leveraging complementary purchasing capabilities and increased scale to generate direct procurement savings across both businesses.
•Grow Addressable Market - The acquisition of BrandsMart U.S.A. broadens our customer reach and significantly expands our total addressable market. Our BrandsMart growth initiatives include:
◦Capturing share in adjacent geographic markets by opening new BrandsMart stores. Over the next three years, we expect to open 1-2 new stores per year starting in 2023, and one new outlet center by the end of 2025.
◦Making investments to drive growth and consumer traffic through our e-commerce customer acquisition channel by investing in enhancements to the online shopping experience through website redesign, expanded product selection, and enhanced digital marketing strategies that drive customer traffic. 
•Enterprise Initiatives
•Strengthen Operational Efficiencies and Optimize Cost Structure - During the third quarter of 2022, the Company initiated an operational efficiency and optimization restructuring program intended to reduce the Company’s overall costs. This program includes the expansion of the hub and showroom model to optimize labor in markets, store labor realignments, optimization of the Company's supply chain, the centralization and optimization of store support center, operations, and multi-unit store oversight functions, as well as other reductions in real estate and third party spend. Management believes that implementing this program will help the Company sharpen its operational focus, optimize its cost profile, allocate capital resources towards long-term strategic objectives, and generate incremental value for shareholders.
•Further environmental, social, and governance initiatives ("ESG") – We continue to invest in building a people-focused workplace culture and in opportunities to make a positive impact on the environment and the communities where our customers and team members live and work. To do this, we continue to enhance our compliance, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, diversity and inclusion, and environmental 
management programs and have developed roadmaps for enhancing these programs in 2023 and beyond. Also, in 2022 we conducted assessments for our safety and environmental management programs and developed roadmaps for continued maturity of these programs in 2023 and beyond. During 2022, we hired a Senior Director of Diversity and Inclusion to lead the implementation of our vision and strategy for this critical program, and we hired a Senior Director of Corporate Affairs responsible for the daily management of our overall ESG initiatives. Additionally, in 2022 we adopted an Environmental Policy that establishes Aaron’s commitment to environmental compliance and to environmentally sustainable business operations and which also serves as the centerpiece of our environmental compliance and performance programs. Also, in 2022, the Company adopted a Human Rights Policy that affirms our commitment to operating our business in a manner that recognizes the importance of human rights both locally and abroad. Finally, we remain committed to contributing at least 1% of our annual, consolidated pre-tax profits to help build stronger communities. We expect these initiatives to continue improving the sustainability of Aaron’s.
Business Segments
For all periods prior to April 1, 2022, the Company only had one operating and reportable segment. Effective as of April 1, 2022 and in connection with the acquisition of BrandsMart U.S.A., the Company updated its reportable segments to align with the current organizational structure and the operating results that the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources, which includes two operating and reportable segments: the Aaron's Business and BrandsMart, along with an Unallocated Corporate category for remaining unallocated costs. The Company has retroactively adjusted, for all periods presented, its segment disclosures to align with the current composition of reportable segments.
The Aaron's Business segment is comprised of (i) Aaron's branded Company-operated and franchise-operated stores; (ii) aarons.com e-commerce platform ("aarons.com"); (iii) Woodhaven; and (iv) BrandsMart Leasing (collectively, the "Aaron’s Business"). 
The retail store and e-commerce operations of BrandsMart U.S.A. (excluding BrandsMart Leasing) comprise the BrandsMart segment (collectively, "BrandsMart").
Aaron’s Business Segment
Since its founding in 1955, Aaron's has been committed to serving the overlooked and underserved customer with a dedication to inclusion and improving the communities in which it operates. Through a portfolio of approximately 1,275 stores and its aarons.com e-commerce platform, Aaron's, together with its franchisees, provide consumers with LTO and retail purchase solutions for the products they need and want, with a focus on providing its customers with unparalleled customer service, high approval rates, lease plan flexibility, and an attractive value proposition, including competitive monthly payments and total cost of ownership, as compared to other LTO providers.
Woodhaven manufactures and supplies a significant portion of the upholstered furniture leased and sold in Company-operated and franchised Aaron's stores. 
Launched in 2022, BrandsMart Leasing offers LTO purchase solutions to customers of BrandsMart U.S.A.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 1,034 Company-operated stores in 43 states and Canada, and 232 independently-owned franchised stores in 35 states and Canada.
BrandsMart Segment
Founded in 1977, BrandsMart U.S.A. is one of the leading appliance and consumer electronics retailers in the southeast United States ("U.S.") and one of the largest appliance retailers in the country with ten stores in Florida and Georgia and a growing e-commerce presence on brandsmartusa.com. The operations of BrandsMart U.S.A. (other than BrandsMart Leasing) comprise the BrandsMart segment.
The Company's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022 include the results of BrandsMart subsequent to the April 1, 2022 acquisition date.
The operating results of our reportable segment may be found in (i) Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Description of 2020 Spin-off Transaction
On October 16, 2020, management of Aaron’s, Inc. finalized the formation of a new holding company structure in anticipation of the separation and distribution transaction described below. Under the holding company structure, Aaron’s, Inc. became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed company, Aaron’s Holdings Company, Inc. Aaron's, Inc. was subsequently converted to a limited liability company ("Aaron’s, LLC") holding the assets and liabilities historically associated with the historical Aaron's Business segment. Upon completion of the holding company formation, Aaron’s Holdings Company, Inc. became the publicly traded parent company of the Progressive Leasing segment ("Progressive Leasing"), the historical Aaron’s Business segment, and Vive segment ("Vive").
On November 30, 2020 (the "separation and distribution date"), Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc. completed the previously announced separation of the Aaron's Business segment (the "Pre-Spin Aaron's Business") from Progressive Leasing and Vive and changed its name to PROG Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as "PROG Holdings" or "Former Parent"). The separation of the Pre-Spin Aaron's Business was affected through a distribution (the "separation", the "separation and distribution", or the "spin-off transaction") of all outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed company called The Aaron's Company, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("the Company"), to the PROG Holdings shareholders of record as of November 27, 2020. Upon the separation and distribution, Aaron's, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Aaron's Company. Shareholders of PROG Holdings received one share of The Aaron's Company common stock for every two shares of PROG Holdings' common stock. Upon completion of the separation and distribution transaction, The Aaron's Company, Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company under the ticker "AAN" on the New York Stock Exchange. References to PROG Holdings may refer to Aaron's, Inc. or Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc. for transactions, events, and obligations prior to the separation and distribution date or PROG Holdings, Inc. for transactions, events, and obligations of PROG Holdings at or subsequent to the separation and distribution date.
Competitive Assets
We have a unique set of physical and intangible assets developed over decades in the retail and LTO market, which are difficult, expensive, and time consuming to replicate. We have developed a comprehensive strategy to leverage these assets including the following:
•Our Aaron's brand and physical presence in over 650 markets – With nearly 70 years in business, Aaron's is recognized nationwide as a leader in the LTO marketplace. This brand recognition has led to an approximate 64% repeat customer rate for the new leases we enter into, and as of December 31, 2022, our Company-operated and franchised stores had approximately 1.0 million customers with active leases. We believe that having delivery trucks located throughout our network enables us to successfully serve diverse markets including rural, suburban, and urban markets, helping mitigate the impact of local economic disruptions resulting from specific industry economic cycles, weather, and other disruptive events.
•Industry leading technology and analytics at the Aaron's Business – The Company has invested in technology to improve the customer experience and its operational execution. These investments include platforms for enhanced data analytics, data-enabled lease decisioning, digital customer onboarding, centralized payment processing and an e-commerce website that allows the customer to review and select merchandise, complete the lease application and, if approved, complete the LTO agreement and make lease payments on-line. Our technology-enabled platforms simplify the transaction and provide customers with enhanced transparency and flexibility throughout their lease, and provide management with information needed to optimize the financial performance of the business.
•BrandsMart U.S.A.'s competitive pricing and strong brand recognition – BrandsMart U.S.A.'s best in class pricing, broad product assortment and strong storefront presence and brand awareness within the Florida and Georgia markets positions the brand to thrive among its competitors.
•Management teams with deep industry experience and customer relationships – The Company's Aaron's branded stores are managed by a group of tenured managers and multi-unit leaders who have deep knowledge of the LTO transaction, as well as experience with our overlooked and underserved customer base. Our high levels of customer service within the Aaron's Business are enhanced by years of relationship building and LTO industry experience that is hard to replicate. Our average management tenure for the Aaron's Business operations is as follows: 8 years for store managers; 11 years for regional managers; 18 years for divisional vice presidents; and 24 years for our Chief Store Operations Officer. The Company's BrandsMart stores are managed by a group of tenured managers who have deep knowledge of retail operations. Our average management tenure for the BrandsMart operations is as follows: 26 years for general managers; 20 years for store managers; and 27 years for vice presidents of key functional areas.
•Last-mile, reverse logistics and refurbishment capabilities – Through both the Aaron's and BrandsMart businesses we are able to offer our customers prompt delivery, in-home set-up, product repair or replacement services, and reverse logistics (with respect to the Aaron's business) for the products our customers obtain from us. Our Aaron's stores also 
include refurbishment operations for returned merchandise, allowing us to provide pre-leased products for lease or sales in our stores and maximize lease merchandise utilization. We have approximately 2,100 delivery trucks located throughout our Aaron's Business network enabling us to provide last-mile and reverse logistics capabilities in our markets. While BrandsMart product deliveries are primarily outsourced through third-party logistics firms, each BrandsMart store has approximately three to five trucks to assist with delivery, installation, and servicing of product. 
•In-house upholstered furniture manufacturing – Under our Woodhaven Furniture Industries ("Woodhaven") manufacturing division, we have the capacity to manufacture approximately 1.1 million furniture units per year, utilizing over 738,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in five primary furniture facilities. In-house manufacturing provides control over quality and construction, fast response to changing customer tastes and market trends, reduced inventory fulfillment lead times, and mitigation of inventory supply disruptions.
Operations
Aaron's Business Omni-channel Operations
We are committed to providing our customers with an exceptional omni-channel platform which includes an in-store and on-line shopping experience that allows Aaron’s to engage customers in ways that are convenient and preferable for them. This platform includes a digital guided experience of the customer's LTO transaction through data-enabled lease decisioning, digital servicing and payment options, as well as a digitally streamlined shopping experience on our e-commerce website, aarons.com. aarons.com allows customers to shop over 7,000+ products, apply for a lease, complete the lease transaction, and access on-line self-service of lease payments and account management. Additionally, our technology-driven Inside Sales Program is designed to help potential customers find the products they are seeking and assist them through the lease process. As a result of our technology-enabled omni-channel strategy, we are attracting new and younger customers to our brand, and many of the aarons.com transactions come from individuals who previously had not shopped at Aaron's.
As of December 31, 2022, we have stores located in 47 states and Canada, and our portfolio is comprised of 1,034 company-operated locations and 232 franchised locations, which are owned and operated by independent franchisees on a licensed basis. We have developed a distinctive store concept including specific merchandising standards, store designs, and flexible payment options, all designed to appeal to our customer base. Our typical store layout is a combination of showroom, customer service and warehouse space, generally comprising 6,000 to 15,000 square feet. Our GenNext store concept generally features larger showrooms and/or re-engineered store layouts, increased product selection, technology-enabled shopping and checkout, and a refined operating model. Most stores have at least two trucks for prompt last-mile delivery, service and return of product. We've also enhanced our market optimization strategy with a new Hub and Showroom model which leverages existing infrastructure to more efficiently serve markets by combining servicing capabilities of multiple stores into a "hub" store while converting other nearby stores into "showrooms" that focus on sales activities. 
We have various levels of leadership that oversee our business operations, including divisional vice presidents and regional managers. At the individual store level, the general manager is primarily responsible for managing and supervising all aspects of store operations, including (a) customer relations and account management, (b) deliveries and pickups, (c) warehouse and inventory management, (d) merchandise selection, (e) employment decisions, including hiring, training, and terminating store team members, and (f) certain marketing initiatives. General managers also administer the process of returning merchandise including making determinations with respect to inspection, product repair or replacement, sales, reconditioning and subsequent re-leasing.
We use management information systems to facilitate customer orders, lease renewal payments, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Substantially all of our stores are network-linked directly to corporate headquarters enabling us to monitor single store performance on a daily basis. This network system assists the general manager in (a) tracking merchandise on the showroom floor and warehouse, (b) minimizing delivery times, (c) assisting with product purchasing, and (d) matching customer needs with available inventory.
By leveraging our investments in technology, including aarons.com, data-enabled lease decisioning, and our omni-channel customer service and payment platforms, we believe that we can serve our existing markets through a more efficient store portfolio while continuing to provide the high level of service our customers expect. 
BrandsMart Operations
Our BrandsMart store operations are committed to providing our customers with best-in-class pricing and a broad product assortment, which, along with our dedicated and knowledgeable sales team members, drives a positive customer service experience that differentiates BrandsMart from other retailers. BrandsMart's omni-channel platform includes an in-store and online shopping experience that allows BrandsMart U.S.A. to engage customers in ways that are convenient and preferable for them. This platform includes streamlined shopping experiences on the BrandsMart e-commerce website, brandsmartusa.com, which allows customers to shop over 6,000+ products, access product ratings and reviews, compare prices and opt for direct 
shipping or same or next day in-store pick-up. Site visitors are also able to sign up for our membership program to access competitive member pricing.
As of December 31, 2022, we have ten BrandsMart U.S.A. stores across Florida and Georgia. Our BrandsMart stores average approximately 100,000 square feet, with a combination of showroom and warehouse space. While BrandsMart product deliveries are primarily outsourced through third-party logistics firms, each BrandsMart store has approximately three to five trucks to assist with delivery, installation, and servicing of product. 
We have various levels of leadership that oversee our BrandsMart business operations. At the individual store level, employee salesperson success is driven by a predominantly commission-based compensation structure. The store layout is designed such that each product category is segregated as a department, which allows for dedicated sales managers with specific product knowledge to oversee each department. Each store also typically has at least two store managers to assist with and oversee operational and sales efforts. The store general manager is primarily responsible for managing and supervising all aspects of store operations, and BrandsMart's Chief Operations Officer and Chief of Staff is responsible for managing the seamless operations of all stores and the supporting store support center functions. 
BrandsMart Leasing
Launched in 2022, BrandsMart Leasing is an in-house LTO purchase solution that is offered to customers of BrandsMart U.S.A. In addition to traditional credit offerings, BrandsMart U.S.A. customers have the option to apply for an LTO plan through BrandsMart Leasing, which provides the option to acquire ownership of merchandise through a renewable LTO plan, usually 12 to 18 months, typically by making weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease renewal payments. BrandsMart Leasing is supported by proprietary centralized lease decisioning technology, described further below.
Lease Agreement Approval and Decisioning
Our lease decisioning platforms are core to managing the risk of our LTO portfolio. We have developed proprietary lease approval processes with respect to our Aaron's and BrandsMart Leasing operations through a fully automated technology-driven algorithm-enabled centralized digital decisioning platform, which is designed to improve our customer experience by streamlining and standardizing the lease decisioning process and shortening transaction times. Customers receive lease approval decisions either on-line at aarons.com enabling them to shop on aarons.com, at apply aarons.com to shop with approval in hand at an Aaron's retail location, or by applying in-store at a BrandsMart U.S.A. store location. Our lease decisioning platforms have allowed us to optimize approval rates, lease payment amounts, full ownership conversions, write-offs, and revenue outcomes. We believe continuous innovation and frequent enhancements to our lease decisioning platforms is competitively advantageous.
At the core of the lease decisioning platforms are the Aaron's lease decisioning models. Our model development efforts utilize modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. We utilize a multitude of traditional and alternative data sources in the model training process in an effort to maximize the predictive power of the decisioning models, while working with appropriate internal and external resources to assure compliant and consistent results. The combination of modern data science techniques and a wide breadth of data produces models that are capable of analyzing lease applications immediately to produce decisions in real time for each lease application.
The second pillar of our lease decisioning platforms is a robust set of post-model processes that determine the appropriate lease amounts or product approvals depending on the risk associated with the lease application. Higher scored applications are eligible for larger lease payments and thus a broader range of merchandise categories. 
Lastly, our lease decisioning platforms includes fraud prevention processes. Our fraud prevention processes focus on identity and the digital file associated with lease applications. To reduce our synthetic fraud risk exposure, we evaluate risks associated with emails, phones, and devices used in an application. Depending on the fraud risk level of each lease application, we may employ automated knowledge-based authentication. We believe this authentication reduces our fraud risk while still offering a streamlined lease application experience for the consumer.
We continue to enhance our decisioning capabilities by adopting an iterative "test and learn" approach and expect that we will continue to drive positive outcomes through incremental enhancements. Franchised stores have also implemented this data-enabled decisioning platform in their stores. In addition to utilizing this decisioning platform, Aaron's stores may occasionally complete the lease approval process by verifying the applicant’s employment, or other reliable sources of income, and using personal references, which was the approval method used by our stores prior to the implementation of our data-enabled digital decisioning platform and is used in our Canadian operated stores. 
Merchandising
The Aaron's Business and BrandsMart operations employ a merchandising strategy that spans three primary key product categories: furniture, home appliances and electronics. We have long-term relationships with many well-known and aspirational brands, including Samsung®, LG®, Whirlpool®, Apple® and GE®, HP®, JBL®, and Ashley®. We purchase merchandise directly from manufacturers and local distributors at competitive prices. One of our largest suppliers is our own Woodhaven Furniture Industries manufacturing division, which supplies a significant portion of the upholstered furniture leased and sold in the Aaron's branded Company-operated and franchised stores and which we have introduced in certain BrandsMart U.S.A. stores. In recent years, we have strategically focused on growing the revenue contribution of certain merchandise categories to align with macro-economic expansion in these categories and attract new customers. In addition, we continue to increase our product offerings through expanded assortment on aarons.com and brandsmartusa.com, our e-commerce shopping platforms. 
The following table shows the percentage of our Aaron's Business segment revenues attributable to different merchandise categories:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Aaron's Business Merchandise Category | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Furniture | 41 | % | | 43 | % | 44 | %
Appliances | 31 | % | | 31 | % | 29 | %
Consumer Electronics | 25 | % | | 23 | % | 24 | %
Other | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %

The following table shows the percentage of our BrandsMart segment revenues attributable to different merchandise categories:

 | Year Ended December 31,
BrandsMart Merchandise Category | 2022 
Appliances | 55 | %
Consumer Electronics | 35 | %
Other | 10 | %

Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing efforts target previous, existing, and potential new customers through a variety of traditional and digital media channels including on-line search, TV, radio, digital video, and direct mail, with a combination of brand and promotional messaging. We continue to test new ways to engage potential customers and identify audience segments that find our retail and LTO options appealing. Given BrandsMart's storefront presence and strong brand awareness and recognition within the Florida and Georgia markets, regional marketing strategies are effective in appealing to BrandsMart's audience segments. 
With our fast-growing Aaron's and BrandsMart e-commerce businesses, we focus heavily on digital marketing including search, display, and social media to help drive traffic to both stores and our e-commerce websites. Our e-commerce marketing is dynamically managed on a daily basis and is growing as a share of spend relative to traditional marketing channels.
We continue to refine and expand our overall contact strategy to grow our consolidated customer base. We test various types of advertising and marketing campaigns and strategies, analyze the results of those tests and, based on our learnings, refine those campaigns and strategies to attempt to maximize their effectiveness with current and potential customers. By understanding optimal offers and products to promote to current and former customers, along with potential prospects, we look to continue improvements in marketing return on investment. With respect to existing customers, direct mail and email serve as the primary tools we utilize in our marketing strategies. With respect to marketing to potential customers, our primary tools currently include digital, direct mail, and traditional broadcast and search advertising.
Franchising
As of December 31, 2022, we had 57 franchisees, who operate a total of 232 Aaron's franchised store locations. We have existing agreements with our current franchisees to govern the operations of franchised stores. Our standard agreement is for a term of 10 years, with one ten-year renewal option, and requires our franchisees to operate in compliance with our policies and procedures. In collaboration with our franchisees, we are able to refine, further develop and test operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that we believe will ultimately benefit our company-operated stores. Franchisees are obligated to remit to us royalty payments of 6% of the weekly cash revenue collections from their stores.
From time to time, we may enter into franchise agreements with new franchisees or purchase store locations from our 
franchisees. We have purchased 306 store locations from our franchisees since January 1, 2017. We have not entered into a franchise agreement with a new franchisee in more than five years. We will continue to assess opportunities to both acquire existing franchise locations and franchise new markets that we wish to develop.
Some qualifying franchisees took part in a financing arrangement we established with several financial institutions to assist our existing franchisees in establishing and operating their store(s). Under that arrangement, which was originally established in 1994, we provide guarantees to the financial institutions that provide the loan facilities for amounts outstanding under this franchise financing program. On December 31, 2022, the maximum amount that the Company would be obligated to repay in the event franchisees defaulted was $6.3 million, all of which would be due within the next two years. However, due to franchisee borrowing limits, we believe any losses associated with defaults would be substantially mitigated through recovery of lease merchandise and other assets. Since the inception of the franchise loan program in 1994, the Company's losses associated with the program have been immaterial. The Company believes that any future amounts to be funded by the Company in connection with these guarantees will be immaterial.
Manufacturing
Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our domestic manufacturing division, was established in 1982. Woodhaven consists of five furniture facilities totaling approximately 738,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities help to ensure that during periods of supply chain volatility, we are better positioned to provide our stores with suitable inventory to meet customer demand. The majority of the items Woodhaven produces continue to be leased or sold through our Aaron's and BrandsMart stores, including franchised stores. However, we also manufacture and sell furniture products to other retailers.
Woodhaven is a vertically integrated operation. Vertical integration enables us to better manage product availability, quality and cost with processes that include (a) digital design, construction and rendering, as well as physical prototyping, (b) cut and sew operations to process fabric and rolled goods into covers, (c) frame mills to process 100% of our frame components with hardwood and engineered panels, (d) foam fabrication operations to control foam and fiber quality, (e) product testing to assure product standards are met, and (f) multiple locations and material sources that support our business continuity planning.
Woodhaven produces upholstered living-room furniture (including contemporary sofas, chairs and modular sofa and ottoman collections in a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics). The furniture produced by our integrated manufacturing operations incorporates features that we believe result in enhanced durability and improved shipping processes, as compared to furniture we would otherwise purchase from third parties. These features include (a) standardized components, (b) reduced number of parts and features susceptible to wear or damage, (c) more resilient foam, (d) durable fabrics and sturdy frames that translate to longer life and higher residual value, and (e) devices that allow sofas to stand on end for easier and more efficient transport. The division also provides replacement covers for all styles and fabrics of its upholstered furniture, as well as other parts, for use in reconditioning leased furniture that has been returned, so that our stores can continue to offer that furniture to our customers at a relatively low price point. 
Woodhaven is also able to generate ancillary income and right-size production by selling furniture to third parties, including large, national retailers. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 21%, 18%, and 16%, respectively, of total non-retail sales, which we define as sales of new merchandise to our franchisees and to third-party retailers, were generated by Woodhaven from sales to third-party retailers.
Lease Renewal
We continue to emphasize renewals-related compliance training, monitoring, and improvement initiatives, to ensure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations and our internal policies. One of the factors in the success of our operations is timely management of lease renewal payments, which are monitored by general managers and team members and our centralized Customer Retention team members. Customers who fail to make lease renewal payments are contacted within a few days after their renewal date to discuss arrangement for future payments in order to keep their agreements active. When we have been unable to reach the customer by telephone, we may visit those customers at their residences to encourage them to keep their agreement active or potentially return the lease merchandise. Careful attention to managing lease renewal payments is particularly important in LTO operations, where the customer has the option to cancel the agreement at the conclusion of each periodic payment term by returning the product covered by the agreement, and each contractually due payment is considered a renewal of the agreement. Approximately 89% and 87% of the payments that we collect are via payment card options such as debit and credit cards for our Aaron's Business and BrandsMart customers, respectively, which allows our store team members to be more productive and increase operational efficiencies. At the Aaron's Business, we continue to encourage customers to take advantage of the convenience of enrolling in our automatic payment program, and approximately 53% of our customer lease agreements are enrolled for automatic payments as of December 31, 2022. 
The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of consolidated lease revenues was 6.4%, 4.2% and 4.2% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Customer Success
We believe our strong focus on customer satisfaction generates repeat business and long-lasting relationships with our customers and a high likelihood that our customers will recommend the Aaron's and BrandsMart brands to friends and family. Our strong culture of customer service begins with our team members and requires that we develop skilled, empathetic team members who value our customers and who possess and project a genuine desire to understand and serve our customers’ needs. To meet this requirement, we maintain and continuously enhance a comprehensive team member development program for both new and tenured team members. This development program and our commitment to diversity and inclusion is designed to enable our team members to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for our customers as well as a compliant, consistent, and helpful customer service experience. Further details can be found within the "Human Capital Management" section below. 
At the Aaron's Business our customers receive multiple complimentary service benefits. These benefits vary according to applicable state law but generally include early purchase options, free delivery and set-up, free relocation of product to a new address within a specified geographic area, reinstatement options, product repair or replacement, access to digital tools to manage their account, and other discounts and benefits. Unlike traditional transactional retail sales, we have the unique opportunity over the span of the LTO agreement to build a closer relationship with our customers, often celebrating, assisting, and supporting them through significant moments in their lives. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 64% of the new lease agreements we entered into were with repeat customers. Customers who begin agreements on-line also have the support and service of a local store throughout the duration of the agreement.
Our Aaron's branded store-based operations also offer customers the option to obtain a membership in the Aaron’s Club Program (the "Club Program"). The benefits to customers of the Club Program are separated into three general categories: (a) lease protection benefits; (b) health & wellness discounts; and (c) dining, shopping, and consumer savings. Club Program enrollment is optional and may be canceled by the member at any time. The lease protection benefits may provide Club Program members with lease payment waivers for up to four months or a maximum of $1,000 on active customer lease agreements if the customer becomes unemployed or ill; replacement of the product if the product is stolen or damaged by an act of God; waiver of remaining lease payments on lease agreements where any member named on the lease agreement dies; and/or product repair or replacement for an extended period after the customer takes ownership. Club Program benefits vary by state. 
At BrandsMart, our customers receive a number of complimentary service benefits, including a 30-day price guarantee on most items and the ability to return or exchange eligible products within the specified return period. Customers also have access to sign-up for exclusive member benefits, which include alert notifications on sales and promotions and special financing offers. BrandsMart also offers our customers other benefits for additional costs, including delivery, installation and a product protection plan that can be purchased at the point of sale that provides extended warranty coverage on eligible product purchases. If a product under warranty needs repair, BrandsMart's service team will repair the product or work directly with the manufacturer to replace it. BrandsMart also offers repair and servicing of products that are not covered under warranty for a low cost. 
E-commerce and Store-based Operation's Distribution Channels
At the Aaron's Business, e-commerce and store businesses utilize our 15 fulfillment centers to control merchandise and offer our customers a wide product assortment. These centers average approximately 124,000 square feet, giving us approximately 1,860,000 square feet of logistics capacity outside of our network of Aaron's stores. Our BrandsMart e-commerce and store operations utilize two distribution centers for its Florida and Georgia store operations, which provide BrandsMart with approximately 900,000 square feet of logistics capacity outside of the BrandsMart U.S.A. stores. 
We believe that our network of fulfillment centers provides a strategic advantage over our competitors. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores to quickly meet customer demand and effectively manage inventory levels. Most of our contiguous U.S. stores are within a 250-mile radius of a fulfillment center, facilitating timely shipment of products to the stores and fast delivery of orders to customers.
We realize freight savings and inventory productivity through centralized distribution of merchandise by using fulfillment centers. We use various contract carriers to make deliveries weekly to our stores nationwide. A fleet of approximately 2,100 store-based delivery trucks provide industry leading heavy goods last mile delivery and reverse logistics for returned products and the servicing of products.
Human Capital Management
We believe in being an inclusive workplace for all of our team members and are committed to having a diverse workforce that is representative of the customers that choose to shop with us in-store or online and the communities in which we operate our businesses. We believe that a variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business, enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base, and reflects the communities we serve. Team members are encouraged and supported to create value and drive professional and personal growth, and we are committed to respecting each other in all 
interactions. 
On December 31, 2022, we employed 10,060 full-time and part time team members, the majority of which were full-time team members. Approximately 7,262 of our team members were Aaron's store, fulfillment center, service center or divisional/regional staff; 1,427 of our team members were BrandsMart store and warehouse staff; 369 of our team members were Woodhaven staff; and 1,002 of our team members were store support center staff supporting Aaron’s, BrandsMart, and Woodhaven. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with team members are good, driven by our commitment to listen, learn, and continually improve.

Development and Career Opportunities
We believe in attracting top talent with a competitive wage and benefits offering and retaining them by providing an environment where team members can see that their career has a clear path of growth. To help facilitate that growth, we provide tools, resources and programs that adapt and grow with our team members. Our efforts include:
•Providing all Aaron’s Business store support center team members and all Aaron's Business management access to a library of more than 16,000 third-party courses enabling the development of new skills that contribute to career growth and development. Team members consumed more than 5,300 hours of learning via this third-party platform in 2022. In addition, this learning content is scanned and reviewed internally, leading to targeted library content that focuses on topics and content areas determined to be of greatest relevance and importance to the organization;
•Delivering an in-house designed continuous learning program to avail Aaron's store team members a career path with the destination of their choosing while using custom learning solutions designed to add and confirm both competencies and proficiencies throughout all levels of their career. The learning takes a blended approach involving formal courses, self-directed learning, and on-the-job applications. In addition, the curriculum features internal experts educating and coaching others;

•Offering an employee stock purchase program for eligible Aaron's Business team members with a lookback and discount.
We strive to help team members maintain job stability so they are encouraged to stay with the Company and positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. To reduce team member turnover, we engage in surveys with team members, conduct stay interviews to help identify any issues before they cause a team member to leave the Company, and review exit interview data, hotline calls and root cause analysis to help deter turnover.
Compliance Management Program
As a company with a formal Compliance Management Program, we maintain a robust program with oversight of policy and procedures, training, third party oversight, issues management, and monitoring and testing. The Compliance Management Program fosters collaboration between line of business owners to create a culture of compliance by assisting the business owners with establishing and maintaining current policies and procedures that align with the Company’s goals, strategy, and business objectives, including adherence to applicable laws and regulations. 
We are committed to compliance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations and conduct ongoing monitoring for new laws or regulations that impact our industry, business, or operational risk. We have mechanisms in place for consumers to submit complaints or feedback.
Compliance training is completed for new hires during onboarding and supplemented with annual and periodic refresher training thereafter to reinforce core compliance principles. Our compliance training is customized to our risk profile, business strategy and operations. Training of the Board, management and other team members is essential. Our training is comprehensive and specifically tailored to the particular responsibilities of the team members receiving it. 
Under our Compliance Management Program, we are making ongoing improvements to our compliance-related policies and procedures, training, third party oversight, issues management, and testing and monitoring programs. This program is overseen by the Audit Committee as well as our management-level Compliance Committee.
Health and Safety of Team Members and Customers
Aaron's takes the safety of our team members and our customers seriously. Aaron's policies and training programs support our health and safety practices. Throughout the year, team members complete safety and compliance training relevant to their role. Completion of required safety and compliance training is closely managed to ensure that team members have the required skills and knowledge to perform safely and ethically. The following summarizes the Aaron's Business Health & Safety Program:
•Dedicated health & safety team providing program oversight and continued maturation efforts;
•Required annual and new hire formal safety training curriculum;
•Environmental, Health & Safety Audit Program for our fulfillment centers, service centers and manufacturing operations;
•Three lines of defense for safety auditing and checklist at Company operated retail stores;
•Driver qualification program;
•Continued investment in equipment and technology to provide our team members with the safest experience;
•Reporting on safety Key Performance Indicators to field and senior management regularly; and
•Oversight and governance by our Safety Committee made up of key executives and other members of management.
Our business has been, and may in the future be, impacted by COVID-19 or any related pandemic or health crisis. We continually evaluate our existing COVID-19 prevention controls and the need for different or additional controls, and conduct periodic inspections at our stores to identify unhealthy conditions, work practices, and work procedures related to COVID-19 to help ensure compliance with our COVID-19 policies and procedures. 
Labor Practices and Human Rights
All of our team members earn more than the federal minimum wage. The average hourly wage of a full-time hourly operations employee in our Company-operated stores, fulfillment and service centers, and divisional support staff, as of December 31, 2022, is $15.65, with a meaningful portion of those team members earning an average hourly wage of $16.50 or more. The average total compensation and benefits for a full-time hourly operations employee in our Company-operated stores, fulfillment -and service centers, and divisional support staff is approximately $35,000 including wages, bonuses and benefits, such as paid time off. Also, more than 97% of our Company-operated stores, fulfillment and service center, and divisional support staff team members are eligible to earn an incentive payment which allows us to meaningfully reward our high performing team members.
In addition to team member surveys and the analysis of exit interview data to deter turnover and support our team members in their job stability and growth, we maintain a Team Member Hotline, available 24 hours a day, through which team members may report (including anonymous reporting, if desired by the team member) concerns via phone or via an online portal. All reported matters are taken seriously and routed to the appropriate departments (i.e., Human Resources, Compliance, or Legal) for review, investigation, and closure after appropriate resolution. The 2022 annualized voluntary turnover rate in all corporate, stores, fulfillment centers and warehouse operations was 74%, and the 2022 annualized involuntary turnover rate in all corporate stores, fulfillment centers and warehouse operations was 33%.
The Company respects the rights of workers who offer services and create the products that we purchase from our suppliers. We communicate our expectations to provide us with safe, energy-efficient, high-quality products, and we hold our suppliers to a high standard because we strive to be an example of good human rights and labor practices throughout our business activities. We take care in the selection of our suppliers, and Aaron's also communicates its expectations on social conditions, worker safety and integrity in the workplace, and compliance with applicable laws through Aaron's Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct outlines Aaron's expectations with respect to hiring practices, forced labor, child labor, discrimination, and other labor rights. Aaron's suppliers must comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct, conduct their business with a high level of integrity, and maintain accurate records to demonstrate that compliance. Specifically, Aaron's requires its suppliers, in accordance with applicable laws, to meet the following standards per the Supplier Code of Conduct and standard terms and conditions:
•Treat all workers with dignity and respect; 
•Provide a safe, healthy, and clean work environment; 
•Provide safe and healthy housing if supplier provides residential housing for its team members; 
•Provide a discrimination, harassment, and punishment free environment; 
•Pay workers at least the minimum wage and benefits required;
•Follow minimum working hour restrictions; 
•Prohibit child labor, forced labor and human trafficking; and 
•Comply with applicable laws (including any changes from time to time). 
One of Aaron's largest suppliers is our own Woodhaven Furniture Industries manufacturing division, which supplies a significant portion of the upholstered furniture we lease or sell in Aaron's stores. All of Woodhaven's operations are based in the U.S., creating U.S. jobs, and all of the products manufactured are made in the U.S.
In December 2022, the Company adopted a Human Rights Policy that affirms our commitment to operating our business in a manner that recognizes the importance of human rights both locally and abroad. As such, the Company believes in upholding fundamental human rights and operating in compliance with human rights laws. The Company does not use or condone the use of slave labor or human trafficking. The Company also believes that team members should be treated fairly and with dignity by providing a work environment that is free from conduct that can be considered harassing, discriminatory, intimidating and/or disruptive, including sexual harassment. The Company does not tolerate harassment or discrimination and is committed to a workplace that fosters respect and dignity for all. 
From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those alleging employment discrimination or violations of wage-and-hour laws. During 2022, the total amount we paid to resolve proceedings alleging employment claims was immaterial to our earnings. In our efforts to have all team members comply with applicable employment-related laws, to drive positive workplace conduct, to strive to foster a fair and equitable workplace, and to reduce the number of employment discrimination claims brought against us, we provide a variety of resources, including diversity, non-discrimination and anti-harassment training as part of the Company’s mandatory compliance training, for all eligible Aaron's Business team members, including team members in our call centers, fulfillment and service centers, store support center, and stores. We also have a team member hotline accessible to our team members via phone or the internet so that any concerns can be investigated promptly and thoroughly.
Working Capital
Our LTO model results in us remaining the owner of merchandise on lease until the customer obtains ownership of the item; therefore, our most significant working capital asset is lease merchandise currently on lease. Our store-based and e-commerce LTO and retail operations also require us to maintain significant levels of retail and lease merchandise inventories available for lease and retail purchase to provide the service levels demanded by our customers and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such merchandise levels. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, and availability under our credit agreement is adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing at Woodhaven are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywood, oriented strand board and hardwood. All of these materials are purchased in the open market from unaffiliated sources. We have a diverse base of suppliers; therefore, we are not dependent on any single supplier. The sourcing of raw materials from our suppliers is not overly dependent on any particular country. While we have not had any material interruptions in our manufacturing operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages and current macroeconomic 
conditions impacting the pricing and availability of raw materials, there can be no assurances that disruptions to our supply of raw materials will not become more significant, or that the costs of those raw materials will not increase significantly, going forward due to inflation and the adverse impacts of the pandemic.
Seasonality
Our revenue mix for the Aaron's Business is moderately seasonal. The first quarter of each year generally has higher lease renewal rates and corresponding lease revenues than any other quarter. Our customers will also more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise during the first quarter of the year. We believe that each is primarily due to the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. In addition, lease portfolio size typically increases gradually in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season. We expect these trends to continue in future periods.
Due to the seasonality of our business and the extent of the impact of additional government stimulus, and/or enhanced unemployment benefits to our customers in response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, results for any quarter or period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
Discussion regarding seasonality trends for BrandsMart will be included when prior year comparable periods are included in the financial results.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market with competition from national, regional and local operators of direct-to-consumer LTO stores and websites, virtual LTO companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs, point of sale financing, and title or installment lending), traditional and on-line sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. We also compete with retail stores for customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service, payment amounts, store location and terms, as well as total cost of merchandise ownership, the number and frequency of payments in lease ownership plans, and other factors.
The Lease-to-Own Business Model
The LTO model offers customers an attractive alternative to traditional methods of purchasing furniture, appliances, electronics, computers and a variety of other products and accessories. In a standard LTO transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise through a renewable LTO plan, usually 12 to 24 months, typically by making weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease renewal payments. The customer also has the option to cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to the lessor and only making payments required for the accrued lease period. If the customer renews the lease for each periodic renewal period through the completion of the lease ownership plan, they then obtain ownership of the item. In addition, LTO transactions typically include early ownership options, free delivery and in-home set-up of the merchandise, free repairs for defective merchandise, and other benefits.
An LTO agreement provides flexibility, affordable payments, and no long-term commitment, and is available to all customers who are approved, including those who are credit challenged. Other consumers who find the LTO model appealing are those who have a temporary need for merchandise, those who want to try a product at home before committing to the full cost of ownership, and those who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt. We believe the LTO value proposition results in high customer loyalty and repeat purchase behavior, which reduces customer acquisition costs and improves customer lifetime value.
LTO businesses benefit from relatively stable, renewable lease revenues and predictable cash flows provided by pools of lease agreements originated in prior periods. Our renewable lease revenue streams help insulate the business in times of macro-economic disruption and reduce reliance on current period sales and customer traffic for cash flows as compared to other retailing models. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 68% of the Company's total revenue was generated from recurring revenue streams related to our contracted lease payments.
Our Market Opportunity
Our Aaron's Business core customer base is principally comprised of overlooked and underserved consumers in the U.S. and Canada with limited access to traditional credit sources. According to Fair Isaacs Corporation, more than 100 million people in the U.S. either have no credit score or have a score below 650. Historically, during economic downturns, our customer base expands due to tightened credit underwriting by banks and credit card issuers, as well as employment-related factors which may impact customers’ ability to otherwise purchase products from traditional retailers using cash or traditional financing sources. We have Aaron's stores strategically located in over 650 markets across the U.S. and Canada and are within five miles of 42.9% of U.S. households. Our stores are designed and merchandised to appeal to customers across different types of markets, including urban, suburban, and rural markets.
BrandsMart U.S.A. is the low-price leader and retailer of choice for consumers looking to purchase appliances, consumer electronics, and other household goods in the key markets we serve, primarily south Florida and Georgia. We believe our competitive position in both price and selection is a meaningful differentiator in attracting new and repeat customers from across the income and credit spectrum.
Government Regulation
Our LTO operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, lease disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain lease renewal and collection procedures.
Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the LTO transaction. Federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of the business including matters such as renewal activity, marketing disclosures to customers and customer contact may be subject to federal laws, regulation, and/or oversight by federal regulators.
There has been increased legislative and regulatory attention in the U.S., at both the federal and state levels, on financial services products offered to near-prime and subprime consumers in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the LTO industry. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be enacted and what the impact would be on us.
Additional regulations at both the state and federal level are under consideration, as the attention placed on financial services products and consumer debt transactions, including consumer debt collection practices, has grown significantly. For instance, certain changes have been proposed to federal bankruptcy law that may result in a change to the treatment of an LTO transaction to one where the lessor is treated as an unsecured creditor for bankruptcy purposes. If enacted, such treatment would likely impact our ability to obtain payment or a return of our merchandise for customers who file bankruptcy.
We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Federal regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on the subprime financial and credit-restricted marketplace within which much of our LTO customer base obtains products and services. Any of these agencies may propose and adopt new regulations, or interpret existing regulations, in a manner that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. In addition, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance.
From time to time, federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general have directed investigations or regulatory initiatives toward the LTO industry, or toward certain companies within the industry.
In addition to federal regulatory oversight, currently, nearly every state and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate LTO transactions via state or provincial statutes, including states and provinces in which we currently operate our stores. Most LTO laws require LTO companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, the amount and timing of each 
payment, the total amount of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state LTO laws may limit the retail price for an item, the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that LTO companies may charge on LTO transactions, generally defining "cost-of-rental" as the amount paid for lease ownership in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our LTO transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the various state LTO laws.
