 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 Haynes International, Inc. (“Haynes”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is one of the world’s largest producers of high‑performance nickel‑ and cobalt‑based alloys in flat product form such as sheet, coil and plate forms. The Company is focused on developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing technologically advanced, high‑performance alloys, which are sold primarily in the aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries. The Company’s products consist of high‑temperature resistant alloys, or HTA products, and corrosion‑resistant alloys, or CRA products. HTA products are used by manufacturers of equipment that is subjected to extremely high temperatures, such as jet engines for the aerospace market, gas turbine engines used for power generation and industrial heating equipment. CRA products are used in applications that require resistance to very corrosive media found in chemical processing, power plant emissions control and hazardous waste treatment. Management believes Haynes is one of the principal producers of high‑performance alloy flat products in sheet, coil and plate forms, and sales of these forms, in the aggregate, represented approximately 58% of net product revenues in fiscal 2019. The Company also produces its products as seamless and welded tubulars, and in slab, bar, billet and wire forms.
 The Company has significant manufacturing facilities in Kokomo, Indiana; Arcadia, Louisiana; and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility specializes in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility specializes in wire products. The Company’s products are sold primarily through its direct sales organization, which includes 12 service and/or sales centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. All of these centers are Company‑operated. In fiscal 2019, approximately 75% of the Company’s net revenue was generated by its direct sales organization, and the remaining 25% was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents that supplement its direct sales efforts primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia, some of whom have been associated with the Company for over 30 years.

 The Company’s goal is to grow its business by increasing revenues, profitability and cash flow while continuing to be its customers’ provider of choice for high-performance alloys and value-added processes. This goal is pursued within the overarching goal of safety, which is a core priority. The Company has launched and implemented a series of focus initiatives designed to continue to improve safety and to unlock the potential of the Company by increasing volumes, improving targeted pricing and relentlessly pursuing reduced costs. This includes effectively utilizing open capacity on major assets and managing mix at constrained assets.
 The following are some examples of strategic focus initiatives that are currently being undertaken.

· | Increasing prices to ensure the Company is compensated for the high-value differentiated products and services it provides. The Company is adjusting pricing in a number of high-value products especially in high-temperature applications. This includes spot pricing, mill lead- time products and long-term customer agreements when they renew. These price increases are beyond raw material increases, thus they contribute

This ongoing pursuit is significant and includes initiatives in many different areas such as material management, productivity enhancements, yield & efficiency improvements and outsourcing costs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase revenues by inventing new alloys, developing new applications for existing alloys and expanding into new markets. The Company believes that it is an industry leader in developing new alloys designed to meet its customers’ specialized and demanding requirements. The Company continues to work closely with customers and end users of its products to identify, develop and manufacture new high-performance alloys. Since fiscal 2003, the Company’s technical programs have yielded nine new proprietary alloys with multiple applications, an accomplishment that the Company believes distinguishes it from its competitors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Developing new applications for existing alloys is also a key strength and strategy of the Company. The Company leverages its technical expertise to develop unique applications for its products, especially proprietary and specialty alloys that can yield higher margins. These new applications, including use in unique special projects and new content programs are an important part of the Company’s growth strategy.
 Through development of new alloys and new applications for existing alloys, the Company is seeking to participate in additional markets in order to generate new revenue streams beyond the core markets of aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries. The Company believes that the synthetic natural gas, renewable energy, clean-coal, waste-to-energy, oil and gas, flue-gas desulfurization, automotive, consumer electronics, heat treatment, medical and nuclear industries all present possible opportunities for its products.

· | Increase revenues by providing value-added processing services and leveraging the Company’s global distribution network. The Company believes that its network of service and sales centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia distinguishes it from its competitors, many of whom operate only mills. The Company’s service and sales centers enable it to develop close customer relationships through direct interaction with customers and to respond to customer orders quickly, while also providing value-added cutting services such as laser, plasma and water-jet cutting. These services allow the Company’s customers to minimize their processing costs and outsource non-core activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to expand the maintenance, repair and overhaul business. The Company believes that its maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, business represents both an expanding and recurring revenue stream. Products used in the Company’s end markets require periodic replacement due to the extreme environments in which they are used, which drives demand for recurring MRO work. The Company intends to continue to leverage the capabilities of its service and sales centers to respond quickly to its customers’ time-sensitive MRO needs to develop new and retain existing business opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase profitability through strategic acquisitions and alliances. The Company will continue to examine opportunities that enable it to enhance shareholder value. These opportunities may include product line additions, market expansion opportunities or other synergies. The Company will also continue to evaluate strategic relationships with third parties in the industry in order to enhance its competitive position and relationships with customers.

 Company History
 The Company was founded in 1912 as Haynes Stellite Works by American inventor and entrepreneur Elwood Haynes in Kokomo, Indiana. Since its founding, the Company has continuously conducted its main operations in Kokomo, Indiana. The Company was owned for much of its history by corporate parents, including Union Carbide and Cabot Corporation, until purchased in 1989 and then again in 1997 by private equity firms. The debt incurred in the last leveraged buy‑out ultimately forced the Company into bankruptcy in March 2004, from which it emerged five months later in August 2004.
 The Company began operations in its tubular facility in Arcadia, Louisiana over 30 years ago. This facility and the Company’s tubular product business have grown with additional investment over time. The Company operates service centers in the U.S. many of which include value-added operations with laser, water-jet and plasma cutting.  The Company also acquired a stainless steel and high‑temperature alloy wire company located in Mountain Home, North Carolina in 2005. The Company primarily produces high‑performance alloy wire at that facility.  Most recently, in January 2015, the Company acquired assets in LaPorte, Indiana enabling coil stretching, leveling, slitting and cut-to-length operations.  The Laporte operation also includes a toll processing business.  The Company expanded the Laporte facility and moved operations from Lebanon, Indiana to that facility.  In addition, the Company has expanded globally with service center locations in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and China and other sales offices in France, Japan, Singapore and Italy.
 In March 2007, the Company completed a public equity offering, and simultaneously the Company listed its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. The Company began paying a dividend in fiscal 2010 and raised the dividend at the beginning of fiscal 2012.
 Products
 The global specialty alloy market consists of three primary sectors: stainless steel, general-purpose nickel alloys and high‑performance nickel‑ and cobalt‑based alloys. The Company believes that the high‑performance alloy sector represents less than 10% of the total alloy market. The Company competes primarily in the high‑performance nickel‑ and cobalt‑based alloy sectors, which includes HTA products and CRA products. In each year of fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, HTA products accounted for approximately 81%, 81% and 80% of the Company’s net revenues, and sales of the Company’s CRA products accounted for approximately 19%, 19% and 20% of the Company’s net revenues.  These percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the Company to its foreign subsidiaries, but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers. Management believes, however, that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section.
 High‑temperature Resistant Alloys. HTA products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines. Stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace‑related market applications for HTA products. However, once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market, it tends to remain in use for extended periods. HTA products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels, electric power generation, power sources for offshore drilling platforms, gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power generators. The following table

  Corrosion‑resistant Alloys. CRA products are used in a variety of applications, such as chemical processing, power plant emissions control, hazardous waste treatment, sour gas production and pharmaceutical vessels. Historically, the chemical processing market has represented the largest end‑user sector for CRA products. Due to maintenance, safety and environmental considerations, the Company believes this market continues to represent an area of potential long‑term growth. In addition to the use of CRA products in the chemical and petrochemical processing industry, the Company has seen an increased demand for some of these alloys in applications such as gas-to-liquid and synthetic gas. For improved efficiency within relevant applications, higher operating temperatures and harsher environmental conditions are required and, as a consequence, high-temperature, corrosion-resistant alloys are used. Some of our HTA products offer excellent resistance to oxidation, sulfidation, metal dusting and other high-temperature degradation modes. The Company expects this area of the chemical and petrochemical industry to represent potential long-term growth opportunities for the HTA products. Unlike aerospace applications within the HTA product market, the development of new market applications for CRA products generally does not require long lead times. The following table sets forth information with respect to certain

  Patents and Trademarks
 The Company currently maintains a total of approximately 23 published U.S. patents and applications and approximately 291 foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products. Since fiscal 2003, the Company’s technical programs have yielded nine new proprietary alloys. 
 The alloys being commercialized saw significant further advancement in the process during fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Company believes that its alloys (particularly HAYNES® 282® alloy) are being commercialized rapidly when compared to historical trends for other proprietary alloys introduced by the Company. The Company will continue to actively promote its new alloys through customer engineering visits, technical presentations and papers.
 In the aerospace, industrial gas turbine and high temperature markets, one of the alloys that has already seen significant commercial success is HAYNES® 282® alloy. This alloy has an excellent combination of high temperature strength, formability and fabricability. There have been a significant number of customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, and for other high temperature applications. The alloy has already been specified into major aerospace and industrial gas turbine applications, as well as for certain high temperature components in the automotive and industrial applications.  Another new alloy for use in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets is HAYNES® 244® alloy. It combines high strength to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit with a low coefficient of thermal expansion.  Commercialization is ongoing for this alloy, and it has recently been specified into a major aerospace component.

 In the chemical processing industry, customers have found extensive applications for HASTELLOY® G‑35® alloy, particularly in wet phosphoric acid production. Management expects demand for this alloy will continue to grow. Commercialization is also ongoing for HASTELLOY® HYBRID‑BC1® alloy. HYBRID‑BC1® alloy is a CRA product with potential applications in the chemical processing industry that has demonstrated resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid. 
 In the oil and gas industry, HASTELLOY® C‑22HS® alloy has already found increasing applications. Commercialization of this alloy continues as is the testing, evaluation and promotion of this alloy with special emphasis on applications for this industry.
 In addition to the successful commercialization of the above alloys, the Company continues to develop applications for new alloys being scaled up at the mill and not yet ready to begin the commercialization process. HAYNES® HR‑235® alloy has excellent resistance to metal dusting in carbonaceous high temperature environments. Potential uses include applications in petrochemical production and syngas plants. HAYNES® HR-224® alloy is a HTA product with superior resistance to oxidation and excellent fabricability, and could be used in certain current and emerging technology applications. Another new alloy, HAYNES® NS-163® alloy, is a nitride dispersion strengthened alloy for certain potential high temperature applications. Most recently, HAYNES® 233TM alloy was introduced. This alloy offers excellent oxidation resistance at temperatures to 2100°F or higher coupled with superior creep strength, a combination of properties believed not to have been achieved previously in a readily fabricated alloy. This alloy is also being introduced to key customers. 
 Patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the Company’s business. The Company’s strategy is to file patent applications in the U.S. and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the Company. In addition, the Company seeks to protect technology that is important to the development of the Company’s business. The Company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new applications and alloys. The Company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers. Trademarks on the names of many of the Company’s alloys have also been applied for or granted in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.
 While the Company believes its patents are important to its competitive position, significant barriers to entry exist beyond the expiration of any patent period. These barriers to entry include the unique equipment required to produce these materials and the exacting processes required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties. These processing requirements include optimal melting and thermo-mechanical processing parameters for each alloy. Management believes that the current alloy development programs and these barriers to entry reduce the impact of patent expirations on the Company.
 End Markets
 The global specialty alloy market consists of stainless steels, general purpose nickel alloys and high‑performance nickel‑ and cobalt‑based alloys. Of this total market, the Company primarily competes in the high‑performance nickel‑ and cobalt‑based alloy sector, which demands diverse specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing. Given the technologically advanced nature of the products, strict requirements of the end users and higher‑growth end markets, the Company believes the high‑performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential, the opportunity for higher profit margins and greater opportunities for service, product and price differentiation as compared to the stainless steels and general-purpose nickel alloys markets. While stainless steel and general-purpose nickel alloys are generally sold in bulk through third‑party distributors, the Company’s products are sold in smaller‑sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct‑to‑customer basis.
 Aerospace. The Company has manufactured HTA products for the aerospace market since the late 1930s and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market. Customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specification requirements, precise tolerances and achieving new product performance standards. Stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight, reduce emissions, and develop more fuel-efficient designs require close coordination between the Company, the aero-engine OEM’s, and its customers in the selection and development of HTA products. As a result, sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the Company’s direct sales force. Demand for the Company’s products in the aerospace market is based on the new and 

 
  8
 
replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft. The Company’s HTA products are used for static components in the hot sections of the aero-engine. The hot sections are subjected to substantial wear and tear and require periodic maintenance, repair and overhaul. The Company views the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business as an area of continuing long‑term growth.
 Chemical Processing. The chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse CRA and HTA applications driven by demand for key end-use markets such as automobiles, housing, health care, biopharmaceuticals, agriculture and metals production. Both CRA and HTA supplied by the Company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early 1930s. Demand for the Company’s products in this market is driven by the level of MRO and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities, as well as the construction of new facilities. The expansion of manufacturing of natural gas liquids in North America is expected to be a driver of demand in this market. In addition, the Company believes the extensive worldwide network of Company‑owned service and sales centers, as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the Company’s direct sales efforts outside of the U.S., provide a competitive advantage in marketing its CRA and HTA products in the chemical processing market.
 Industrial gas turbine. Demand for the Company’s products in the industrial gas turbine market is driven primarily by utility-scale electricity generation, both for base load as well as for backup generation during times of peak power demand.  The benefit of these turbines are their relatively low cost, high efficiency, rapid response and reliability, especially as weather-controlled renewables have become major sources of electricity. An additional demand consideration is the drive to lower emissions from coal-fired generating facilities, since natural gas has gained acceptance as a cleaner, low cost alternative to coal.  Industrial gas turbines are also used for power and propulsion in certain classes of ships and ferries, most commonly as derivatives of popular aero turbine engines. Demand is also generated by mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation and for back-up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls. The company also has a strong presence in microturbine applications, which provide decentralized power and thermal heating for many key markets.  The Company’s products have allowed turbines to operate with higher temperatures and efficiencies for much longer service intervals.
 Other Markets. Other markets in which the Company sells its HTA products and CRA products include flue‑gas desulfurization (FGD), oil and gas, waste incineration, industrial heat treating, automotive, sensors and instrumentation, biopharmaceuticals, solar and nuclear fuel. The FGD market has been driven by both legislated and self-imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities. This market is expected to soften in the U.S. if the trend to switch from coal to natural gas for power plants continues, but has continued potential in other regions of the world. The Company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market, primarily in connection with sour gas production. In addition, incineration of municipal, biological, industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high performance alloys. The Company continues to look for opportunities to introduce and expand the use of its alloys in emerging technologies such as solar, fuel cells, ultra-supercritical steam and supercritical-CO2 power plants, and nuclear fuel applications. Markets capable of providing growth are being driven by increasing performance, reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets, which could provide further applications for the Company’s products.
 Sales and Marketing and Distribution
 The Company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization, which operates from 15 total locations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, 12 of which are service and/or sales centers. All of the Company’s service and/or sales centers are operated either directly by the Company or through its directly or indirectly wholly‑owned subsidiaries. Approximately 75% of the Company’s net revenue in fiscal 2019 was generated by the Company’s direct sales organization. The remaining 25% of the Company’s fiscal 2019 net revenues was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the Company’s direct sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  Going forward, the Company expects its direct sales force to generate approximately 75% of its total net revenues.
 Providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the Company’s marketing strategy. The Company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers. These analyses enable the Company to evaluate the performance of its products enabling the products to be included as part of the technical 

 
  9
 
specifications used in the production of customers’ products. The Company’s market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities. Management believes the Company’s combination of direct sales, technical marketing, engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high‑performance alloy industry. This framework allows the Company to obtain direct insight into customers’ alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers’ problems.
 The Company continues to focus on growing its business in foreign markets, operating from service and sales centers in Asia and Europe.
 While the Company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales, the majority of its revenue continues to be provided by sales to U.S. customers. The Company’s domestic expansion effort includes, but is not limited to, the continued expansion of ancillary product forms, the continued development of new high‑performance alloys, the addition of equipment in U.S. service and sales centers to improve the Company’s ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort, through the technical expertise of the Company, to find solutions to customer challenges.
 The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the Company’s fiscal 2019 net revenues generated through each of the Company’s distribution channels.

 | From | | From | | | 
 | Domestic | | Foreign | | | 
 | Locations | | Locations | | Total | 
Company mill direct/service and sales centers | 50 | % | 25 | % | 75 | %
Independent distributors/sales agents | 25 | % | — | % | 25 | %
Total | 75 | % | 25 | % | 100 | %

      The Company’s top twenty customers accounted for approximately 38%, 36% and 44% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. No customer or group of affiliated customers of the Company accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2017, 2018 or 2019.
 Manufacturing Process
 High‑performance alloys require a lengthier, more complex production process and are more difficult to manufacture than lower‑performance alloys, such as stainless steel. The alloying elements in high‑performance alloys must be highly refined during melting, and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce precise chemical properties. The resulting alloyed material is more difficult to process because, by design, it is more resistant to deformation. Consequently, high‑performance alloys require that a greater force be applied when hot or cold working and are less susceptible to reduction or thinning when rolling or forging. This results in more cycles of rolling, annealing and pickling compared to a lower‑performance alloy to achieve proper dimensions. Certain alloys may undergo forty or more distinct stages of melting, remelting, annealing, hot reduction, cold reduction, pickling and testing before they achieve the specifications required by a customer. This longer production cycle contributes to slower inventory turns. The Company manufactures its high‑performance alloys in various forms, including sheet, coil, plate, billet/ingot, tubular, wire and other forms. The Company also performs value‑added cutting services to supply certain customers with product cut to their specification.
 At the Kokomo, Indiana facility, the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined, melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high‑performance alloy. The Company’s primary melt facility utilizes two different melting processes. The argon oxygen decarburization process utilizes gas controls to remove carbon and other undesirable elements, thereby allowing more tightly‑controlled chemistries, which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high‑performance alloys. The other primary melt method utilizes vacuum induction melting, which involves the melting of raw materials through electromagnetic induction while under vacuum conditions to produce the desired tightly‑controlled chemistry. The control systems allow for statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality. For most high‑performance alloys, this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting. The resulting ingots are then 

 
  10
 
forged or rolled to an intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form. Intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling, annealing, pickling, leveling and shearing operations before being cut to final size.
 The Company has a four‑high Steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling high‑performance alloys, created specifically for that purpose. The four‑high Steckel rolling mill was installed in 1982 and is one of the most powerful four‑high Steckel rolling mills in the world. The mill is capable of generating approximately 12.0 million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to 72 inches wide. The mill includes integrated computer controls (with automatic gap control and programmed rolling schedules), two coiling Steckel furnaces and seven heating furnaces. Computer‑controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the Company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers.
 The Company also operates a three‑high hot rolling mill and a two‑high hot rolling mill, each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four‑high Steckel rolling mill. These mills provide the Company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements. The Company believes the flexibility provided by the three‑high and two‑high mills provides the Company with an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders.
 The coil and sheet operation includes the ability to cold roll to tight tolerances, bright anneal, oxidize anneal and pickle, along with finishing processes that slit and cut to size. The Company recently made the capital investment to redesign, rebuild, and operate a cold mill that had been shuttered for a decade, resulting in a significant increase in capacity in that area.  The Company has also invested, installed, and begun to operate a new processing line for more annealing capacity to support the added rolling capacity.  This added annealing capacity gives the Company the ability to offer either bright annealed finish or anneal and pickled finish that will be determined by specifications, application or type of alloy.
 The Company also produces bar and billet product through a series of bar mills and a forge press operation that is located at the Kokomo, Indiana facility.  
 The Arcadia, Louisiana facility uses feedstock produced at the Kokomo facility to fabricate welded and seamless alloy pipe and tubing and purchases extruded tube hollows to produce seamless titanium tubing. The manufacturing processes at Arcadia require cold pilger mills, weld mills, draw benches, annealing furnaces and pickling facilities. The Company recently completed a capital investment project that added capacity in the above‑mentioned processes.
 The Mountain Home, North Carolina facility primarily manufactures finished high‑performance alloy wire. Finished wire products and powder are also warehoused at this facility.
 Backlog
 The Company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices. There are orders in the backlog at any given time which include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs, that can vary from approximately 30%-50% of the orders.  Historically, approximately 75% of the Company’s backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately 90% have shipped within 12 months. The backlog figures do not typically reflect that portion of the Company’s business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or “just‑in‑time” basis. For additional discussion of backlog, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

      Raw Materials
 Raw materials represented an estimated 45% of cost of sales in fiscal 2019. Nickel, a major component of many of the Company’s products, accounted for approximately 30% of raw material costs, or approximately 14% of total cost of sales in fiscal 2019.  Other raw materials include cobalt, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. Melt materials consist of virgin raw material, purchased scrap and internally produced scrap.
 The average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the 30‑day period ended on September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, as reported by the London Metals Exchange, was $5.10, $5.68 and $8.02 respectively. Prices for certain other raw materials which are significant in the manufacture of the Company’s products, such as cobalt and chrome were lower in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, while the price of molybdenum was higher in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.
 To the extent that the Company is unable to adjust to rapid fluctuations in the price of nickel, cobalt and other raw materials that it uses in large quantities, there may be a negative effect on gross profit margins. The Company enters into several different types of sales contracts with customers, some of which allow it to pass on increases in nickel or other raw material prices to customers. In other cases, the Company fixes the nickel or other raw materials component of its prices for a period of time through the life of a long‑term contract. In yet other cases, the Company prices its products at the time of order, which allows it to establish prices with reference to known costs of raw material inventory, but which does not allow the Company to offset an unexpected rise in the price of raw materials. 
 The Company’s business model includes mill manufacturing and global distribution facilities, which create a long working capital cycle and contribute to a long position as it relates to commodity price risk, especially for product sold out of distribution facility inventory at spot prices.  In addition, the type of high-performance products the Company produces require multiple production steps to create the final yielded product that is sold to the customer.  These refining steps generate high revert scrap pounds that are recycled back through the melt at metal value.  This scrap cycle also contributes to a long position as it relates to commodity price risk.
 Although alternative sources of supply are available, the Company currently purchases nickel through an exclusive arrangement with a single supplier to ensure consistent quality and supply. The Company purchases raw materials through various arrangements including fixed‑term contracts and spot purchases, which involve a variety of pricing mechanisms. In cases where the Company prices its products at the time of order placement, the Company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials, thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials. However, to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly, there may be a favorable or unfavorable effect on the Company’s gross profit margins. The Company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers in connection with fixed price agreements with customers. In the event a customer fails to meet the expected volume levels or the consumption schedule deviates from the expected schedule, a rapid or prolonged decrease in the price of raw materials could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.
 The Company values inventory utilizing the first‑in, first‑out (“FIFO”) inventory costing methodology. Under the FIFO inventory costing method, the cost of materials included in cost of sales may be different from the current market price at the time of sale of finished product due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw material to the sale of the finished product. In a period of decreasing raw material costs, the FIFO inventory valuation method normally results in higher costs of sales as compared to last‑in, first out method. Conversely, in a period of rising raw material costs, the FIFO inventory valuation method normally results in lower costs of sales.

 Research and Technical Support
 The Company’s technology facilities are located at the Kokomo headquarters and consist of 19,000 square feet of offices and laboratories, as well as an additional 90,000 square feet of paved storage area. The Company has six fully equipped technology testing laboratories, including a mechanical and wear test lab, a metallographic lab, an electron microscopy lab, a corrosion lab, a high-temperature lab and a welding lab. These facilities also contain a reduced scale, fully equipped melt shop and process lab. As of September 30, 2019, the technology, engineering and technological testing staff consisted of 28 persons, 14 of whom have engineering or science degrees, including 8 with doctoral degrees, with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering or materials science.
 During fiscal 2019, research and development projects were focused on new alloy development, new product form development, supportive data generation and new alloy concept validation, relating to products for the aerospace, industrial gas turbine, chemical processing and oil and gas industries. In addition, significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, fuel cell systems, biotechnology (including toxic waste incineration and pharmaceutical manufacturing) and power generation.
 Competition
 The high‑performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten major producers participate in various product forms. The Company’s primary competitors in flat rolled products include Special Metals Corporation, a subsidiary of Precision Castparts Corp., Allegheny Technologies, Inc. and VDM Metals GmbH. The Company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high‑performance alloys (similar to those the Company produces) and other competing metals. The Company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed, such as plastics, ceramics or additive manufacturing that may be substituted for the Company’s products. The Company also believes that it will face increased competition from non‑U.S. entities in the next five to ten years, especially from competitors located in Eastern Europe and Asia. Recent tariff increases between the U.S. and China have adversely impacted the Company when competing with producers outside of the U.S. for sales into China.  Additionally, in recent years, the Company’s domestic business has been challenged by a strong U.S. dollar, which makes the goods of foreign competitors less expensive to import into the U.S and makes the Company’s products more expensive to export outside the U.S. 
 In recent years, the Company experienced strong price competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high‑performance alloys due primarily to weakness in the stainless steel market. Increased competition requires the Company to price its products competitively, which pressures the Company’s gross profit margin and net income.  The Company continues to respond to this competition by increasing emphasis on service centers, offering value‑added services, improving its cost structure and striving to improve delivery times and reliability.
 Employees
 As of September 30, 2019, the Company employed 1,179 full‑time employees worldwide. All eligible hourly employees at the Kokomo, Indiana and Arcadia, Louisiana plants (597 in the aggregate) are covered by two collective bargaining agreements.
 On July 1, 2018, the Company entered into a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America, which covers eligible hourly employees at the Kokomo, Indiana plant. This agreement will expire in June 2023.
 On December 21, 2015, the Company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America which covers eligible hourly employees at the Company’s Arcadia, Louisiana plant. This agreement will expire in December 2020.
 Management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory.

 Environmental Matters
 The Company has an enterprise level environmental policy, which focuses on fostering a safe workplace, offering high quality products while protecting the environment, compliance with law and health and safety management systems, utilization of all available resources to improve the quality, environmental, health and safety management systems and setting, implementing and reviewing quality, environmental, health and safety objectives and targets.  This policy is communicated to contractors and vendors who provide services on site, and the Company periodically audits selected suppliers from an environmental compliance perspective.  The Company maintains an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 standards and, for its Kokomo operations, ISO 50001 standards.  The Company maintains multiple policies designed to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and has OHSAS 18001 certification.  
 The Company’s facilities and operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage, handling, use, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. In the U.S., such laws include, without limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. As environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, it is likely the Company will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facility improvements. Expenses related to environmental compliance, which are primarily included in Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately $3.5 million for fiscal 2019 and are currently expected to be approximately $3.2 million for fiscal 2020.  
 The Company’s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities, who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws, regulations and permits. In the past five years, the Company has paid administrative fines, none of which have had a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, for alleged violations relating to environmental matters, requirements relating to its Title V Air Permit and alleged violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge. Capital expenditures of approximately $0.9 million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal 2019, with additional expenditures of approximately $1.6 million for similar improvements planned for fiscal 2020.
 The Company has received permits from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to close and provide post‑closure environmental monitoring and care for certain areas of its Kokomo and Mountain Home, North Carolina facilities, respectively.  
 The Company is required among other things to monitor groundwater and to continue post‑closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site. As a result, the Company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater, and additional testing and corrective action by the Company could be required.  The Company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites, if required. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 The Company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off‑site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances.  Generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, and state counterparts. CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators, site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties. The Company is currently named as a potentially responsible party at one site. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
