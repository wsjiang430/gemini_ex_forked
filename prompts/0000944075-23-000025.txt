Cordless Barcode Scanning. We offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets, and other computing devices over Bluetooth and SocketCam product, C820, a software-based barcode scanner. Our Software Developer Kit (CaptureSDK) enables application providers to integrate the features of our Data Capture software into their applications and helps differentiate our products. Our Cordless Barcode Scanners face competition from similar products from Koamtec, Code Corporation and Opticon (Japan). Barcodes may also be scanned using the built-in camera in smartphones or tablets with applications from Scandit or Manatee Works. Users may choose a barcode scanner that connects directly to an Apple tablet, iPhone or a computer such as offered by Infinite Peripherals and Honeywell. Users also may choose more rugged barcode scanners as an alternative, some of which are integrated into computing devices from manufacturers such as Datalogic, Honeywell®, and Zebra Technologies. Many of these devices are not Apple certified. Many connect to Apple devices over Bluetooth in keyboard emulation mode and do not offer extensive tools for application providers such as our software developer kit (CaptureSDK) to integrate features of our sophisticated data collection scanning software and hardware needed to meet the consumer’s requirement.
 
Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer. We developed and commenced sales in 2017 of a Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer, D600 that can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons and event tickets. In 2020, we launched a Contactless Membership Card Reader/Writer, S550 which enables us to expand our business into the emerging market for tap-and-go solutions that have traditionally been limited to payment solutions, such as Apple Pay, but can now be used for ticketing, access, and identification applications. The S550 was chosen as a finalist for the NFC Innovation Award in 2022. In 2022, we also launched S370, a universal NFC & QR Code Mobile Wallet Reader to enable our app partners to support eWallet-centric opportunities like mobile driver licenses and digital healthcare cards. We believe we are an early entrant into this market and do not face significant head-to-head competition from alternative reader/writer devices.
