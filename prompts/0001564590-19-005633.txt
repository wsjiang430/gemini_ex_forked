ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 Until recently, we were focused on developing our novel antifungal VL-2397, for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis. VL-2397 was being evaluated in a multicenter, open label randomized Phase 2 clinical study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of VL-2397 to standard treatment for invasive aspergillosis in acute leukemia patients and recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). In February 2019, we decided to discontinue the Phase 2 clinical trial of VL-2397 in order to conserve our cash resources while we pursue our strategic alternative review process.
 Our board of directors is conducting a review of strategic alternatives, including, but are not limited to, merger or acquisition transactions, issuing or transferring shares of our common stock, or the license, purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at maximizing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction or that our board of directors will determine that continuing our current business operations is in the best interests of our stockholders.
 Our Current Strategy
 In the third quarter of 2018, we announced plans to explore a range of strategic options to enhance stockholder value. We retained MTS Health Partners, L.P. to assist in the strategic review process.  Given our decision to discontinue the Phase 2 clinical trial of VL-2397, we will focus on concluding the strategic review process. 
 We expect to devote substantial time and resources to concluding the review of strategic alternatives. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions, we may not be successful in completing a transaction. Further, even if a strategic transaction is completed, it ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value.
 Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website at www.vical.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also make available copies of our news releases and other financial information about us on our website.
Product Development
 VL-2397 represents a potential new class of antifungal compound to address invasive aspergillus infections, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients. In preclinical studies to date, it has demonstrated faster fungicidal activity than marketed drugs and activity against azole-resistant fungal pathogens. Current treatment options have limited efficacy, as approximately 50-60% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis infections die within 12 weeks. Over the past 30 years, only one new class of antifungal drugs (echinocandins) has been introduced.
 The U.S. FDA has advised that VL-2397 would be eligible for a Limited Use Indication (LUI) approval assuming a successful outcome of a single Phase 2 trial carried out in accordance with a protocol and statistical analysis plan consistent with the Agency’s advice. The final determination whether the drug is approvable will be made by FDA after review of all relevant data. The LUI is a provision of the Limited Population Pathway established under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. In the case of VL-2397, the LUI approval would be for patients for whom alternative regimens are not available to treat their invasive aspergillosis.  A Phase 3 trial would be required to support full approval of VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in a broader population. The FDA has granted Vical Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP), Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for VL-2397 in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

About Invasive Aspergillosis
 Invasive aspergillosis is a life-threatening infection that typically affects immunocompromised patients, including those with acute leukemia and recipients of allogeneic HCT or lung transplants. Infection typically starts in the lungs and rapidly disseminates to other tissues. An estimated 200,000 cases of invasive aspergillosis are diagnosed annually worldwide.
Adjuvant Development
 DNA Vaccines with Vaxfectin®
 Vaxfectin® is our proprietary, cationic lipid formulation optimized to increase the immune response to vaccines. Vaxfectin® formulations have demonstrated safety and adjuvant activity in DNA vaccine applications in multiple animal models, including nonhuman primates. Studies of Vaxfectin®-formulated DNA vaccines against CMV and measles have shown enhanced immunogenicity in rodents and nonhuman primates. Vaxfectin®-formulated DNA vaccines have also been tested in approximately 400 healthy human subjects receiving influenza, dengue, or HSV-2 vaccines, and collectively, these Phase 1 trials indicate favorable safety profiles of these vaccines. We believe Vaxfectin® is an important potentiator of both antibody and T-cell mediated immune responses to DNA vaccines.
 Other Vaxfectin® Applications
 In 2013, we entered into a nonexclusive license with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, for our patented platform DNA immunization technology and our Vaxfectin® adjuvant for use in the production of antibodies. Under the agreement, BMS is using our technology to generate antibodies with potential therapeutic uses in humans. We also agreed to provide specified quantities of our Vaxfectin® adjuvant to BMS from time to time.
 Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
 We have entered into various arrangements with corporate, academic, and government collaborators, licensors, licensees, and others. In addition to the agreements summarized below, we conduct ongoing discussions with potential collaborators, licensors and licensees.
In-licensing
 Astellas. In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas, granting us exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize our novel antifungal candidate, VL-2397.  As consideration for the rights under the license, we issued 86,121 shares of our common stock to Astellas and made an up-front payment of $250,000 in cash. The license agreement provides for potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $99.0 million, as well as tiered single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of licensed products.  The royalty payments are subject to reduction on a country-by-country basis in certain circumstances where there is not exclusivity in the country. We are responsible for the worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products, at our cost, and we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities. 
 The license agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue until expiration of our royalty obligations with respect to licensed products. Either party may terminate the license agreement earlier if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period, or upon the other party’s insolvency.  Astellas may terminate the license agreement earlier if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees oppose or challenge any of the licensed patents. We may terminate the license agreement on a country-by-country basis for reasonable scientific, regulatory, commercial, financial, ethical or other reasons.
 As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate potential milestone payments that we could be obligated to pay under our active in-license agreements total approximately $99.0 million. These amounts assume that all remaining milestones associated with the milestone payments are met. We may also be obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of any products which incorporate the in-licensed technology. 
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We file patent applications to protect our technologies, inventions, and improvements to our inventions that we consider important to the development of our 
 4

business. We believe we have a comprehensive patent portfolio in the United States and in key foreign markets. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 We are the sole assignee of issued U.S. patents covering numerous examples of cationic lipid compounds that are used to facilitate delivery of plasmids to some tissues. Our Vaxfectin® adjuvant are protected in-part by lipid technology and/or lipid compound patents that extend up to March 24, 2020. Patent protection of these key lipids also has been obtained in Europe, Canada and Japan. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a U.S. patent term extension for up to 5 years may be available under certain conditions.
 We have been granted the exclusive right to Astellas patents which claim the composition of matter of, and methods of making or using, VL-2397. All of these issued U.S. patents and foreign counterparts will expire on March 13, 2029.    
 As of December 31, 2018, we were the assignee or co-assignee of 30 issued U.S. and foreign patents. We maintain our issued patents by paying maintenance fees to the patent office in each country when due. Where appropriate, we participate in legal proceedings to vigorously defend against the revocation or withdrawal of our patents. The scope and nature of these proceedings generally differ depending on the country in which they are initiated.
 See “Risk Factors—Our patents and proprietary rights may not provide us with any benefit and the patents of others may prevent us from commercializing our products,” and “The legal proceedings to obtain and defend patents, and litigation of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, could require us to spend money and could impair our operations.”
 Commercialization and Manufacturing
 We intend to develop and commercialize products both on our own and through collaborators. We intend to develop and commercialize products in well-defined specialty markets, including infectious diseases. Where appropriate, we intend to rely on strategic marketing and distribution alliances.
Competition
 We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in invasive fungal infection research and development. These include Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, F2G Ltd, Cidara Therapeutics and Scynexis, Inc. We may also experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire technologies from companies, universities and other research institutions. These companies may develop proprietary technologies which may materially and adversely affect our business. If these or any other companies develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our products, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed.
 Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive; however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to ours.
 5

Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales. 
 Government Regulation
 FDA Review and Approval
 Any products we develop will require regulatory clearances prior to conducting clinical trials and additional regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, biopharmaceutical testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices.
 Obtaining FDA approval is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, FDA approval requires that preclinical studies be conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on efficacy and to identify any major safety concerns. The results of these studies are submitted as a part of an IND which the FDA must review and allow before human clinical trials can start. The IND includes a detailed description of the proposed clinical investigations.
 A company must submit an IND for each proposed product and must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA approval. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk is presented to patients.
 To obtain FDA approval prior to marketing a biopharmaceutical product in the United States typically requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trials are the means by which experimental treatments are tested in humans, and are conducted following preclinical testing. Clinical trials may be conducted within the United States or in foreign countries. If clinical trials are conducted in foreign countries, the products under development as well as the trials are subject to regulations of the FDA and/or its regulatory counterparts in the other countries. Upon successful completion of clinical trials, approval to market the treatment for a particular patient population may be requested from the FDA in the United States and/or its counterparts in other countries.
 Clinical trials for therapeutic products are normally done in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients or healthy subjects to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In some special cases where the efficacy testing of a product may present a special challenge to testing in humans, such as in the case of a vaccine to protect healthy humans from a life-threatening disease that is not a naturally occurring threat, effectiveness testing may be required in animals.
 After completion of clinical trials of a new product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained. If the product is regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, is required. If the product is classified as a new drug, a New Drug Application, or NDA is required. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development activities, preclinical studies, and clinical trials in addition to detailed chemistry, manufacturing and control information.
 Applications submitted to the FDA are subject to an unpredictable and potentially prolonged approval process. Despite good-faith communication and collaboration between the applicant and the FDA during the development process, the FDA may ultimately decide, upon final review of the data, that the application does not satisfy its criteria for approval or requires additional product development or further preclinical or clinical studies. Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 6

Before marketing clearance for a product can be secured, the facility in which the product is manufactured must be inspected by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. In addition, after marketing clearance is secured, the manufacturing facility must be inspected periodically for cGMP compliance by FDA inspectors, and, if the facility is located in California, by inspectors from the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services.
 Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register, and report results for, all controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase 1 investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation. Trial registration may require public disclosure of confidential commercial development data resulting in the loss of competitive secrets, which could be commercially detrimental.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such product for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If a product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 We received QIDP, Orphan Drug, and Fast Track designation for VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. With Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation, if VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis is approved by FDA, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded. FDA’s Fast Track Drug Development Program is a process designed to facilitate the development and expeditious review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. These designations allow for companies to interact with the FDA review team frequently to discuss critical development issues such as study design, required safety data necessary to support approval, and structure and content of an application. Additionally, should the FDA determine that a Fast Track product may be effective after their preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by a sponsor, the FDA may also consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, known as a “rolling” submission.
 Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 We may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors. Such laws potentially applicable to our operations include:

• | The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti‑Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation.

knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off‑label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, require certain types of individuals and entities to protect the privacy, security, and electronic exchange of certain patient data.

• | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, administrative or civil penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity obligations, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Reimbursement and Health Reform
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.
 In the United States, third‑party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. 
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. 
 8

There are ongoing efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various reform measures. For example, in the United States, the Federal government passed comprehensive healthcare reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, in 2010.  With respect to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered by Medicaid and made changes to the coverage requirements under Medicare Part D, Medicare’s prescription drug benefits program.  Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the ACA, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the ACA. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.
In addition, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has recently come under increased scrutiny. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our current product candidates and those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.
 Further, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. If purchasers or users of our products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the cost of using our products, they may forego or reduce their use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and whether adequate third-party coverage will be available. 
 We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 30 full-time employees, including five with doctorate degrees and one medical doctor. Of these full-time employees, 19 were engaged in, or directly supporting, research and development and manufacturing activities, and 11 were in general and administrative positions. A significant number of our management and other employees have prior experience with pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology companies. None of our employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our management considers relations with our employees to be good.  In 
 9

February 2019, we made the decision to discontinue the Phase 2 clinical trial of our novel antifungal VL-2397. As a result, we plan to undertake a restructuring, including an appropriate reduction in staff.
