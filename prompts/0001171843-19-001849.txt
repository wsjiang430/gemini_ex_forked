DESCRIPTION OF THE WILHELMINA BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
The primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. These business operations are headquartered in New York City. The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the oldest, best known and largest fashion model management companies in the world. Since its founding, Wilhelmina has grown to include operations located in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and London, as well as a network of licensees in various local markets in the U.S. and internationally. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion model and talent management services, specializing in the representation and management of models, entertainers, artists, athletes and other talent, to various clients, including retailers, designers, advertising agencies, print and electronic media and catalog companies. The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1996.
Organization and Operating Divisions
 
The Company acquired the predecessor companies constituting its current primary business in 2008. The Company conducts its business through operating divisions and subsidiaries engaged in fashion model management and other complementary businesses. These business activities are focused on the following key areas:

· | Fashion model management
--+-------------------------


· | Hair & make-up artist representation
--+-------------------------------------


· | Celebrity management
--+---------------------


· | Licensing and branding associations
--+------------------------------------

Fashion Model Management
 
Wilhelmina is focused on providing fashion modeling talent and social media influencer services to clients such as advertising agencies, branded consumer goods companies, fashion designers, magazine publications, retailers, department stores, product catalogs and Internet sites.
 
The fashion model/talent/influencer management industry can be divided into many subcategories, including advertising campaigns as well as catalog/e-commerce, runway, showroom and editorial work. Advertising work involves modeling for advertisements featuring consumer products such as cosmetics, clothing and other items to be placed in magazines and newspapers, on billboards and with other types of media. Catalog and e-commerce work involves modeling of products to be sold through promotional catalogs and Internet commerce sites. Runway work involves modeling at fashion shows, which primarily take place in Paris, Milan, London and New York City. Showroom work involves on-site modeling of products at client showrooms and other events and production “fit” work whereby a model serves as the sizing model for apparel items. Editorial work involves modeling for the cover and editorial sections of magazines.

Clients pay for talent to appear in photo shoots for magazine features, print advertising, direct mail marketing, product catalogs and Internet sites, as well as to appear in runway shows to present new designer collections, fit modeling, and on-location presentations and events.  In addition, talent may also appear in film and television commercials. Wilhelmina develops and diversifies its talent portfolio through a combination of ongoing local, regional and international scouting and talent-search efforts to source new talent, as well as cooperating with other agencies that represent talent.
 
Within its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina has two primary sources of service revenue: (i) commissions paid by models as a percentage of their gross earnings; and (ii) service charges paid by clients in addition to booking fees, calculated as a percentage of the models’ booking fees.  Wilhelmina believes that its commission rates and service charges are comparable to those of its principal competitors.
 
Wilhelmina’s fashion model management operations are organized into divisions called “boards,” each of which specializes by the type of models it represents. Wilhelmina’s boards are generally described in the table below.
 

Board Name | Location | Target Market 
-----------+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Women | NYC, LA, Miami, Chicago, London | High-end female fashion models 
Men | NYC, LA, Miami, Chicago, London | High-end male fashion models 
Direct | NYC, LA, Miami, Chicago, London | Established/commercial male/female fashion models
Curve | NYC, LA, Miami, London | Full-figured female fashion models 
Showroom | NYC, Miami | Live modeling and designer fit clothing modeling 
Fitness | NYC, LA | Athletic models 

 
        Each major board is headed by a director who manages the agents assigned to the board. The agents of each board act both as bookers (including promoting models, negotiating fees and contracting work) and as talent scouts/managers (including providing models with career and development guidance and helping them better market themselves). Although agents individually develop professional relationships with models, models are represented by a board collectively and not by a specific agent. Wilhelmina’s organization into boards enables Wilhelmina to provide clients with services tailored to their particular needs, to allow models to benefit from agents’ specialized experience in their particular markets, and to limit Wilhelmina’s dependency on any specialty market or agent.
 
Most senior agents are employed pursuant to employment agreements that include noncompetition provisions such as a prohibition from working with Wilhelmina’s models and clients for a certain period of time after the end of the agent’s employment with Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina typically signs its models to three-year exclusive contracts, which it actively enforces.
 
The Aperture division operates in New York and Los Angeles, and offers models and actors representation for commercials, film, and television. 
 
Wilhelmina London Limited (“London”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelmina International, Inc., was acquired in January 2015. The London subsidiary establishes a footprint for the Company in Western Europe, provides a base of operations to service the Company’s European clients, and serves as a new talent development office for European models and artists.
 
The Company previously owned an unconsolidated 50% interest in Wilhelmina Kids & Creative Management LLC (“Kids”), a New York City-based modeling agency that specialized in representing child models/talents, from newborns to children 14 years of age. On December 9, 2016, the owners of Kids agreed to dissolve Kids and ceased related business operations of Kids. On March 1, 2017, the Company paid $0.1 million to another owner of Kids in accordance with the December 9, 2016 agreement to liquidate the enterprise. As a result, Wilhelmina no longer maintains a child models division.
 
Hair & Make-up Artist Representation
 
The Company represents artists in the hair, makeup, photography, and stylist arenas. These artists work on projects across the globe for well-known celebrities and companies in the media, advertising, retail, pharmaceutical and music industries. In addition, their work appears in top magazines and on the runways of major fashion houses. 
Celebrity Management
 
Wilhelmina’s celebrity division seeks to secure endorsement and spokesperson work for celebrities from the worlds of sports, music and entertainment. Celebrity has two primary sources of revenue: (i) commissions paid by talent as a percentage of their gross earnings; and (ii) royalties or a service charge paid by clients. Wilhelmina celebrity management works with emerging artists and established celebrity names to match them with leading fashion brands and companies.

Licensing & Branding Associations
 
Wilhelmina Licensing, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary that collects third-party licensing fees in connection with the licensing of the “Wilhelmina” name. Third-party licensees include several leading fashion model agencies in local markets in the U.S. and internationally. A consumer products license for fragrance and cosmetics is also in effect. The film and television business consists of occasional television syndication royalties and production series contracts. Also, from time to time, the Company conducts model search contests and other events in an effort to expand the Wilhelmina brand and recruit talent.
Content Creation, Production & Casting
 
The Wilhelmina Studio division offers services relating to content creation, production, casting, and influencer programming. With access to model and celebrity talent, photographers, directors, stylists, and makeup artists, Wilhelmina Studio serves as a one-stop shop for clients looking to establish fashion, beauty, and lifestyle relevancy.
Competition
 
The fashion model/talent management business is highly competitive. New York City, Los Angeles and Miami, as well as London, Paris, and Milan, are considered the most important markets for the fashion talent management industry.  Most of the leading international firms are headquartered in New York City. Wilhelmina’s principal competitors include other large fashion model management businesses in the U.S., including IMG Models, Elite Model Management, Ford Models, Inc., DNA Model Management, NEXT Model Management, The Lions Model Management, Women 360 Management, and New York Model Management. However, Wilhelmina is the only publicly-owned fashion talent management company in the world.
 
Competition also includes foreign agencies and smaller U.S. agencies in local markets that recruit local talent and cater to local market needs.  Several of the larger fashion talent firms operate offices in multiple cities and countries or have chosen to partner with local or foreign agencies.
 
The Company believes that its sources of revenue (mainly generated from commissions and service charges) are comparable to those of its principal competitors.  Therefore, for the Company to obtain a competitive advantage, it must develop and maintain a deep pool of talent and deliver high quality service to its clients.  The Company believes that through its scouting efforts, search contests, licensing network, advertising and television shows it is able to recruit a deeper pool of talent relative to its competitors. These recruitment tools, coupled with the broad range of fashion boards available to the Company’s talent, enable the Company to develop talent and generate a broader range of revenues relative to its principal competitors. While a broad range of talent and boards provides a level of stability to the business, certain talent may be more inclined to work with a boutique agency that may appear to tailor more specifically to their needs.
 
For more than 50 years, Wilhelmina and its predecessors have created long-standing client relationships and a number of business activities related to the fashion model management business that provide exposure to diverse markets and demographics. The Company has also developed a professional workforce with years of talent management experience.
 

Clients and Customers
 
        As of December 31, 2018, Wilhelmina represented a roster of approximately 2,200 active models and talent. Wilhelmina’s active models include Karolína Kurková, Francisco Lachowski, Audrey Marnay, Cyrielle Lalande, I-Hua Wu, Marlon Teixeira, Anne de Paula, Georgia Gibbs, Parker Gregory, Ninouk Akkerman, Anna de Rijk, Avie Acosta, Miss Fame, Hao Yun Xiang, Race Imboden, Wallette Watson, Marianna Dantec, Eli Cruz, Kailand Morris, Riley Harper, Lulu Bonfils, Luke Hemmings, Janis Ancens, Mikkel Jensen, Armando Cabral, Vanessa Cruz, Rayla Guimaraes Jacunda, RJ King, Ida Lundgren, Franisco Henriques, Dachuan Jin, Gracie Phillips, Mia Kang, Claudio Montiero, and Nathan Owens.

Wilhelmina serves approximately 3,600 external clients. Wilhelmina’s customer base is highly diversified, with no one customer accounting for more than 3% of overall gross revenues. The top 100 clients of Wilhelmina together accounted for approximately 46% of overall gross revenues during 2018.

Governmental Regulations
 
Certain jurisdictions in which Wilhelmina operates, such as California and Florida, require that companies maintain a Talent Agency License in order to engage in the “talent agency” business. The talent agency business is generally considered the business of procuring engagements or any employment or placement of a talent, where the talent performs in his or her artistic capacity.  Where required, the Wilhelmina subsidiaries operating in these jurisdictions maintain Talent Agency Licenses issued by those jurisdictions.  
Trends and Opportunities
 
The Company expects that the combination of Wilhelmina’s main operating base in New York City, the industry’s capital, with the depth and breadth of its talent pool, client roster and its diversification across various talent management segments, together with its geographical reach should make Wilhelmina’s operations more resilient to industry changes and economic swings than those of many of the smaller firms operating in the industry. Similarly, in the segments where Wilhelmina competes with other leading full service agencies, Wilhelmina believes it competed successfully in 2018.  
 
With total advertising expenditures on major media (television, Internet, outdoor, cinema, magazines, and newspapers) exceeding $200 billion in recent years, North America is the world’s largest advertising market.  For the fashion talent management industry, including Wilhelmina, advertising expenditures on television, Internet, magazines, and outdoor are of particular relevance.
 

Strategy
 
Management’s strategy is to increase value to shareholders through the following initiatives:
 

• | increase Wilhelmina’s brand awareness and consideration among advertisers and potential talent;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand the Wilhelmina network through strategic geographic market development;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand the women’s high end fashion board;

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | promote model search contests and events and partner on media projects (television, film, books, etc.).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Due to the ubiquity of the Internet as a standard business tool, the Company has increasingly sought to harness the opportunities of the Internet and other digital media to improve its communications with clients and to facilitate the effective exchange of fashion model and talent information. The Company continues to make significant investments in technology (including developing in-house art and social media departments) in pursuit of gains in efficiency and better communications with clients.  At the same time, the Internet presents challenges for the Company, including (i) the cannibalization of traditional print media businesses, and (ii) pricing pressures with respect to digital media photo shoots and client engagements.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 117 employees, 76 of whom were located in New York City, five of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s Miami office, three of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s Chicago office, 18 of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s Los Angeles office, 13 of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s London office and two of whom were located at the corporate headquarters in Dallas.
TRADEMARKS AND LICENSING
 
The “Wilhelmina” brand is essential to the success and competitive position of the Company. Wilhelmina’s trademark is vital to the licensing business because licensees pay for the right to use the trademark. The Company has invested significant resources in the “Wilhelmina” brands in order to obtain the public recognition that these brands currently enjoy. Wilhelmina relies upon domestic and international trademark laws, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect the “Wilhelmina” brand name used in its business. Trademarks registered in the U.S. have a duration of ten years and are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on appropriate application.
