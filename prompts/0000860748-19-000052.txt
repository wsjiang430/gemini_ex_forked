Property and Casualty Insurance Business
General
The Company’s property & casualty insurance business operations are conducted primarily through the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segments. In addition, the Life and Health Insurance segment’s career agents also sell contents coverage for personal property to its customers. Collectively, these segments provide preferred automobile, specialty automobile, homeowners, renters, fire, umbrella and other types of property and casualty insurance to individuals and commercial automobile insurance to businesses.
Property insurance indemnifies an insured with an interest in physical property for loss of, or damage to, such property. Casualty insurance primarily covers liability for damage to property of, or injury to, a person or entity other than the insured. In most cases, casualty insurance also obligates the insurance company to provide a defense for the insured in litigation arising out of events covered by the policy.
The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segments distribute their products primarily through independent agents and brokers who are paid commissions for their services. 
Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance
The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, based in Chicago, Illinois, conducts business in 45 states and the District of Columbia. As shown in the following table, five states provided 68% of the segment’s premium revenues in 2018. 
State | Percentage of Total Premiums
California | 22 | %
New York | 17 | %
Texas | 15 | %
North Carolina | 10 | %
Illinois | 4 | %

The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment primarily sells preferred automobile insurance, homeowners insurance and other personal insurance. The segment’s insurance products accounted for 22%, 31% and 33% of the Company’s consolidated insurance premiums in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The segment’s insurance products are marketed by approximately 4,800 independent insurance agents to individuals who have demonstrated favorable risk characteristics and loss history.
Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance 
The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, based in Chicago, Illinois, conducts business in 43 states. As shown in the following table, three states provided 92% of the segment’s premium revenues in 2018.
State | Percentage of Total Premiums
California | 73 | %
Texas | 10 | %
Florida | 9 | %

The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment provides personal and commercial automobile insurance to value-minded consumers who have had difficulty obtaining standard or preferred risk insurance, usually because of their driving records, claims experience or premium payment history. The segment’s insurance products accounted for 60%, 43% and 39% of the Company’s consolidated insurance premiums in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The segment’s insurance products are marketed through approximately 21,000 independent agents and brokers.

Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves
The Company’s reserves for losses and LAE for property and casualty insurance (“Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves”) are reported using the Company’s estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and LAE for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not yet been paid. 
Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves by business segment at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were:
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS | 2018 | | 2017
Business Segments: | | | 
Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance | $ | 452.9 | | | $ | 461.9 
Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance | 1,387.0 | | | 514.4 | 
Life & Health Insurance | 4.4 | | | 4.1 | 
Total Business Segments | 1,844.3 | | | 980.4 | 
Discontinued Operations | 27.4 | | | 33.1 | 
Unallocated Reserves | 3.2 | | | 3.3 | 
Total Property & Casualty Insurance Reserves | $ | 1,874.9 | | | $ | 1,016.8

In estimating the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves, the Company’s actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, the process of estimating and establishing the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of claims may vary materially from the estimated amounts reserved. The reserving process is particularly imprecise for claims involving asbestos, environmental matters, construction defect and other emerging and/or long-tailed exposures that may not be discovered or reported until years after the insurance policy period has ended. See MD&A, “Critical Accounting Estimates,” under the caption “Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” beginning on page 64 for a discussion of the Company’s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company’s actuaries in estimating the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves.
The Company’s goal is to ensure that its total reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and LAE are adequate to cover all costs, while minimizing variation from the time reserves for losses and LAE are initially estimated until losses and LAE are fully developed. Changes in the Company’s estimates of these losses and LAE, also referred to as “development,” will occur over time and may be material. Favorable development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company decreases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in an increase in net income in the period recognized, whereas adverse development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company increases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in a decrease in net income.
Development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE from prior accident years for each of the Company’s continuing business segments and discontinued operations in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was:
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS | Favorable (Adverse) Development
2018 | 2017 | | 2016
Continuing Operations: | | | | | 
Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance | $ | 8.3 | | | $ | (15.7 | ) | | $ | 23.4
Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance | (1.7 | ) | | (3.8 | ) | | (9.1 | )
Life & Health Insurance | (1.4 | ) | | (0.9 | ) | | 0.1 | 
Total Favorable (Adverse) Development from Continuing Operations, Net | 5.2 | | | (20.4 | ) | | 14.4 | 
Discontinued Operations | 2.2 | | | 1.5 | | | 6.3 | 
Total Favorable (Adverse) Development, Net | $ | 7.4 | | | $ | (18.9 | ) | | $ | 20.7

See MD&A, “Loss and LAE Reserve Development,” “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,” “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,” and “Life & Health Insurance,” for the impact of development on the results reported by the Company’s business segments. Also see MD&A, “Critical Accounting Estimates,” under the caption “Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” beginning on page 64 for additional information about the Company’s reserving practices.

indemnification, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) liabilities, including expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred losses and allocated LAE amounts as of December 31, 2018. See Note 6, “Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular reconciliation of the three most recent annual periods setting forth the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves as of the beginning of each year, incurred losses and LAE for insured events of the current year, changes in incurred losses and LAE for insured events of prior years, payments of losses and LAE for insured events of the current year, payments of losses and LAE for insured events of prior years and the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves at the end of the year and additional information regarding the nature of adjustments to incurred losses and LAE for insured events of prior years.
Catastrophe Losses
Catastrophes and natural disasters are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. These catastrophic events and natural disasters include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds and winter storms. Such events result in insured losses that are, and are expected to be, a material factor in the results of operations and financial position of Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies. Further, because the level of insured losses that could occur in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses contribute to material year-to-year fluctuations in the results of operations and financial position of these companies. Specific types of catastrophic events are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others. This factor adds an element of seasonality to property and casualty insurance claims. The occurrence and severity of catastrophic events cannot be accurately predicted in any year. However, some geographic locations are more susceptible to these events than others. The Company has endeavored to manage its direct insurance exposures in certain regions that are prone to naturally occurring catastrophic events through a combination of geographic diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of new business production in such regions, modifications of, and/or limitations to coverages and deductibles for certain perils in such regions and reinsurance. The Company has adopted the industry-wide catastrophe classifications of storms and other events promulgated by Insurance Services Office, Inc. (“ISO”) to track and report losses related to catastrophes. ISO classifies a disaster as a catastrophe when the event causes $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. ISO-classified catastrophes are assigned a unique serial number recognized throughout the insurance industry. The discussions throughout this 2018 Annual Report utilize ISO’s definition of catastrophes.
The process of estimating and establishing reserves for catastrophe losses is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim, net of reinsurance recoveries, may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. See Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” under the caption “Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition” for a discussion of catastrophe risk. See Note 20, “Catastrophe Reinsurance,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the factors that influence the process of estimating and establishing reserves for catastrophes.
Reinsurance
The Company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other natural disasters through a combination of geographical diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of new business production in such regions, modifications of, and/or limitations to coverages and deductibles for certain perils in such regions and reinsurance. To limit its exposures to catastrophic events, the Company maintains a catastrophe reinsurance program for the property and casualty insurance companies. Coverage for the catastrophe reinsurance program is provided in various layers through multiple excess of loss reinsurance contracts and an aggregate excess property catastrophe reinsurance contract. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries also purchase reinsurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the “FHCF”) for hurricane losses in Florida at retentions lower than those described below for the Company’s catastrophe reinsurance program.
The 2019 catastrophe reinsurance program covering the property and casualty insurance companies is provided by (i) three multi-year excess of loss reinsurance contracts, (ii) an annual excess of loss reinsurance contract (the “2019 Annual Excess of Loss Contract”) and (iii) an annual aggregate excess property catastrophe reinsurance contract (the “2019 Aggregate Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract”). 
Multi-year Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contracts
The first multi-year excess of loss reinsurance contract provides coverage over the three-year period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 (the “2017 Reinsurance Contract”). The 2017 Reinsurance Contract provides coverage in two layers, which together provide coverage for losses on individual catastrophes of $200 million in excess of $50 million. Under the 2017 Reinsurance Contract, the percentage of coverage is 31.66% for each year in the three-year period, and participation of each

reinsurer remains the same over the entire three-year period. Accordingly, the 2017 Reinsurance Contract provides coverage for 31.66% of losses on individual catastrophes of $200 million in excess of $50 million in 2019. 
The second multi-year excess of loss reinsurance contract provides coverage over the three-year period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 (the “2018 Reinsurance Contract”). The 2018 Reinsurance Contract provides coverage in two layers, which together provide coverage for losses on individual catastrophes of $200 million in excess of $50 million, which is consistent with the coverage provided under the 2017 Reinsurance Contract. Under the 2018 Reinsurance Contract, the percentage of coverage is 31.66% for each year in the three-year period, and participation of each reinsurer remains the same over the entire three-year period. Accordingly, the 2018 Reinsurance Contract provides coverage for 31.66% of losses on individual catastrophes of $200 million in excess of $50 million in 2019.
The third multi-year excess of loss reinsurance contract provides coverage over the three-year period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021 (the “2019 Reinsurance Contract”). The 2019 Reinsurance Contract provides coverage in two layers, which together provide coverage for losses on individual catastrophes of $200 million in excess of $50 million, which is consistent with the coverage provided under the 2017 Reinsurance Contract and 2018 Reinsurance Contract. Under the 2019 Reinsurance Contract, the percentage of coverage is 31.66% for each year in the three-year period, and participation of each reinsurer remains the same over the entire three-year period. Accordingly, the 2019 Reinsurance Contract provides coverage for 31.66% of losses on individual catastrophes of $200 million in excess of $50 million in 2019.
Annual Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contract
The 2019 Annual Excess of Loss Contract provides coverage for the annual period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. The 2019 Annual Excess of Loss Contract provides coverage for losses on individual catastrophes of $25 million in excess of $250 million, and represents additional coverage when comparing the 2019 and 2018 catastrophe reinsurance programs. 
Summary of Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contracts
Coverage on individual catastrophes provided under the three multi-year excess of loss reinsurance contracts for 2019 (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019) and the 2019 Annual Excess of Loss Contract is provided in various layers as summarized below.
 | Catastrophe Losses and LAE | | Combined Percentageof Coverage
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS | In Excess of | | Up to | 
Retained | $ | — | | | $ | 50.0 | | — | %
1st Layer of Coverage | 50.0 | | | 150.0 | | | 95.0
2nd Layer of Coverage | 150.0 | | | 250.0 | | | 95.0
3rd Layer of Coverage | 250.0 | | | 275.0 | | | 95.0

The estimated annual premium in 2019 for the three multi-year excess of loss reinsurance contracts and the 2019 Annual Excess of Loss Contract presented in the preceding table is $10.5 million. In the event that the Company’s incurred catastrophe losses and LAE covered by its catastrophe reinsurance program exceed the retention for a particular layer, the program allows for one reinstatement of such coverage. In such an instance, the Company is required to pay a reinstatement premium to the reinsurers to reinstate the full amount of the limit available under such layer. The reinstatement premium for the first layer of coverage is a percentage of the full original premium based on the ratio of the losses in excess of the Company’s retention to the reinsurers’ coverage limit. The reinstatement premium for the second layer of coverage is a percentage of half the original premium based on the ratio of the losses in excess of the Company’s retention to the reinsurers’ coverage limit. The reinstatement premium for the third layer of coverage is a percentage of half the original premium based on the ratio of the losses in excess of the Company’s retention to the reinsurers’ coverage limit.
Aggregate Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract
The 2019 Aggregate Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract is effective for the period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 and provides coverage for accumulated catastrophe losses of $50 million in excess of $60 million on property losses arising out of one or more of the following perils from storms or storm systems that are not named storms: (1) windstorm; (2) hail; (3) tornado and (4) fire; including ensuing collapse and water damage. 

 7

Coverage provided under the 2019 Aggregate Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019) is summarized below.
 | Aggregate Catastrophe Losses and LAE
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS | In Excess of | | Up to
Retained | $ | — | | | $ | 60.0
Coverage | 60.0 | | | 110.0 | 

The estimated annual premium for the 2019 Aggregate Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract is $11.5 million. 
The coverage presented in the preceding tables differs from the coverage provided in 2018. See Note 20, “Catastrophe Reinsurance,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to the 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program for the Company’s property and casualty insurance companies. To maintain the same level and percentage of coverage in subsequent years as provided by the catastrophe reinsurance program in 2019, the Company’s property and casualty insurance companies will need to purchase additional reinsurance in the future for the portion of coverage expiring at the end of 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
Other
In addition to the catastrophe loss exposures caused by natural events described above, Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies are exposed to losses from catastrophic events that are not the result of acts of nature, such as acts of terrorism, the nature, occurrence and severity of which in any period cannot be accurately predicted. The companies have reinsurance coverage to address certain exposures to potential future terrorist attacks. The reinsurance coverage for certified events, as designated by the federal government, is from the Terrorist Risk Insurance Act and the coverage for non-certified events is available in the catastrophe reinsurance program for the property and casualty insurance companies. However, certain perils, such as biological, chemical, nuclear pollution or contamination, are excluded from the reinsurance coverage for non-certified events.
In addition to the catastrophe reinsurance programs described above, Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies utilize other reinsurance arrangements to limit their maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposures on larger risks.
Under the various reinsurance arrangements, Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies are indemnified by reinsurers for certain losses incurred under insurance policies issued by the reinsurers. As indemnity reinsurance does not discharge an insurer from its direct obligations to policyholders on risks insured, Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies remain directly liable. However, provided that the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies is limited to the amount of risk that they retain. Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies purchase their reinsurance only from reinsurers rated “A-” or better by A. M. Best Co., Inc. (“A.M. Best”), at the time of purchase. A.M. Best is an organization that specializes in rating insurance and reinsurance companies.
For further discussion of the reinsurance programs, see Note 20, “Catastrophe Reinsurance,” and Note 21, “Other Reinsurance,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pricing
Pricing levels for property and casualty insurance products are influenced by many factors, including the frequency and severity of claims, state regulation and legislation, competition, general business and economic conditions, including market rates of interest, inflation, expense levels, and judicial decisions. In addition, many state regulators require consideration of investment income when approving or setting rates, which could reduce underwriting margins. See MD&A under the caption “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance” and “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance.”
Competition
Based on the most recent annual data published by A.M. Best, as of the end of 2017, there were 1,158 property and casualty insurance groups in the United States. Kemper’s property and casualty group, adjusted for the inclusion of Infinity, was among the top 7% of property and casualty insurance groups in the United States as measured by net written premiums, policyholders’ surplus and net admitted assets in 2017. Among all personal lines automobile insurance writers, Kemper’s property and casualty group was the 14th largest writer as measured by net written premiums in 2017.

Rankings by net admitted assets, net premiums written and capital and surplus were:
 | Ordinal | Percentile
Measurement | Rank | Rank 
Net Admitted Assets | 63 | 94 | %
Net Written Premiums | 30 | 97 | 
Capital and Surplus | 71 | 93 | 

In 2017, the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry’s estimated net premiums written were $562 billion, of which nearly 80% were accounted for by the top 50 groups of property and casualty insurance companies. Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies, adjusted to include Infinity, wrote 1% of the industry’s 2017 premium volume.
The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, particularly with respect to personal automobile insurance. Kemper’s property and casualty insurance companies compete on the basis of, among other measures, (i) using suitable pricing segmentation, (ii) maintaining underwriting discipline, (iii) settling claims timely and efficiently, (iv) offering products in selected markets or geographies, (v) utilizing technological innovations for the marketing and sale of insurance, (vi) controlling expenses, (vii) maintaining adequate ratings from A.M. Best and other ratings agencies and (viii) providing quality services to independent agents and policyholders. See Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The insurance industry is highly competitive, making it difficult to grow profitability and within expectations of investors.”
Life and Health Insurance Business
The Company’s Life & Health Insurance segment consists of Kemper’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, United Insurance Company of America (“United Insurance”), The Reliable Life Insurance Company (“Reliable”), Union National Life Insurance Company (“Union National Life”), Mutual Savings Life Insurance Company (“Mutual Savings Life”), United Casualty Insurance Company of America (“United Casualty”), Union National Fire Insurance Company (“Union National Fire”), Mutual Savings Fire Insurance Company (“Mutual Savings Fire”) and Reserve National Insurance Company (“Reserve National”). As discussed below, United Insurance, Reliable, Union National Life, Mutual Savings Life, United Casualty, Union National Fire and Mutual Savings Fire (the “Kemper Home Service Companies”) distribute their products through a network of employee, or “career” agents. Reserve National distributes its products through a network of independent agents and brokers. These career agents, independent agents and brokers are paid commissions for their services. Earned premiums from life insurance accounted for 11%, 16% and 17% of the Company’s consolidated insurance premiums earned in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
As shown in the following table, five states provided 48% of the premium revenues in this segment in 2018. 
State | Percentage of Total Premiums
Texas | 19 | %
Louisiana | 11 | 
Alabama | 7 | 
Mississippi | 6 | 
Florida | 5 | 

Kemper Home Service Companies
The Kemper Home Service Companies, based in St. Louis, Missouri, focus on providing individual life and supplemental accident and health insurance products to customers of modest incomes who desire basic protection for themselves and their families. Their leading product is ordinary life insurance, including permanent and term insurance. Face amounts of these policies are lower than those of policies typically sold to higher income customers by other companies in the life insurance industry. Approximately 73% of the Life & Health Insurance segment’s premium revenues are generated by the Kemper Home Service Companies.
The Kemper Home Service Companies employ nearly 2,200 career agents to distribute insurance products in 25 states and the District of Columbia. These career agents are full-time employees who call on customers in their homes to sell insurance products, provide services related to policies in force and collect premiums, typically monthly. Premiums average approximately $23 per policy per month with an average face value of $6,200. Permanent and term policies are offered 

 9

primarily on a non-participating, guaranteed-cost basis. These career agents also distribute and/or service certain property insurance products for the Kemper Home Service Companies.
Reserve National
Reserve National, based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The Company has traditionally specialized in the sale of individual Medicare Supplement insurance and limited health insurance coverages, such as fixed indemnity, specified disease, and accident-only plans, primarily to individuals in rural areas who often do not have access to a broad array of accident and health insurance products. The Company’s insurance products can be tailored to meet individual and family needs. Reserve National’s traditional distribution channel consists of approximately 500 independent agents.
Reserve National began expanding its distribution channels during 2013 by launching two marketing channel initiatives —Kemper Senior Solutions and Kemper Benefits. Kemper Senior Solutions markets life insurance and home health care products focusing on the individual, senior-age demographic of the market place. Kemper Benefits sells voluntary products in the employer market place. Brokers and non-exclusive independent agents are utilized to market and distribute products in these new distribution channels. Reserve National currently has approximately 4,300 independent agents appointed in connection with these initiatives.
Reinsurance
Consistent with insurance industry practice, the Company’s life and health insurance subsidiaries utilize reinsurance arrangements to limit their maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposures on larger risks. As the face amounts of the Company’s issued policies are relatively small, the ceded risks and corresponding premiums are also relatively small, particularly when compared to other companies in the industry. The segment is also exposed to losses from catastrophes arising from insurance policies distributed by career agents of the Kemper Home Service Companies. Over the last several years, the Kemper Home Service Companies have been intentionally reducing their exposure to catastrophic events through the run-off of their dwelling insurance business. Accordingly, except for reinsurance provided by the FHCF for catastrophe losses in Florida, the Kemper Home Service Companies do not carry any other catastrophe reinsurance coverage. 
Lapse Ratio
The lapse ratio is a measure of a life insurer’s loss of in-force policies. For a given year, this ratio is commonly computed as the total face amount of individual life insurance policies lapsed, surrendered, expired and decreased during such year, less policies increased and revived during such year, divided by the total face amount of policies at the beginning of the year plus the face amount of policies issued and reinsurance assumed in the prior year. The Life & Health Insurance segment’s lapse ratio for individual life insurance was 6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
The customer base served by the Kemper Home Service Companies and competing life insurance companies tends to have a higher incidence of lapse than other demographic segments of the population. Thus, to maintain or increase the level of its business, the Kemper Home Service Companies must write a high volume of new policies.
Pricing
Premiums for life and health insurance products are based on assumptions with respect to mortality, morbidity, investment yields, expenses, and lapses and are also affected by state laws and regulations, as well as competition. Pricing assumptions are based on the experience of Kemper’s life and health insurance subsidiaries, as well as the industry in general, depending on the factor being considered. The actual profit or loss produced by a product will vary from the anticipated profit if the actual experience differs from the assumptions used in pricing the product.
Premiums for policies sold by the Kemper Home Service Companies are set at levels designed to cover the relatively high cost of “in-home” servicing of such policies. As a result, Kemper Home Service Companies’ premiums have a higher expense load than the life insurance industry average.
Premiums for Medicare supplement and other accident and health policies must take into account the rising costs of medical care. The annual rate of medical cost inflation has historically been higher than the general rate of inflation, necessitating frequent rate increases, most of which are subject to approval by state regulators.

 10

Competition
Based on the most recent data published by A.M. Best, as of the end of 2017, there were 398 life and health insurance company groups in the United States. The Company’s Life & Health Insurance segment ranked in the top 25% of life and health insurance company groups, as measured by net admitted assets, net premiums written and capital and surplus. Rankings by net admitted assets, net premiums written and capital and surplus were:
 | Ordinal | Percentile
Measurement | Rank | Rank 
Net Admitted Assets | 90 | 77 | %
Net Written Premiums | 91 | 77 | 
Capital and Surplus | 96 | 75 | 

Kemper’s life and health insurance subsidiaries generally compete by using appropriate pricing, offering products to selected markets or geographies, controlling expenses, maintaining adequate ratings from A.M. Best and providing competitive services to agents and policyholders.
Investments
The quality, nature and amount of the various types of investments that can be made by insurance companies are regulated by state laws. Depending on the state, these laws permit investments in qualified assets, including, but not limited to, municipal, state and federal government obligations, corporate bonds, real estate, preferred and common stocks, investment partnerships, limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships. In addition, the quality, nature and amount of the various types of investments held by Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries affect the amount of asset risk calculated by regulators and rating agencies in determining required capital. See “Regulation” immediately following this subsection and Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The Company’s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income, the change in fair value of equity and convertible securities and cause realized and unrealized losses.”
The Company employs a total return investment strategy, with an emphasis on yield, while maintaining liquidity to meet both its short- and medium-term insurance obligations. See the discussions of the Company’s investments under the headings “Investment Results,” “Investment Quality and Concentrations,” “Investments in Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Critical Accounting Estimates,” in the MD&A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” in Item 7A and Note 4, “Investments,” Note 13, “Income from Investments,” and Note 22, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regulation
Overview of State Regulation
Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, primarily, but not exclusively, at the state level. Such regulation pertains to a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, policy forms, rate setting, licensing to transact business, market conduct, trade practices, underwriting standards, claims handling practices, transactions with affiliates, payment of dividends, nature and amount of investments, solvency, reserve adequacy, statutory accounting methods, risk management and corporate governance. In addition, insurance regulatory authorities perform periodic examinations of an insurer’s financial condition, market conduct activities and other affairs. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below.
Approval of Policy Rates and Forms
The majority of Kemper’s insurance operations are in states requiring prior approval by regulators before proposed policy or coverage forms and rates for property, casualty, or health insurance policies may be implemented and used. The Company’s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs can be adversely impacted by lengthy delays in the approval process or by the failure to receive the required approval of state regulators. 
Restrictions on Withdrawal, Cancellation and Nonrenewal
Many states have laws restricting an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. Laws that limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew a block of policies by line of business, or that subject their withdrawal to prior approval requirements, may restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets.

Financial Reports and Standards
Insurance companies are required to report their financial condition and results of operation in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulators in conjunction with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements and establish standards for the types and amounts of investments. In addition, state laws or regulations require minimum capital and surplus levels and incorporate risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards promulgated by the NAIC. These RBC standards are intended to assess the level of risk inherent in an insurance company’s business and consider items such as asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and other business risks relevant to its operations. In accordance with RBC formulas, a company’s RBC requirements are calculated and compared to its total adjusted capital to determine whether regulatory intervention is warranted. At December 31, 2018, the total adjusted capital of each of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum levels required under applicable RBC requirements.
Guaranty Funds and Risk Pools
Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are required to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies under the guaranty fund laws of most states in which they transact business. Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary pools or assigned risk pools, principally involving windstorms and high risk drivers. In most states, the involuntary pool participation of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries is determined in proportion to their voluntary writings of related lines of business in such states. 
Cybersecurity Regulation
Insurance regulators have been focusing increased attention on data security during financial exams, and laws and regulations have been enacted that impose significant requirements and standards for protecting personally identifiable information of insurance company policyholders. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services adopted a sweeping cybersecurity regulation that took effect in 2017 requiring a cybersecurity program which promotes the protection of customer information as well as the information technology systems of regulated entities, and similar regulations have been adopted in a number of other states. In addition, some states have enacted statutes based on a model data security law adopted by the NAIC that imposes additional requirements on insurance companies. The NAIC has also strengthened and enhanced the cybersecurity guidance included in its handbook for state insurance examiners. Additional state laws outside of the insurance industry impose notification requirements in the event of cybersecurity breaches affecting their residents. The Company anticipates a continuing focus on new regulatory and legislative proposals at the state and federal levels that further regulate practices regarding privacy and security of personal information.
Holding Company Regulation, Including Enterprise Risk Management and Governance
We are regulated as an insurance holding company system and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and, in some case, additional states in which the insurance subsidiary is deemed commercially domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’ insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, an enterprise risk report and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates within the insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, their parent holding companies and affiliates. 
Dividends
As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Kemper relies on dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to meet its obligations. Certain dividends and distributions by an insurance subsidiary are subject to prior approval by the insurance regulators of the state in which it is domiciled or commercially domiciled. See Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” under the caption, “The ability of Kemper to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock may be materially impacted by lack of timely and/or sufficient dividends received from its subsidiaries.”

Change in Control Requirements
State insurance laws also impose requirements that must be met prior to a change of control of an insurance company or insurance holding company based on the insurer’s state of domicile and, in some cases, additional states in which the insurance subsidiary is deemed commercially domiciled. These requirements may include the advance filing of specific information with the state insurance regulators, a public hearing on the matter, and the review and approval of the change of control by such regulators. The Company has insurance subsidiaries domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin. In these states, except Alabama, “control” generally is presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. Control is presumed to exist in Alabama with a 5% or more ownership interest in such securities. Any purchase of Kemper’s shares that would result in the purchaser owning Kemper’s voting securities in the foregoing percentages for the states indicated would be presumed to result in the acquisition of control of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries in those states. Therefore, acquisitions subject to the 10% threshold generally would require the prior approval of insurance regulators in each state in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled, including those in Alabama, while acquisitions subject to the 5% threshold generally would require the prior approval of only Alabama regulators. Similarly, consistent with the Model Holding Company Act, several of the states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have enacted legislation that requires either the divesting and/or acquiring company to notify regulators of, and in some cases to receive regulatory approval for, a change in control. 
Many state statutes also require pre-acquisition notification to state insurance regulators of a change of control of an insurance company licensed in the state if specific market concentration thresholds would be triggered by the acquisition. Such statutes authorize the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the insurance company if certain conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition. These regulatory requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions effecting control of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries, or the ownership of Kemper’s voting securities, including transactions that could be advantageous to Kemper’s shareholders.
Many states have made, or are in the process of making, modifications to their holding company laws. These modifications impose new reporting requirements and substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators to assess enterprise risks within the entire holding company system that may arise from both insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. They also impose new reporting requirements on affiliated transactions and divestiture of a controlling interest in an insurance subsidiary.
Federal Government Regulation
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Financial Reform Efforts
As part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). The FIO monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory system. The FIO submitted reports to Congress in 2013 and 2014 addressing how to improve and modernize the system of insurance regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act includes a number of financial reforms and regulations that may affect our business and financial reporting. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the future of the Dodd-Frank Act and how it may impact our business. 
Additional regulations or new requirements may emerge from activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, NAIC and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies. 
Affordable Care Act
In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as well as the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Acts”) became law, causing significant changes to the U.S. health care system. Since then, significant regulations have been enacted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury. The legislation and regulations are far-reaching and are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by mandating that most individuals obtain and certain employers offer to their employees health insurance coverage that meets prescribed minimum benefit requirements, as well as establishing minimum loss ratios, rating restrictions, mandates for coverage of defined essential health benefits, restrictions or prohibitions on pre-existing

condition exclusions and annual and lifetime policy limits. As a result of the complexity of the law, its impact on health care in the United States, the continuing modification and interpretation of the Health Care Acts made by statute, rule and/or executive order, and the on-going efforts to repeal or replace the ACA, we continue to analyze and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of the Health Care Acts on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA
The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions, including insurers, to protect the privacy of non-public information, to restrict use of such information and disclosure to non-affiliated third parties, and to provide notices to customers regarding use of their non-public personal information and an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended in 2009 by the HITECH Act, (“HIPAA”), and implementing regulations, impose extensive obligations regarding the privacy and security of protected health information. Covered entities subject to HIPAA, which include issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors, must implement policies and procedures governing the use, storage and disclosure of such information and related employee training, breach notification procedures and other requirements.
