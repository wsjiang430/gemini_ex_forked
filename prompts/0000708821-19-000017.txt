Item 1: | Business.

General.
PAR Technology Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries - ParTech, Inc. and PAR Government Systems Corporation - operates in two distinct reporting segments, Restaurant/Retail and Government.  Our Restaurant/Retail segment provides point-of-sale (“POS”) and management technology solutions; and, our Government segment provides intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (“ISR”) solutions and mission systems support.
In this Annual Report, the terms “PAR”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to PAR Technology Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
“PAR”, “Brink POS”, “SureCheck”, “Pixelpoint”, “PAR EverServ” and other trademarks of PAR’s appearing in this Annual Report belong to PAR. This Annual Report contains trade names and trademarks of other companies. Our use of such other companies’ trade names or trademarks is not intended to imply any endorsement or sponsorship by these companies of PAR or its products or services.
Restaurant/Retail Segment:  We are a leading provider of POS solutions to restaurants and retail outlets. We derived approximately 67% of our total consolidated revenues from our Restaurant/Retail segment in 2018, 19% of which we derived from customers of Brink POS, services and hardware. 
Products and Services.  Our products and services consist of POS technology solutions, including our cloud-based, software-as-a-service ("SaaS") Brink POS and on-premise POS PixelPoint solutions; our POS hardware platforms; and our installation, technical, and maintenance support services, all tailored for the needs of restaurants and retailers. 
Point-of-Sale Software. PAR continues to be a leading provider of POS solutions to restaurants and retail; primarily through Brink POS ("Brink"), we continue to expand our restaurant base and type of customers (tier 1, 2 and 3). Brink POS scales for use by single and multi-unit operators with traditional and/or mobile platforms. Brink POS is a leading solution for restaurants, particularly in the quick serve restaurant (QSR) /fast casual restaurant categories. A cloud-based platform, Brink POS eliminates the requirement for an in-store back-office server and simplifies software version control and organizational updates. Brink POS provides and integrates into mobile/online ordering, loyalty, kitchen video systems, guest surveys, enterprise reporting, and mobile dashboards. 
In addition to Brink POS, PixelPoint offers an on-premise integrated software solution, that includes a POS software application, a self-service ordering function, back-office management, and an enterprise level loyalty and gift card information sharing application.  The PixelPoint solution is primarily sold to QSR and independent table service restaurants through channel partners.
Our software applications and hardware platforms are designed to be complete and integrated solutions for multi-unit and individual restaurants, franchisees, and enterprise customers in the three major restaurant categories: fast casual, quick serve, and table service.  Each of these restaurant categories has distinct operating characteristics and service delivery requirements that are managed by Brink POS and PixelPoint. Both Brink POS and PixelPoint allow customers to configure their technology systems to meet their order entry, food preparation, inventory, and workforce management needs, while capturing real-time transaction data at each location and delivering valuable business intelligence throughout the enterprise.

POS Hardware. PAR EverServ POS platforms are designed to reliably operate in harsh environments associated with food service. PAR EverServ platforms are durable and highly functioning, scalable, and easily integrated - offering customers competitive performance at a cost-conscious price. PAR’s hardware platforms are compatible with popular third-party operating systems, support a distributed processing environment and are suitable for a broad range of use and functions within the markets served. 
PAR’s open architecture POS platforms are optimized to host our POS software applications, as well as many third-party POS applications, and are compatible with a variety of peripheral devices. We partner with numerous vendors that offer complementary in-store peripherals, such as cash drawers, card readers, and printers to kitchen video systems, allowing us to deliver a completely integrated solution through one vendor. 
PAR’s hardware platform offerings are primarily comprised of three POS product lines: EverServ 600 Series, built with the rugged durability PAR is known for and is a value platform for operators that require fewer features/functions. Its small ergonomic footprint is ideal for installations where space is at a premium. Its solid design is quiet, offers low power consumption, and minimizes maintenance; EverServ 8000 Series, designed and developed based on Intel processors, boasts a modern design and, while it is one of the smallest footprints available in the market, it is built to operate in harsh environments and endure high customer traffic and transaction activities; and EverServ tablets, designed to operate in harsh environments and features extended battery life.  Our EverServ mobility family of hardware platforms also include a variety of docking and charging stations, the ability to use magnetic credit and debit cards and payment systems, hand and shoulder straps and holsters to support the variety of product applications.
Services. We provide a complete portfolio of services to support our customers’ technology requirements during and after software and/or hardware deployments. We offer complete application training to our customers’ in-store staff and provide technical training to our customers’ information systems personnel. We provide installation, technical and break-fix support for our products through support services, license and/or subscription agreements with our customers. We also offer depot repair and overnight - Advanced Exchange - service. In North America, we offer 24-hour help desk support from our diagnostic service center located in Boulder, Colorado, and on- site support through our field tech service network, which services the continental United States. Outside of the continental U.S., we similarly support our products by providing call center, installation, on-site, and/or depot repair services to our customers depending upon a customer's geographic location. These services are delivered to our customers directly by us and by authorized third parties.
The restaurant market is fragmented and we support businesses of all sizes, from large corporations and their franchisees to single store operators. We believe our ability to offer comprehensive services including training, installation, maintenance, and technical support to a diverse set of customers differentiates us from our competitors.
Using a suite of software applications, our experienced service organization provides customers with knowledge based diagnostic solutions to resolve customer service issues. Our service providers compile information about potential customer or product trends and opportunities, and provide this information to our remote service technicians, to assist them in diagnosing - in real-time - issues occurring at customer locations, reducing the need for physical on-site service calls. Our customer relationship management system allows our call center personnel to maintain customer profiles, including customer hardware and software details, service history, and database of problem-resolutions, to maximize our service resolution effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
We work closely with our customers to identify and address the latest restaurant or retail technology requirements by creating interfaces to the latest innovations in operational equipment, including Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV), digital, and additional solutions located inside and outside of customer premises. PAR provides systems integration expertise to interface specialized components, including but not limited to video monitors, wireless networks, and video surveillance, to meet requirements of its global customers.
Food Safety/Task Management. Of the approximately 67% of total consolidated revenues contributed by our Restaurant/Retail segment in 2018, 3% was derived from the SureCheck solution. The SureCheck solution offers big box, food retail (grocery), C-store and contract food customers with a comprehensive digital food safety and automated task management solution to manage Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points, to implement Chef Critical Control Points compliance, and to augment facility maintenance. SureCheck provides retail operators a tool to effectively capture and monitor data to manage policy compliance and oversight, loss prevention, merchandising, and other audit functions. The SureCheck platform is comprised of three integrated technologies that are easy to use and quick to deploy: the SureCheck mobile application, a multi-mode wireless temperature-measuring device with optional remote temperatures sensors, and a cloud-based enterprise configuration and reporting server application. SureCheck competes for customers on the same basis as our POS product solutions.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
In the U.S., we market and sell our products through our dedicated sales teams, which directly interface with our tier 1 customers (owner and/or operator of 2,000 or more sites), tier 2 customers (owner and/or operator of 101-1,999 sites) and tier 3 customers (owner and/or operator of a 2 - 100 sites). Our international sales teams also market and sell our products and services to tier 1 customers outside of the U.S., as well as local/regional customers, from in-country offices. We also use channel partners to market and sell our products and services both in the U.S. and internationally.
Our products are also offered and sold through sales representatives, who enlist and support many well-regarded value-added resellers serving multi-unit operators, the independent restaurant category, and the non-foodservice markets such as retail, convenience, amusement parks, movie theaters, cruise lines, spas and other ticketing and entertainment venues.
PAR has developed and nurtured long-term relationships with several of the largest organizations in the Restaurant/Retail segment, including McDonald’s Corporation, Yum! Brands, Inc., and the SUBWAY franchisees of Doctor’s Associates Inc. Since 1980, PAR has been an approved provider to McDonald’s and its franchisees of restaurant technology systems and support services. PAR has been an approved supplier of Yum! Brands, which includes Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut, since 1983 and is a major supplier of in-store technology systems to concepts within the Yum! Brands portfolio. Other significant restaurant chains that use PAR POS products and related services include SUBWAY, Baskin-Robbins unit of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc., the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. units of CKE Restaurants, Inc., Five Guys, Jack-in-the-Box, and franchisees of these organizations. 
Competition
POS software and hardware offerings to the restaurant and retail markets is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Most of our significant customers have several approved suppliers of software and/or hardware similar to one or more of our products. We compete in these markets directly with product offerings from Oracle Corporation, NCR Corporation, and others. We compete on the basis of product delivery (cloud-based v. traditional on-premises software applications), existing and planned product design, features and functionality, software application and integration capabilities, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price, and customer service. Our competitive advantages include our integrated solutions offerings, including our cloud (SaaS delivery model) and on-premise software, ergonomic purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a customer dedicated direct sales force organization, and world class and responsive customer service and support. As relevant technologies evolve and customer demands and expectations increase, so do the competitive pressures in the market, with new companies entering and existing companies expanding their product and service portfolios. We expect competition in the restaurant POS market to continue to increase, including competition from both cloud-based and traditional on-premise POS software and hardware providers, payment processing companies expanding into the POS market, and other business software and solution providers. As to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess.
Research and Development
Continuous product research, innovation, and product development are an integral part of our business. We continuously evaluate customer needs, and new and relevant technologies, to enable us to develop innovative products together with enhancements to our existing products that improve and/or add to their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities; from leveraging the latest innovations in cloud computing to hand-held wireless devices to advances in internet performance. Research and development expenses were $12.4 million in 2018 and $12.0 million in 2017. We capitalize certain software costs in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic No. 985 and in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 350. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Identifiable intangible assets - of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report) for further discussion.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We assemble our ES 8000 series internally in the U.S., and we source other hardware products and related components from third parties. Although we purchase most of the materials, supplies, product sub-assemblies and full assemblies for our internal assembling from several suppliers, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our assembly components and hardware products. As a result, we periodically review and evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations in the event one or more supplier should fail to perform.
Government Segment:
PAR’s Government segment provides a range of solutions and services for the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and federal agencies. It is focused on two principal offerings - Solutions and Services and Mission Support.
4

Solutions and Services
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (“ISR”). We provide a variety of geospatial intelligence and situational awareness solutions for mobile and data center offerings. Our substantive, in depth expertise in these domains enables us to provide our government customers and large systems integrators with key technologies to support a variety of applications ranging from strategic enterprise systems to tactical in the field dismounted users. Additionally, we have developed a number of solutions relative to these advanced technologies and we provide integration and training support with respect to these solutions. ISR provides systems engineering support and software-based solutions to DoD research and development laboratories as well as operational commands. Our internal expertise ranges from theoretical and experimental studies to development and fielding of operational capabilities. Our employees are:
▪experienced developers and subject-matter experts in DoD Full Motion Video (“FMV”);
▪developers of geospatial and imagery data management, visualization, and exploitation solutions;
▪leading the development of technologies to train and test artificial intelligence systems;
▪developers of mobile computing applications for Android, iOS, and Windows;
▪architecting privacy, compliance and governance for sensitive customer data; and
▪developers of geospatial information system (“GIS”) solutions.
We are actively engaged in the development of mobility applications that support the needs of mobile teams with real-time situation awareness and distributed communications. ISR has a strong legacy in the advanced research, development and productization of geospatial information assurance (“GIA”) technology involving steganography, steg analysis, digital watermarking, and digital media forensics. These enabling technologies have been used to provide increased protection and security of geospatial data. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance also provides scientific and technical support to the U.S. Intelligence Community.
Systems Engineering & Evaluation. We integrate and test a broad range of government and industry research and development solutions. We design, integrate, and operate antenna data collection solutions for experimentation, demonstration, and test support. We also provide technical engineering and analysis services to intelligence community customers, supporting development and deployment of advanced prototypes and quick reaction systems.
Mission Systems
Satellite & Telecommunications Support. We provide a wide range of technical and support services to sustain mission critical components of the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN). These services include continuous 24/7/365 Satellite and Teleport facility operations and maintenance, engineering and installation services to include Inside and Outside Plant (ISP/OSP) services, and maintenance of infrastructure and information systems for low frequency (VLF), high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ground-based radio transmitter/receiver facilities including high tower antennas. We operate and maintain satellite communications and teleport facilities with extremely high frequency (EHF) and super high frequency (SHF) satellite communication earth terminals, and supports telecommunications architectures including fixed submarine broadcast systems and High-Frequency Global Communications Systems (HFGCS). The DoD communications earth stations operated by PAR are the primary communications systems utilized by the national command authority and military services to exercise command and control of the nation’s air, land and naval forces and provide support to allied coalition forces.
Space & Satellite Control Support. We specialize in supporting globally deployed operational forces by providing reliable 24/7/365 satellite control services for FLTSAT, UHF Follow-On, Polar EHF, and MUOS satellite constellations. In addition to satellite control center operations, we provide telemetry, tracking, and control mission planning for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) operations, satellite ground systems sustainment, maintenance and upgrades, Communications Security (COMSEC) management, anomaly response, notification, resolution and process improvement, and emergency response and disaster recovery services. Our experience also includes launch and early orbit (L&EO) rehearsals and support and on-orbit operations training.
Information Systems Support. We provide comprehensive, dependable, and secure information systems support services to the DoD and federal agencies. These services include ITIL-based, Tier 0 to 3 service desk operations for thousands of enterprise users, network system administration, database administration, information assurance/system security, information security training, and SIPRNet and NIPRNet management. We also perform maintenance, auditing, monitoring, upgrades, planning, testing, integration and configuration services, to include for security systems including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
The Mission Systems group supports critical information systems which operate elements of the DoDIN to support the National Command Authority (President & Joint Chiefs of Staff), DoD and other government agencies. Our system troubleshooting and regulatory experts support the customer mission around the globe. More than 50% of our footprint is outside the continental U.S. with contracts in Europe, Africa, Australia, and U.S. commonwealths and territories in the Pacific and Caribbean.

PAR has strong and enduring relationships with a diverse set of customers throughout the U.S. DoD and federal government. Our track record of delivering mission critical services to its government customers spans decades, and includes contracts continuing 15 years or more. We work closely with our customers, with the high preponderance of our mission system employees co-located at customer sites. Our strong relationships and on-site presence with our customers enable PAR to develop substantive customer and technical domain knowledge, and translate mission understanding into exemplary program execution and continued demand for PAR’s services.
Marketing and Competition
We obtain contracts primarily through competitive proposals in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, PAR often obtains contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals. Although we believe we are well positioned in our business areas, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of our competitors are major corporations, or subsidiaries thereof, that are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources. We also compete with many smaller, economically disadvantaged companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential “set aside” treatment, that target segments of the government contract market. The principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities and service. Many of our department of defense customers are migrating to low-price/technically acceptable procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions.
Backlog
The value of existing Government contracts at December 31, 2018, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $138.6 million, of which $30.2 million was funded. The value of existing Government contracts at December 31, 2017, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $111.1 million, of which $38.2 million was funded. Funded amounts represent those amounts committed under contract by Government agencies and prime contractors. Of the December 31, 2018 Government contract backlog of $138.6 million, approximately $53.6 million is expected to be completed in calendar year 2019, as funding is committed.
Intellectual Property and Other Rights
Many of our products and other components are developed and designed internally based on our existing copyrighted work and/or patents issued or pending; our other products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties.  We establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary information through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patents pending as well as registered and common law trademarks that protect our brand associations and symbolize our goodwill, as well as copyrights that relate to internally developed software and, various distinctive characteristics of our products. We also rely on a combination of confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and consultants, and enter into confidentiality and licensing agreements with customers and parties with whom we have strategic relationships. We believe our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets have value, and we believe our use and reliance on the intellectual property laws of the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as our agreements and licenses protect and maintain our rights in our intellectual property and other proprietary information. However, despite our efforts, unauthorized third parties may attempt to use, copy, or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property and/or our other proprietary information; moreover, the rapidly changing technology in the Restaurant/Retail segment and the Government segment make our future success dependent on the development skills, innovative designs, and technological expertise of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,000 full-time employees, including approximately 51% in our Restaurant/Retail segment, 44% in our Government segment (27% of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements), and 5% who are corporate employees.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
