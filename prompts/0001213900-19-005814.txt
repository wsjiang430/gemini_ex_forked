Item 1. | Description of Business.
------------+-------------------------

General
 
China Bat Group, Inc., (formerly known as China Commercial Credit, Inc.) has become a used luxurious car leasing business operating in China, after it disposed its direct loans, loan guarantees and financial leasing services to small-to-medium sized businesses, farmers and individuals (the “Micro-lending Business”) in July 2018. Our mission is to fill the significant void in the market place by serving business professionals, luxury car enthusiasts and other customers with luxury car rental services, which has been under-served due to the growing demand from the country’s rapid expansion of the middle class. Our current operations consist of renting out our luxurious pre-owned automobiles from its stores in the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as in the Hebei province.
 
The Company operates a luxurious car business that is conducted under the brand name “Batcar” through the Company’s VIE entity, Beijing Tianxing Kunlun Technology Co. Ltd (“Beijing Tianxing”), from its headquarters in Beijing.
 
Our Current Business
 
During the six months ended December 31, 2018, the Company, through Beijing Tianxing, which was controlled by the Company via contractual arrangements, offers our customers the opportunity to rent luxurious pre-owned automobiles in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As of the date of this report, the Company provides over 16 brands and over 60 types of high-end cars for leasing, of which eight cars are owned by the Company. The remaining cars are owned by various peer companies and are offered by them to other peer companies in a car pool. As a member of the car pool, the Company is able to lease the cars of its peer companies at a discounted rate and thereby provide an increased variety of high-end cars to its customers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased seven used luxurious cars and disposed of one used luxurious car for operating lease services and generated operating lease income of US$488,062 from the leasing business.
 
By the end of December 31, 2018, the Company had six luxurious cars in stock and purchased two additional cars as of the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K. Management is undergoing negotiations with a number of Chinese financial institutions, including investment management companies, regarding capital raising. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise sufficient funds from these or other sources to achieve our business goal of increasing our stock of luxurious cars and expanding our operations into other cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Sanya, and Xiamen. As of the date of this report, the Company has completed the preparatory work necessary to begin official operations in Shanghai and Chengdu.
 
Disposition of the Micro-lending Business
 
Historically, our core business has been the Micro-lending business conducted through Wujiang Luxiang Rural Microcredit Co., Ltd. (“Wujiang Luxiang”), an entity we controlled via certain contractual arrangements and Pride Financial Leasing (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. (“PFL”), our wholly owned subsidiary. However, since 2016, the microcredit companies in Wujiang area went through the most difficult time since their inceptions in 2008. Twelve of fourteen microcredit companies in the Wujiang area went bankrupt while the remainder are struggling with high default rates due to the poor economic condition, especially the slow-down in the textile industry. The operations of Wujiang Luxiang were also affected. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a loss of $5,486,667 and a net loss of $10,699,740 compared to a revenue of $2,246,807 and net loss of $2,580,136 in 2016, a change of 344% and an increase of 315%, respectively. As a result of the deteriorating economic condition, we experienced a substantial increase in the amount of default loans in both our direct lending and guarantee business. The amount of underlying loans we guaranteed has been increased by 6.7% to $11.6 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $10.9 million as of December 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2018, eleven cases against the Company were finally adjudicated by the Court, in which the Company was jointly liable, together with the defaulted customers and other guarantees, to repayment the principal, interest and penalties of $6.91 million. Additionally, three cases against the Company have not been adjudicated by the Court, in which the Company is jointly liable, together with the defaulted customers and other guarantees, to repayment the principal, interest and penalties of $2.97 million. In addition, the Department of Finance of Wujiang region has been evaluating the collection and performance of Wujiang Luxiang and may initiate proceeding to revoke Wujiang Luxiang’s business license if the operation is not improved. The Company’s financial leasing business has been on hold since October 2015 after we signed two leasing contracts worth a total of total $4.88 million February 2015. We did not have further funds to deploy in the financial leasing business and plan to hold off expansion of the leasing business

On February 28, 2018, we received a letter (the “Notification Letter”) from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum of $35 million Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum MVLS. The Company was provided one hundred and eighty calendar days, or until August 27, 2018, to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement.
 
The Company believed it is very difficult, if possible at all, to make collections on the default loans and guarantee obligations paid on behalf of guarantees. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has a stockholder deficit (or so-called negative net asset) of approximately $4.5 million. Management believes, if we keep operating the micro-lending, loan guarantee and financial leasing business, we will not be able to achieve the necessary minimum stockholder equity requirement or the minimum of $35 million MVLS requirement as required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to regain compliance by August 27, 2018. As such, the Company sought to dispose the Micro-lending Business while focusing on the luxurious car leasing or engage in other more profitable businesses.
 
On June 19, 2018, the Company, HK Xu Ding Co, Limited, a private limited company duly organized under the laws of Hong Kong (the “Purchaser”) and CCCR International Investment Ltd., a business company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with limited liability (“CCC BVI”) entered into certain Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). CCC BVI is the sole shareholder of CCC International Investment Ltd. (“CCC HK”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Hong Kong S.A.R. of the PRC, which is the sole shareholder of WFOE and PFL. WFOE, via a series of contractual arrangements, controls Wujiang Luxiang.Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to purchase CCC BVI in exchange of cash purchase price of $500,000. The transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is hereby referred as Disposition.
 
The Disposition was approved by the board of directors of the Company. Benchmark Company, LLC rendered a fairness opinion in connection with the Disposition, indicating that the Consideration to be received by the Company in the transaction is fair to the Company’s shareholders from a financial point of view,
 
On July 10, 2018, the parties completed all the share transfer registration procedure as required by the laws of British Virgin Islands and all the other closing conditions have been satisfied, as a result, the Disposition contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is completed. Upon completion of the Disposition, Purchaser will become the sole shareholder of CCC BVI and as a result, assume all assets and obligations of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by CCC BVI and the Company’s sole business became the leasing of used luxurious car carried out by the Company’s VIE entity.

Our Business
 
Since the launch of our luxurious car business in May till December 31, 2018, we offer our customers the opportunity to rent luxurious pre-owned automobiles in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As of the date of this report, the Company provides over 16 brands and over 60 types of high-end cars for leasing, of which eight cars are owned by the Company. The remaining cars are owned by various peer companies and are offered by them to other peer companies in a car pool. As a member of the car pool, the Company is able to lease the cars of its peer companies at a discounted rate and thereby provide an increased variety of high-end cars to its customers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased seven used luxurious cars and disposed of one used luxurious car for operating lease services and generated operating lease income of US$488,062 from the leasing business.
Our Inventory and Vehicle Acquisition Process
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we have six used luxurious cars valued at approximately USD 1.63 million, including a white Ferrari 458, a white Land Rover (Range Rover Executive Edition), a blue Maserati Geberit dark, a blue McLaren 570GT, a red Ferrari 458 Spider, and a Mercedes-Benz G63. To determine the model of vehicles to be purchased, we collect data related to customers’ demands and preferences through sales and online promotions. Our professional procurement personnel then compare models of vehicles offered by different sellers. The decision to purchase a specific vehicle is based on a number of considerations including time of delivery, vehicle condition, vehicle safety feature, mileage, repair and maintenance history, accidents history, market scarcity, and etc. All the sellers of the six vehicles we own are individuals.

Pursuant to local Beijing laws, each entity in Beijing has its quotas to purchase and own vehicles, even for auto leasing businesses. Therefore, all the six vehicles are owned by Beijing Tianxing’s wholly-owned subsidiaries while managed by Beijing Tianxing. The purchase price of the vehicles we currently own ranges from 50% to 80% of that of the new vehicles.
 
By the end of December 31, 2018, the Company had six luxurious cars in stock and purchased two additional cars as of the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K. Management is undergoing negotiations with a number of Chinese financial institutions, including investment management companies, regarding capital raising. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise sufficient funds from these or other sources to achieve our business goal of increasing our stock of luxurious cars and expanding our operations into other cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Sanya, and Xiamen. As of the date of this report, the Company has completed the preparatory work necessary to begin official operations in Shanghai and Chengdu, and has already begun its car pooling service (defined below) with its peer companies in Shanghai.
 
Our Services
 
Renting Service
 
We rent our luxurious cars to both our individual and corporate customers from our stores in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. The rental price varies based on the rental term which ranges from one day to one month; the longer the rental term, the cheaper the price. The daily rental price is the highest, while the average weekly rental prices and average monthly rental prices are 10% to 20% and 20% to 30% cheaper, respectively, than that of the daily rental price.
 
Customers can confirm the time and place for vehicle delivery and rental term via SMS messages, phone calls or face-to-face communication with our sales personnel, as well as through our website and WeChat Applet. Our sales personnel will then deliver the vehicle to the customers as designated. The customer, before signing the car rental agreement, will inspect the vehicle in person and pay the rent along with the deposit with their credit card, Wechat Pay or Alipay. The customer is responsible for the gas, toll, and any other expenses related to the use of the vehicle during the rental term.

---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Car Pooling Service with Peer Companies
 
In addition to directly renting to customers, we also rent to other auto rental companies in a similar fashion but at a discounted rate. We and our peer companies have formed a vehicle pool consisting of all available pre-owned vehicles. In the scenario where a customer places a rental order with a company which does not currently have the requested vehicle in stock, another company in the vehicle pool possessing the requested vehicle will rent it to the company at a discounted price upon its request.
Risk Management
 
Credit Risks
 
We conduct comprehensive credit checks against customers who place orders. We work with credit rating platforms such as JD Wanxiang and TYi Online to evaluate the customers’ credit. We may reject the order for any reason, including unacceptable credit ratings. Once an order is accepted, we will require a deposit ranging from US$7,500 and US$15,000 based on the vehicle being ordered and the customers’ credit score. The deposit consists of a vehicle deposit and a traffic violation deposit.

Damage and Theft Risks
 
We have installed five GPS trackers on each of our vehicles to track the location of the vehicle, and the locations of the vehicles are monitored every hour. If it is discovered that the vehicle has been driven far away from its rental location, a warning will be issued to the driver by phone to demand the return of the vehicle to the city of its rental location. Once the rental period is over, the vehicle is to be returned to a designated location to our salesperson. In the event the vehicle is returned with no damage other than normal wear and tear, we will process the refund of the vehicle deposit on the next business day. The traffic deposit will be refunded after we receive traffic violation records associated with the vehicle from the local police (approximately a month after the return) showing no traffic violation.
 
If the following conditions occur, the corresponding fee will be deducted from the deposit. In the event that the amount of deposit to be deduced by the Company to the customer is lower than the payment to the damage or repair cost, the customer shall pay such deficiency to the Company. In the event that the amount of deposit to be paid by the Company is greater than the payment to the damage or repair cost, the Company shall refund such differences to the customer:
 

a) | If the vehicle is found to have any damage at the time of return, the vehicle deposit will be used for payment of repair cost; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | If the mileage exceeds certain a threshold, the customer will be required to pay extra fees; 
c) | If the vehicle has less than 4/5 gasoline filled, a certain percentage of the deposit will not be refunded; 
d) | If the customer violates traffic laws during the rental term, the corresponding penalty will be deducted from the deposit. 

Marketing 
 
Currently we market our services by our own sales personnel and online promotion. Our operation is branded as “Batcar.” We have launched a WeChat and Weibo public account to promote our services. We started to introduce our services via major search engines such as Zhida and Baidu. We also started to advertise on major search engines to acquire users. We are actively engaged in social media platforms such as Baidu Tieba, Tik Tok, Weibo, WeChat, and Zhihu. We plan to launch wider and deeper social media marketing in the near future. We also plan to advertise via offline channels.
 
In the future, we intend to acquire customers by working with more sizeable and established auto businesses.
 
Seasonality
 
Our car rental business is subject to seasonal variations in customer demand patterns, with the spring and summer vacation periods representing our peak seasons.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our current business strategy is to increase our stock and variety of luxurious cars and expanding our operations into other cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Sanya, and Xiamen. As of the date of this report, the Company has completed the preparatory work necessary to begin official operations in Shanghai and Chengdu. We are also actively seeking additional auto rental businesses to cooperate in adding to our growing vehicle pool so as to more efficiently and effectively serve our customers’ needs.
Competition
 
Although the barriers to entry in this industry are relatively high in terms of the capital investment required to purchase the luxurious vehicles, we operate in a competitive environment. Our competitors are located in the northern and eastern region of China, especially in Beijing and Shanghai.
 
7

 

Our management believes that the demand for our services are increasing. Our management considers, amongst others, the following to be our main competitors as we compete with them in at least one of the categories of the services sold by us:
 

Name | Place of Operations 
------------+------------------------
Benson Car | 6 Cities, 4 Provinces 
Vagons Club | 8 Cities, 6 Provinces 
Sanda Group | 19 Cities, 15 Provinces

 
We believe that growing our vehicle pool through our own acquisitions as well as through collaboration with more peer companies will consolidate our market position in the industry, while simultaneously decreasing the number of competitors by cooperating with them and pooling our resources for the common goal of expanding the high-end cars leasing market.
 
Competitors in our industry would also help increase the variety and quantity of high-end cars leasing industry, standardize and specialize customer service processes, to standardize and create a higher transparency in the pricing of the high-end car leasing industry, and to strengthen the risk control system of the entire industry.

However, local practices differ and some of these requirements are not strictly implemented or may be modified or suspended by the local administration authorities in practice. If we fail to maintain such licenses needed for operation, our business may be adversely affected.

Car rental related services
 
As the car rental industry is at an early stage of development in China, the legislation of the car rental industry continues to evolve. The MOT and the NPC, the predecessor of NDRC, promulgated the Interim Rules on Administration of Car Rental Industry in 1998, which was abolished in 2007. Since then, there have been no national laws and regulations in place to specifically regulate the car rental industry in China except the Notice on Promoting the Healthy Development of Car Rental Industry, or the 2011 MOT Notice, promulgated in April 2011 by MOT. The 2011 MOT Notice sets forth general guidelines for the car rental industry in China and requires local government authorities to (i) establish and improve local rules and regulations on car rental business, (ii) promptly formulate local development plans for the car rental industry, (iii) encourage large and well-managed car rental companies of good reputation to set up branches and establish national or regional networks without any restrictions due to local protectionism, (iv) enhance the administration of the car rental business, including requirements to obtain and carry a valid permit or license for each rental car, and prohibitions of car rental companies from engaging in road transportation businesses without appropriate approval, (v) encourage car rental companies to innovate and develop new types of car rental services, (vi) create a favorable environment for the development of the car rental industry, and (vii) enhance the administration and supervision of the car rental industry.
 
The Road Transportation Regulation promulgated by the State Council in 2004, and amended in 2012 and 2016, regulates road transportation businesses (including road passenger transportation business and road freight transportation business) and other business operations related to road transportation (including operations of transportation terminals (sites), vehicle maintenance and repair businesses and training of drivers). However, the Road Transport Regulation does not include any provisions relating to car rental businesses.
 
The Administrative Rules on Urban Taxis promulgated by the Ministry of Construction and the MPS, which became effective in 1998, regulates the planning, operations, administration and services related to urban taxis, which was abolished in March 2016. MOT promulgated the Parade Taxi Management Service Regulations in August 2016, which was implemented on November 1, 2016. According to such regulations, “Taxi” is an integral part of the city's comprehensive transportation system and supplement of urban public transportation and providing personalized transportation services to the public”. “Taxi provider” should choose a reasonable route according to the destination specified by the passenger and use metering equipment as required to protect passenger’s rights.
 
The regulatory distinctions between car rental businesses and road transportation businesses or taxi businesses are not clear. As a result, local government authorities in China have imposed different requirements on the operating entities and/or vehicles that are involved in car rental businesses in the respective province or city.
 
Car rental services not accompanied by driving services
 
Set forth below is a summary of local rules and regulatory requirements in China regarding the provision of car rental services, which generally do not contemplate the provision of car rental services concurrently with the provision of driving services.
 

● | Some provinces and cities do not have any specific local rules regulating car rental services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Some local authorities promulgated local rules specifically regulating the car rental businesses. For example, the relevant local authority of Beijing promulgated specific local rules for car rental operations in Beijing. Car rental service providers in Beijing are required to make filings with the local transportation authority before they may commence their car rental businesses and make subsequent filings with the authority for any changes in the number of vehicles for rental and other relevant operational conditions and car rental service providers are strictly prohibited from facilitating to illegal operators. 


● | Although the Road Transportation Regulation does not include any provisions relating to car rental businesses, the local road transportation rules of certain provinces and cities, such as Shandong, Sichuan and Hubei and Suzhou require car rental service providers to obtain road transportation licenses from local authorities or make filing with local authorities covering their car rental businesses. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In some provinces and cities, local rules regulating taxi businesses also partially cover car rental operations, which may impose different requirements on car rental service providers from taxi service providers. For example, according to Shanghai Municipal Administrative Rules on Taxis, car rental service providers in Shanghai are required to obtain car rental licenses, which are different from taxi operation licenses, from the local transportation authority before commencing car rental businesses. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Some local authorities promulgated local rules, such as those in Beijing, Guangdong Province, Hubei Province, Chongqing, Xi’an and Kunming to require that the owner of a rental vehicle must be the same person operating the rental services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, among those provinces and cities that have promulgated local rules to regulate car rental business, the actual practice of the local authorities may differ from their local rules.

Regulations on penalties for violation of traffic laws and regulations
 
According to Road Traffic Safety Law, penalties for violations of the law on road traffic safety include: disciplinary warning, fine, temporary suspension or revocation of motor vehicle driver’s license and detention. The traffic administration department of the public security authority may, on the basis of the technical traffic monitoring records, impose a penalty on the owner or manager of the motor vehicle involved in violation of law. If the driver can be identified, it may impose a penalty on the driver. On December 29, 2016, the city government of Shanghai also revised its local regulations on road traffic administration, which took effect on March 25, 2017, to enhance the road traffic management in the area of Shanghai including, among other things, imposing various penalties on activities of violations of traffic rules and it also clarified that it is prohibited that using other person’s driver’s license to deduct points, deducting points for other person and introducing the aforementioned behaviors. on November 1,2018, Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee adopted the “Beijing Municipality Implementation of the Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China” (2018 Amendment), which was implemented on September 28, 2018, to enhance the road traffic management in the area of Beijing including, among other things, imposing various penalties on activities of violations of traffic rules and forbid any drive without prior registration with relevant competent authorities.
 
Motor vehicles are subject to periodic inspection. According to Rules on Motor Vehicle Registration promulgated on May 27, 2008 and amended on September 12, 2012 by the MPS, before owners of motor vehicles apply for inspection on their motor vehicles, all the traffic violations related to their motor vehicles shall be settled.
 
Regulations on vehicle insurance
 
Pursuant to Road Traffic Safety Law, compulsory third-party liability insurance must be purchased for each vehicle. Pursuant to Regulations on Compulsory Traffic Accident Liability Insurance for Motor Vehicles promulgated on March 21, 2006, amended on December 17, 2012 and February 6, 2016 by the State Council, owners or managers of motor vehicles driving on roads within China shall apply for the compulsory traffic accident liability insurance for their motor vehicles.
 
Regulations on limitation of use and purchase of motor vehicles
 
Certain cities in China have issued local regulations or rules to control the number of motor vehicles. For example, Beijing imposes an annual quota on the issuance of new vehicle license plates. Potential motor vehicle purchasers need to meet specific criteria and enter into a monthly draw. Only candidates who have been allocated a plate in the draw can apply to have their motor vehicles registered with the local vehicle administration. Shanghai is implemented an auction system for the issuance of new vehicle license plates. Under this system, each applicant is required to submit a “blind” bid for a vehicle license plate. Only successful bidders can apply to have their motor vehicles registered with the local vehicle administration. There are similar policies that restrict the issuance of new vehicle license plates in Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou and Guiyang.
 
In addition, some cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shijiazhuang, Nanjing, Wuhan, Harbin, Jinan, Nanchang, Chengdu, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Changchun, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Linfen, Langfang, Baoding and Dalian also have promulgated regulations or rules to prohibit vehicles with certain license plate from driving on road. For instance, in Beijing vehicles with restricted tail number of license plates are not allowed to drive within five rings road (excluding the fifth ring road) during 7:00 am to 20:00 pm each workday, and the vehicles with non-Beijing license plates shall also be subject to such restrictions. In Shanghai vehicles bearing non-Shanghai license plates are not allowed on certain roads during specified rush hours on workdays.

Regulations on registration of branch companies
 
According to the PRC Company Law amended and took effect on October 26, 2018 and the Administration Regulations of Company Registration amended and took effect on February 26, 2016, a company may establish branch companies, which are entities without the status of a legal person and conduct business outside the domicile of the company. Branch companies must be registered at the competent government agency and obtain a business license. The amended Administration Regulations of Company Registration sets forth the detailed formalities on the registration of branch companies.
 
Our PRC subsidiaries have registered one branch in shanghai and obtained a business license for it as of February 20, 2019.
 
Regulations on employment contracts
 
The Labor Contract Law of the PRC was promulgated on June 29, 2007, as amended on December 28, 2012 and effective on July 1, 2013. On September 18, 2008, the PRC State Council issued the PRC Labor Contract Law Implementing Rules, which became effective as of the date of issuance. The Labor Contract Law and its Implementing Rules govern the establishment of employment relationships between employers and employees, and the conclusion, performance, termination of, and the amendment to employment contracts. To establish an employment relationship, a written employment contract must be signed. In the event that no written employment contract was signed at the time of establishment of an employment relationship, a written employment contract must be signed within one month after the date on which the employer starts to use the employee’s services. An employer may terminate the labor agreement of an employee under certain specified circumstances and in some cases, such termination can only be done after fulfillment of certain procedural requirements, such as 30 days’ prior notice or upon payment of one month’s salary in lieu of such notice. In certain cases, the terminated employee is entitled to receive a severance payment equal to the average monthly salary during the 12-month period immediately preceding to the termination (inclusive of all monetary income such as base salary, bonus, allowances, etc.), for each year of service up to the date of termination. If an employer terminate an labor contract in any circumstance other than those specified under the Labor Contract Law and its implementing rules, including termination without cause, the employer must either reinstate and continue to perform the employee’s employment contract or pay the employee damages calculated at twice the rate for calculating the severance payment, subject to the employee’s own request. In the case that the employee requests for damages, the employer is not required to pay other severance or the remainder of the amount owed under the employment contract unless the employment contract has otherwise provided for.
 
12

 

In addition, according to the Labor Contract Law and its implementing rules, in order to enforce the non-compete provision with the employees after the termination or ending of employment relationship, the employer shall compensate the employees on a monthly basis during the non-competition period after such termination or ending of employment.
 
On January 24, 2014 the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security promulgated Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatching, or Circular 22, effective from March 1, 2014, which provides that an employer shall strictly control the number of employees under labor dispatching arrangements and dispatched employees can only be used in temporary, ancillary and replaceable positions. The number of dispatched workers used by an employer shall be reduced to no more than 10% of the total number of its employees within two years after March 1, 2014. If the employer fails to reduce the number of dispatched employees as required by Circular 22 and could not correct its practice after receiving warnings from government authority, the employer may be subject to a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB5,000 per dispatched employee.


Regulation on PRC business tax and VAT
 
Prior to January 1, 2012, pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Business Tax and its Implementing Rules, an entity or individual rendering services in China was generally subject to a business tax at the rate of 5% on revenues generated from the provision of such services. Since January 1, 2012, the MOF and the SAT have started to implement the VAT Pilot Program, which imposes VAT in lieu of business tax for certain industries in Shanghai. Since August 1, 2012, the VAT Pilot Program has been expanded to and implemented in other regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Guangdong. On May 24, 2013, the MOF and the SAT jointly issued Notice 37, which expanded the VAT Pilot Program nationwide starting on August 1, 2013. On December 12, 2013, the MOF and the SAT jointly issued Notice 106, effective on January 1, 2014, which replaced Notice 37 and improved some tax policies in the VAT Pilot Program. From May 1, 2016, the VAT were expanded to all business tax taxpayers and until November 19, 2017, the State Council promulgated Decision of the State Council on Abolishing the Provisional Regulations on Business Tax of the People's Republic of China and Amending the Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax of the People's Republic of China. As a result of the VAT, an entity or individual rendering services in China is subject to VAT at the rate of 17%, 11% or 6%, as applicable. We are small-scale taxpayer and shall apply to a VAT rate of 3% unless otherwise specified by the State Council.
 
Regulations on PRC Enterprise Income Tax 
 
The PRC enterprise income tax is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the PRC laws and accounting standards. On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of China enacted a new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law on February 24, 2017. On December 6, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Rules to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the Implementation Rules, which also became effective on January 1, 2008. On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued the Notice on Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Transition Preferential Policy under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the Transition Preferential Policy Circular, which became effective simultaneously with the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law. On October 17, 2017, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises, which became effective on December 1, 2017. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all domestic enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises unless they qualify for certain exceptions, and terminates most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatments available under previous tax laws and regulations.
 
13

 

Moreover, under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, enterprises organized under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their “de facto management bodies” located within China may be considered PRC resident enterprises and therefore subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their worldwide income. The Implementation Rules define the term “de facto management body” as the management body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the Circular Related to Relevant Issues on the Identification of a Chinese holding Company Incorporated Overseas as a Residential Enterprise under the Criterion of De Facto Management Bodies Recognizing issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a “resident enterprise” with its “de facto management bodies” located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in China; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in China; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals and minutes and files of its board and shareholders’ meetings are located or kept in China; and (iv) more than half of the enterprise’s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in China. Although the circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, individuals or foreigners.
 
Torts law
 
The PRC Torts Law was promulgated by the NPC Standing Committee on December 26, 2009 and became effective on July 1, 2010. According to the Torts Law, in the case of car rental, where the driver is different from the owner of the vehicle, if the driver is held liable for a traffic accident, such liability will first be covered by the insurance company within the coverage of the compulsory traffic accident insurance of the vehicle. If the insurance coverage is not sufficient, the driver shall be responsible for the remaining compensation, and the vehicle owner shall not be liable for compensation unless the owner has fault in such accident.
 
Regulations on foreign currency exchange and dividend distribution 
 
Foreign currency exchange
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, which was most recently amended in August 2008. Under the PRC Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as distribution of dividends, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE. On the contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to convert into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital account items, such as direct investments, repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China.
 
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, or Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Policies, which substantially amends and simplifies the foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Policies, the opening of various foreign exchange accounts for designated purposes, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds derived by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by foreign-invested enterprises to their foreign shareholders, no longer require approval or verification from SAFE, and the same entity may open multiple capital accounts in different provinces.
 
On May 10, 2013, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration Over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over foreign direct investment in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration. Institutions and individuals shall register with SAFE and/or its branches for their direct investment in China. Banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in China based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
 
14

 

In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or Circular 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015. Upon the implementation of Circular 13, the current foreign exchange procedures will be further simplified, foreign exchange registrations of direct investment will be handled by designated foreign exchange settlement banks instead of SAFE and its branches.
 
On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular on Reform of the Administrative Rules of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (“SAFE Circular 19”), which became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested enterprises may either continue to follow the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or elect to follow the “conversion-at-will” regime of foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will regime of foreign currency settlement, it may convert part or all of the amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if the foreign-invested enterprise needs to make payment from such designated account, it still needs to go through the review process with its bank and provide necessary supporting documents. SAFE Circular 19, therefore, has substantially lifted the restrictions on the usage by a foreign-invested enterprise of its RMB registered capital converted from foreign currencies. According to SAFE Circular 19, such Renminbi capital may be used at the discretion of the foreign-invested enterprise and SAFE will eliminate the prior approval requirement and only examine the authenticity of the declared usage afterwards. Nevertheless, foreign-invested enterprises are still not allowed to extend intercompany loans to PRC consolidated entities. In addition, as Circular 19 was promulgated recently, there remain substantial uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of this circular by relevant authorities.
 
On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts (“Circular 16”), which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purpose beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC Laws or regulations, while such converted RMB shall not be provide as loans to its non-affiliated entities.
 
On January 26, 2017, SAFE issued the Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to further Promote Foreign Exchange Control, or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks must check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities must hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.
 
Regulations on dividend distribution
 
The principal regulations governing dividend distributions of wholly foreign-owned companies include:
 

● | Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law, as amended on September 3, 2016; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules, as amended on February 19, 2014; and 
● | Company Law of China, as amended on December 28, 2013. 

 
Under these laws and regulations, wholly foreign-owned companies in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, these wholly foreign-owned companies are required to set aside no less than 10% of the after-tax profits, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. At the discretion of these wholly foreign-owned companies, they may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.

Regulations on Employee Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company
 
In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participation in Share Incentive Plan of Companies Listed Overseas, or the 2012 SAFE Notice. Under such notice and other relevant rules and regulations, PRC residents, including PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, that participate in any share incentive plan of any overseas publicly-listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a share incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plan on behalf of the participants. We and our executive officers and other employees who are PRC residents that have been granted share incentive awards will be subject to these regulations upon the completion of this offering. Failure by these individuals to complete their SAFE registrations may subject such individuals and us to fines and other legal sanctions.
 
The SAT has issued certain circulars concerning employee share incentive awards. Under these circulars, our employees working in China who exercise share incentive awards will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has the obligation to make filings related to employee share incentive awards with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share incentive awards. If our employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities.
 
Regulations on Offshore Investment by PRC Residents
 
Pursuant to the SAFE’s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Round Trip Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Companies and its subsequent amendments, supplements or implementation rules, or SAFE Circular 75, issued on October 21, 2005, a PRC resident (whether a natural person or legal persons) shall register with the local branch of the SAFE before it establishes or controls an overseas SPV, with assets or equity interests in a PRC company, for the purpose of overseas equity financing. On July 4, 2014, SAFE issued the SAFE’s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Outbound Investment and Financing and Inbound Investment via Special Purpose Vehicles (“SPV”), or SAFE Circular 37, which has superseded SAFE Circular 75. According to SAFE Circular 37, the PRC domestic resident shall apply for SAFE registration for overseas investment before paying capital to SPV by using his, her or its legal assets whether overseas or domestic. The SPV is defined as “offshore enterprise directly established or indirectly controlled by the domestic residents (including domestic institutions and individuals) with their legally owned assets and equity of the domestic enterprise, or legally owned offshore assets or equity, for the purpose of off shore investment and financing”. In addition, in the event that the SPV undergoes changes of its basic information such as the individual shareholder, name, operation term, etc., or material events including increase or decrease by domestic individual shareholder in investment amount, equity transfer or swap, merge, spinoff, etc., the domestic resident shall timely complete the change of foreign exchange registration formality for offshore investment.
 
According to SAFE Circular 37, failure to make such registration or truthfully disclose actual controllers of the round-trip enterprises may subject PRC residents to fines up to RMB300,000 in case of domestic institutions or RMB50,000 in case of domestic individuals. If the registered or beneficial shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiary may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for violating applicable foreign exchange restrictions.

Regulations on cross-border direct investment in Renminbi
 
On October 12, 2011, MOFCOM issued the Notice of the Ministry of Commerce on Issues concerning Cross border Direct Investment in Renminbi which was abolished in 2013 and on December 3, 2013 the MOFCOM promulgated the Announcement on Issues relating to Cross-border Direct Investment in RMB, effective from January 1, 2014. Under this announcement, the “cross- border direct investment in RMB “shall refer to the direct investment activities conducted by foreign investors (including the investors from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in China with offshore RMB funds obtained legally, including, among other things, the establishment of new enterprises, increase of capital, shareholding or merger and acquisition of domestic enterprises. The cross-border direct investment in RMB by a foreign investor or reinvestment by its foreign-invested enterprise shall conform to the requirements of laws, regulations and relevant provisions on foreign investment and comply with the foreign investment industry policies of China and the provisions on security review of foreign investment mergers and acquisitions and anti-monopoly review. No foreign-invested enterprise is allowed to use the funds of cross-border direct investment in RMB for investment, directly or indirectly, in negotiable securities and financial derivatives in China (except for strategic investment in listed companies) or for entrusted loans. On October 13, 2011, the PBOC issued the Management Rules on the Settlement of Foreign Direct Invested Renminbi, which provide that foreign invested enterprises with RMB-dominated foreign direct investment must register with the PBOC or its local branch after obtaining the permit from MOFCOM and the business license.
