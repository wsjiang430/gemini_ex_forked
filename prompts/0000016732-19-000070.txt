Item 1. Business
The Company 
Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, we trace our heritage in the food business back to 1869. Our principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799. 
In 2015, we acquired the assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet. In 2018, we acquired Pacific Foods of Oregon, LLC and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance). See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions. 
In 2019, we announced our plan to divest our Campbell Fresh operating segment and our international biscuits and snacks operating segment. Within our Campbell Fresh operating segment, we:
•sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business on February 25, 2019;
•sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business on April 25, 2019; and
•sold our Bolthouse Farms business on June 16, 2019. 
Within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, we:

• | signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Kelsen business on July 12, 2019, and completed the sale on September 23, 2019;


• | signed a definitive agreement on August 1, 2019, for the sale of our Arnott’s business and certain other international operations, including the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages businesses in Australia and Asia Pacific (the Arnott’s and international operations); and


• | signed a definitive agreement on September 18, 2019, for the sale of our European chips business.

We expect to complete the sales of our pending divestitures in the first half of 2020 and use the net proceeds from the sales to reduce debt. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our recently completed and pending divestitures. To support our more focused portfolio, we are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million from continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our cost savings initiatives.
Our U.S. refrigerated soup business, our Garden Fresh Gourmet business and our Bolthouse Farms business were historically included in the Campbell Fresh segment. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reflected in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 29, 2018. A portion of the U.S refrigerated soup business historically included in Campbell Fresh was retained, and is now reported in Meals & Beverages. 
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of our Kelsen business and Arnott’s and international operations (collectively referred to as Campbell International) as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reflected in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 28, 2019, and July 29, 2018. 
Segment results in prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

Reportable Segments 
The segments are aggregated based on similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment. Our reportable segments are:

• | Meals & Beverages, which includes the retail and foodservice businesses in the U.S. and Canada. The segment includes the following products: Campbell’s condensed and ready-to-serve soups; Swanson broth and stocks; Pacific Foods broth, soups, non-dairy beverages and other simple meals; Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbell’s gravies, pasta, beans and dinner sauces; Swanson canned poultry; Plum baby food and snacks; V8 juices and beverages; and Campbell’s tomato juice. The segment also includes the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages business in Latin America; and

The segment also includes our European chips business.

In 2020, our business in Latin America is managed as part of the Snacks segment. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our reportable segments.
Ingredients and Packaging 
The ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers. These items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price volatility, we use a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts, inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons, we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons. In addition, certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by tariffs. At this time, we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses. For information on the impact of inflation, see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Customers 
In most of our markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force and/or third-party brokers and distribution partners. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America, our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores, e-commerce and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. Each of Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance also has a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. We make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders. 
Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019, 46% in 2018 and 47% in 2017. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019, 22% in 2018 and 24% 2017. The Kroger Co. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019 and 10% in 2018 and 2017. Both of our reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates and The Kroger Co. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. 
Trademarks and Technology 
As of September 18, 2019, we owned over 3,600 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries. We believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We believe that our principal brands, including Campbell's, Cape Cod, Chunky, Emerald, Goldfish, Kettle Brand, Lance, Late July, Milano, Pace, Pacific Foods, Pepperidge Farm, Plum, Pop Secret, Prego, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Snyder's of Hanover, Swanson, and V8, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. 
Although we own a number of valuable patents, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own copyrights, both registered and unregistered, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Competition 
We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. Private label products are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and e-commerce. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. Our principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. 
Working Capital 
For information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items, see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
Capital Expenditures 
During 2019, our aggregate capital expenditures were $384 million. We expect to spend approximately $350 million for capital projects in 2020, which includes capital projects for Campbell International for the anticipated period of ownership. Major capital projects based on planned spend in 2020 include implementation of an SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance and a new manufacturing line for our snacks business. 
Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the U.S. In addition, the current U.S. administration has implemented and is considering tariffs on certain imported commodities, including steel. In response, other countries have adopted and/or are considering countervailing tariffs on imported food and agriculture products. 
Environmental Matters 
We have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of our $384 million in capital expenditures made during 2019, approximately $29 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. We further estimate that approximately $13 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2020 will be for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations. We believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. In addition, we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.
Seasonality 
Demand for soup products is seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume. Demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. 
Employees 
On July 28, 2019, we had approximately 19,000 employees, which included approximately 4,200 employees of Campbell International.
