Narrative Description of Business
 
The Eastern Company manages industrial businesses that design, manufacture and sell unique engineered solutions to niche markets. We believe Eastern's businesses operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities and face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence. We look to acquire businesses that produce stable and growing earnings and cash flows. Eastern may pursue acquisitions in industries other than those in which its divisions currently operate if an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity.

Eastern focuses on proactive financial, operational, and strategic management of its businesses in order to increase cash generation, operating earnings and long-term shareholder value. Among other things, Eastern monitors financial and operational performance of each of its businesses and instills consistent financial discipline. Eastern's management analyzes and pursues prudent organic growth strategies and works to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities.
 
In addition, Eastern recruits and retains talented managers to operate its businesses.  We look for leaders who are accountable, maintain cost discipline, act quickly, and build strong followership.
 
The Company operates in three business segments: Industrial Hardware, Security Products and Metal Products.
 
Industrial Hardware
 
The Industrial Hardware segment consists of Eberhard Manufacturing, Eberhard Hardware Manufacturing Ltd., Eastern Industrial Ltd, Velvac Holdings, Canadian Commercial Vehicles Corporation, Composite Panel Technologies and Sesamee Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. These businesses design, manufacture and market a diverse product line of custom and standard vehicular and industrial hardware, including passenger restraint and vehicular locks, latches, hinges, mirrors, mirror-cameras, light-weight sleeper boxes and truck bodies. These products can be found on tractor-trailer trucks, specialty commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, fire and rescue vehicles, school buses, military vehicles and other vehicles. The segment also designs and manufactures a wide selection of fasteners and other closure devices used to secure access doors on various types of industrial equipment such as metal cabinets, machinery housings and electronic instruments. In addition, we invest in the continued introduction of new or improved product designs and we expand into synergistic product lines in order to maintain and increase market share.  The segment sells directly to original equipment manufacturers ("OEM's") and to distributors through in-house sales personnel and outside sales representatives. Sales, customer engineering and customer service are primarily provided through in-house sales personnel and engineering staff. We believe that in order to service these markets, our divisions offer competitive engineering design, service, quality and price.
Security Products
 
The Security Products segment consists of Illinois Lock Company/CCL Security Products, World Lock Company Ltd., Dongguan Reeworld Security Products Ltd., World Security Industries Ltd., Greenwald Industries ("Greenwald"), and Argo EMS (formerly Argo Transdata).  Illinois Lock Company/CCL Security Products, known in the market as ILC, is a global leader in the design and manufacture of engineered security and access solutions in the form of mechanical, electronic and wireless products.  ILC employs an 80/20 business philosophy to drive focus and efficiency in its end-markets, customers, products and manufacturing processes.  ILC focuses on the industrial, vehicle accessory, outdoor recreational equipment, medical, and point of sale and vending segments.  These products and solutions are specified and sold to OEM's, contract equipment manufacturers ("CEM's"), and industrial distributors globally.  Greenwald designs, manufactures and markets payment systems and coin security products used primarily in the commercial laundry market. Greenwald's products include timers, drop meters, coin chutes, money boxes, meter cases, mobile payment apps, smart cards, value transfer stations, smart card readers, card management software, and access control units.  Argo EMS supplies printed circuit boards and other electronic assemblies to original equipment manufacturers in various industries, including measurement systems, semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and industrial controls, medical and military products. The Security Products segment continuously evaluates markets, technology and customer requests to develop growth strategies for the future.
Metal Products
 
The Company believes that its Metal Products segment, based at the Company's Frazer & Jones facility in Solvay, New York, is the largest and most efficient producer of expansion shells for use in supporting the roofs of underground mines in North America. This segment also manufactures specialty malleable and ductile iron castings.  Typical products include mine roof support anchors, couplers for railroad braking systems, support anchoring for construction and couplers/fittings for utility (oil, water and gas) industries. Mine roof support anchors are sold to bolt manufacturers while specialty castings are sold to original equipment manufacturers or machine houses.

General
 
The Company obtains materials from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. Raw materials and outside services were readily available for all of the Company's segments during 2018 and are expected to be readily available in 2019 and the foreseeable future. In in the first half of 2018 and during 2017, the Company experienced price increases for many of the raw materials used in producing its products, including: scrap iron, stainless steel, hot and cold rolled steel, and aluminum.  Since mid-2018, the Company has seen a reduction in zinc and brass raw material prices but expects steel to continue to increase as demand for raw materials increases as the global economy grows.  These raw material cost increases could negatively impact the Company's gross margin if raw material prices increase too rapidly for the Company to recover those cost increases through either price increases to our customers or cost reductions in other areas of the business.
 
Effective September 24, 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the "USTR") imposed 10% tariffs on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.  The impact of the 10% tariffs on Chinese produced goods has been negligible in 2018 as the majority of the tariffs have been recovered from our customers.  For 2019, the USTR anticipates the level of the additional tariffs to increase to 25% and could expand to include an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports.  If the proposed 25% tariff goes into effect in 2019 on Chinese purchased goods, it could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins if the tariffs cannot be recovered in higher selling prices.  If the proposed 25% tariff on Chinese purchased goods goes into effect in 2019, these tariffs could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins if the tariffs cannot be recovered in the higher selling prices.
 
Patent and trademark protection for the various product lines within the Company is limited, but believed by the Company to be sufficient to protect the Company's competitive positions.  Patent durations are from 4 to 20 years.  No business segment is dependent on any patent nor would the loss of any patent have any material adverse effect on the Company's business.
 
None of the Company's segments are seasonal.
 
Customers for all segments are broad-based geographically and by markets, and sales are generally not highly concentrated by customer.  Foreign sales are not significant.  No one customer exceeded 10% of total consolidated sales in 2018 or 2017.
 
The dollar amount of the backlog of orders received by the Company increased as of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Such backlogs were $46,888,000 at December 29, 2018, as compared to $34,991,000 at December 30, 2017.  The primary reasons for the change from 2017 to 2018 were significant backlog increases at Eberhard Manufacturing, Velvac, Argo EMS, and Frazer & Jones and the timing of orders received from customers.
 
The Company encounters competition in all of its business segments. Imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low cost labor have created additional pricing pressure. The Company competes successfully by offering high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis. To compete, the Company deploys internal engineering resources, maintains cost effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly-owned Asian subsidiaries, expands its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintains sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders.
 
The Company does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations are likely to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 
The average number of fulltime employees in 2018 was 1,327.
 
The Company's ratio of working capital to sales improved to 30.3% in 2018 from 33.7% in 2017. The improvement in working capital was the result of increased sales activity and our continued commitment to reducing our working capital.  Working capital includes cash held in various foreign subsidiaries.  With the passage of recent tax legislation cash previously held in foreign countries can be repatriated back to the United States and used for other business needs thus reducing working capital further.  Other factors affecting working capital include our average days' sales in accounts receivable, inventory turnover ratio and payment of vendor accounts payable.  In some cases, the company must hold extra inventory due to extended lead time in receiving products ordered from our foreign subsidiaries to ensure product is available for our customers.  The Company continues to monitor its working capital needs with the goal of reducing our ratio of working capital to sales.
