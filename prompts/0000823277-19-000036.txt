ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
THE COMPANY
CHS Inc. (referred to herein as "CHS," "we," "us" or "our") is the nation’s leading integrated agricultural cooperative, providing grain, foods and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global basis. As a cooperative, we are owned by farmers and ranchers and their member cooperatives (referred to herein as "members") across the United States. We also have preferred shareholders that own shares of our five series of preferred stock, which are each listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. We buy commodities from and provide products and services to individual agricultural producers, local cooperatives and other companies (including our members and other non-member customers), both domestically and internationally. We provide a wide variety of products and services, ranging from initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products to agricultural outputs that include grains and oilseeds, grain and oilseed processing, renewable fuels and food products. A portion of our operations are conducted through equity investments and joint ventures whose operating results are not fully consolidated with our results; rather, a proportionate share of the income or loss from those equity investments and joint ventures is included as a component of our net income using the equity method of accounting. For the year ended August 31, 2019, our total revenues were $31.9 billion and net income attributable to CHS Inc. was $829.9 million.
We have aligned our segments based on an assessment of how our businesses operate and the products and services they sell. Our Energy segment derives its revenues through refining, wholesaling and retailing of petroleum products. Our Ag segment derives its revenues through origination and marketing of grain, including service activities conducted at export terminals; through wholesale agronomy sales of crop nutrient and crop protection products; from sales of soybean meal, soybean refined oil and soyflour products; through the production and marketing of renewable fuels; and through retail sales of petroleum and agronomy products, processed sunflowers, feed and farm supplies. Our Ag segment also records equity income from our grain export joint venture and other investments. Our Nitrogen Production segment consists solely of our equity method investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC ("CF Nitrogen"). Our other business operations, primarily our financing and hedging businesses, are included in Corporate and Other because of the nature of their products and services, as well as the relative amount of revenues for those businesses. Prior to its sale on May 4, 2018, our insurance business was also included in Corporate and Other. In addition, our non-consolidated wheat milling and food production and distribution joint ventures are included in Corporate and Other. 
Our earnings from cooperative business are allocated to members (and to a limited extent to non-members with which we have agreed to do business on a patronage basis) based on the volume of business they do with us. We allocate these earnings to our patrons in the form of patronage refunds (which are also called patronage dividends), which may be in cash, patrons’ equities (in the form of capital equity certificates) or both. Patrons' equities may be redeemed over time solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Earnings derived from non-members, which are not treated as patronage, are taxed at federal and state statutory corporate rates and are retained by us as unallocated capital reserves. We also receive patronage refunds from the cooperatives in which we are a member, if those cooperatives have earnings to distribute and if we qualify for patronage refunds from them.
Our origins date back to the early 1930s with the founding of our predecessor companies, Cenex, Inc. and Harvest States Cooperatives. CHS Inc. emerged as the result of the merger of those two entities in 1998, and is headquartered in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota.

ENERGY
Overview
We are the nation's largest cooperative energy company based on revenues and identifiable assets, with operations that include petroleum refining and pipelines; supply, marketing and distribution of refined fuels (gasoline, diesel fuel and other energy products); blending, sale and distribution of lubricants; and wholesale supply of propane and other natural gas liquids. Our Energy segment processes crude oil into refined petroleum products at our refineries in Laurel, Montana and McPherson, Kansas and sells those products under the Cenex® brand to member cooperatives and other independent retailers through a network of nearly 1,500 sites, the majority of which are convenience stores marketing Cenex branded fuels and owned by our member cooperatives. For fiscal 2019, our Energy revenues, after elimination of intersegment revenues, were $7.1 billion and were primarily from gasoline and diesel fuel.
Operations
Laurel refinery. Our Laurel, Montana, refinery processes medium- and high-sulfur crude oil into refined petroleum products that primarily include gasoline, diesel fuel, petroleum coke and asphalt. Our Laurel refinery sources approximately 93% of its crude oil supply from Canada, with the remaining balance obtained from domestic sources, and we have access to Canadian and northwest Montana crude oil through our wholly-owned Front Range Pipeline, LLC and other common carrier pipelines. Our Laurel refinery also has access to Wyoming crude oil via common carrier pipelines from the south.
Our Laurel refinery processes approximately 61,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce refined products that consist of approximately 43% gasoline, 41% diesel fuel and other distillates, 8% asphalt, 7% petroleum coke and 1% other products. Refined fuels produced at our Laurel refinery are available via rail cars and via the Yellowstone Pipeline to western Montana terminals and to Spokane, Washington; south via common carrier pipelines to Wyoming terminals and Denver, Colorado; and east via our wholly-owned Cenex Pipeline, LLC, to Glendive, Montana, and Minot, Prosper and Fargo, North Dakota.
McPherson refinery. Our McPherson, Kansas, refinery processes approximately 61% low- and medium-sulfur crude oil and approximately 39% heavy-sulfur crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel and other distillates, propane and other products. The refinery sources its crude oil through its own pipelines, as well as common carrier pipelines. Low- and medium-sulfur crude oil is sourced from Kansas, Colorado, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas, and heavy-sulfur crude oil is sourced from Canada and Wyoming.
Our McPherson refinery processes approximately 110,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce refined products that consist of approximately 52% gasoline, 42% diesel fuel and other distillates, 2% propane and 4% other products. These products are loaded into trucks at the McPherson refinery or shipped via common carrier pipelines to other markets.
Other energy operations. We operate six propane terminals, four asphalt terminals, seven refined product terminals and three lubricants blending and packaging facilities. We also own and lease a fleet of liquid and pressure trailers and tractors, which transport refined fuels, propane, anhydrous ammonia and other products.
Products and Services
Our Energy segment produces and sells (primarily wholesale) gasoline, diesel fuel, propane, asphalt, lubricants and other related products, and also provides transportation services. In addition to selling products refined at our Laurel and McPherson refineries, we purchase refined petroleum products from third parties. For fiscal 2019, we obtained approximately 70% of the refined petroleum products we sold from our Laurel and McPherson refineries and approximately 30% from third parties.
Sales and Marketing; Customers
We market approximately 80% of our refined fuel products to members, with the balance sold to non-members. Sales are made wholesale to member cooperatives and through a network of independent retailers that operate convenience stores under the Cenex brand. We sold approximately 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline and approximately 1.7 billion gallons of diesel fuel in fiscal 2019. We also blend, package and wholesale auto and farm machinery lubricants to both members and non-members. We are one of the nation’s largest propane wholesalers based on revenues. Most of the propane sold in rural areas is for heating and agricultural usage. Annual sales volumes of propane vary greatly depending on weather patterns and crop conditions.

Industry; Competition
The petroleum business is highly cyclical. Demand for crude oil and energy products is driven by the condition of local and worldwide economies, local and regional weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources, which can significantly affect the price of refined fuel products. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and profitability in certain operating areas, such as refined products, in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel usage by our agricultural customers is highest and is subject to domestic supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and profitability during the winter heating and crop-drying seasons. More fuel-efficient equipment, reduced crop tillage, depressed prices for crops, weather conditions and government programs that encourage idle acres may all reduce demand for our energy products.
Regulation. Governmental regulations and policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on our Energy segment. Our Energy segment’s operations are subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment that are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; transportation, handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; labeling of pesticides and similar substances; and investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible recalls of products. Our hedging transactions and activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and governing bodies, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME"), the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC").
Competition. The petroleum refining and wholesale fuels business is very competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world’s largest integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil supplies, distribution and marketing systems. We also compete with smaller domestic refiners and marketers in the midwestern and northwestern United States, with foreign refiners who import products into the United States and with producers and marketers in other industries supplying other forms of energy and fuels to consumers. Given the commodity nature of the end products, profitability in the industry depends largely on margins, as well as operating efficiency, product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation. The retail gasoline market is highly competitive, with competitors that are much larger than us and that have greater brand recognition and distribution outlets throughout the country and the world than we do. We are also experiencing increased competition from regional and unbranded retailers. Our owned and non-owned retail outlets are located primarily in the northwestern, midwestern and southern United States.
We market refined fuel products in five principal geographic areas. The first area includes the Midwest and Northern Plains. Competition at the wholesale level in this area includes major oil companies, as well as independent refiners and wholesale brokers/suppliers. This area has a robust spot market and is influenced by the large refinery center along the Gulf Coast.
To the east of the Midwest and Northern Plains is another unique marketing area. This area centers near Chicago, Illinois, and includes eastern Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. In this area, we principally compete with the major oil companies, as well as independent refiners and wholesale brokers/suppliers.
Another market area includes Arkansas, Missouri and the northern part of Texas. Competition in this area includes the major oil companies and independent refiners. This area is principally supplied from the Gulf Coast refinery center and is also driven by a strong spot market that reacts quickly to changes in the international and national supply balance.
Another geographic area includes Montana, western North Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Colorado and western South Dakota. Competition at the wholesale level in this area includes the major oil companies and independent refiners.
The last area includes much of Washington and Oregon. We compete with the major oil companies in this area. This area is known for volatile prices and an active spot market.

AG
Overview
Our Ag segment includes our global grain marketing, country operations, wholesale agronomy, processing and food ingredients and renewable fuels businesses. These businesses work together to facilitate the production, purchase, sale and eventual use of grain and other agricultural products within the United States, as well as internationally. In fiscal 2019, revenues in our Ag segment were $24.7 billion after elimination of intersegment revenues, consisting principally of grain sales.
Operations
Global grain marketing. We are the nation’s largest cooperative marketer of grain and oilseed based on grain sales. Our global grain marketing operations purchase grain directly from agricultural producers and elevator operators primarily in the midwestern and western United States and indirectly through our country operations business. The purchased grain is typically contracted for sale for future delivery at a specified location, and we are responsible for handling the grain and either arranging for or facilitation of its transportation to that location. We own and operate export terminals, river terminals and elevators throughout the United States to handle and transport grain and grain products. We also maintain locations in Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Rim and South America for the marketing, merchandising and/or sourcing of grains and crop nutrients. We primarily conduct our global grain marketing operations directly, but do conduct some of our operations through joint ventures, including TEMCO, LLC, a 50% owned joint venture with Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), focused on exports, primarily to Asia.
Country operations. Our country operations business operates 470 agri-operations locations through 43 business units dispersed throughout the midwestern and western United States. Most of these locations purchase grain from farmers and sell agronomy, energy, feed and seed products to those same producers and others, although not all locations provide every product and service. We also manufacture animal feed through eight owned plants and three limited liability companies.
Wholesale agronomy. Our wholesale agronomy business includes our wholesale crop nutrients and wholesale crop protection businesses. Our wholesale crop nutrients business delivers products directly to our customers and our country operations business from the manufacturer or through our 18 inland and river warehouse terminals and other non-owned storage facilities located throughout the United States. To supplement what is purchased domestically, our Galveston, Texas, deep-water port and terminal receives fertilizer by vessel from origins such as Asia and the Caribbean Basin where significant volumes of urea are produced. The fertilizer is then shipped by rail to destinations within crop-producing regions of the United States. Our wholesale crop protection business operates out of our network of 32 warehouses from which we deliver products directly to our member cooperatives and independent retailers. We also operate a bulk chemical rail terminal in Brooten, Minnesota, where we handle and store bulk crop protection products for some of the crop protection industry’s largest chemical manufacturers. This facility has approximately 6 million gallons of chemical storage capacity.
Processing and food ingredients. Our processing and food ingredients operations are conducted at facilities that can crush approximately 128 million bushels of oilseeds on an annual basis, producing approximately 2.8 million short tons of meal/flour and 1.5 billion pounds of edible oil annually. We purchase our oilseeds from members, other CHS businesses and third parties that have tightly integrated connections with our global grain marketing operations and country operations business. 
Renewable fuels. Our renewable fuels business produces 266 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol and 662 thousand tons of dried distillers grains with solubles ("DDGS") annually. Renewable fuels produced by our production plants are marketed by our global grain marketing business, along with more than 520 million gallons of ethanol and 4.5 million tons of DDGS annually under marketing agreements with ethanol production plants. 
Products and Services
Our Ag segment provides local cooperatives and farmers with the inputs and services they need to produce grain and raise livestock. These include seed, crop nutrients, crop protection products, animal feed, animal health products, refined fuels and propane. We also buy and merchandise grain in both domestic and international markets. With a portion of the grain we purchase we produce renewable fuels, including ethanol and DDGS. We also produce refined oils, meal and soyflour at our processing facilities.
4

Sales and Marketing; Customers
Our Ag segment provides products and services to a wide range of customers, primarily in the United States. These customers include member and non-member producers, local cooperatives, elevators, grain dealers, grain processors and crop nutrient retailers. We sell our edible oils and soyflour to food companies. The meal we produce is sold to integrated livestock producers and feed mills. The ethanol and DDGS we produce are sold throughout the United States and to various international locations. 
Industry; Competition
Many of the business activities in our Ag segment are highly seasonal and, consequently, the operating results for our Ag segment will typically vary throughout the year. For example, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and income during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons and our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and income during the spring planting season. In addition, our Ag segment operations may be adversely affected by relative levels of supply and demand, both domestic and international, commodity price levels and transportation costs and conditions. Supply is affected by weather conditions, plant disease, insect damage, acreage planted and government regulations and policies. Demand may be affected by foreign governments and their programs, relationships of foreign countries with the United States, affluence of foreign countries, acts of war, currency exchange fluctuations and substitution of commodities. Demand may also be affected by changes in eating habits, population growth, per capita consumption of some products and renewable fuels production levels. 
Regulation. Our Ag operations are subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment that are administered by the EPA, the DOT and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; transportation, handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; labeling of pesticides and similar substances; and investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. In addition, environmental laws impose a liability on owners and operators for investigation and remediation of contaminated property and on a party who sends hazardous materials to those contaminated properties for treatment, storage, disposal or recycling. In some instances, that liability exists regardless of fault. Our global grain marketing operations, country operations business, processing and food ingredient operations and renewable fuel operations are also subject to laws and related regulations and rules administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies that govern processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of feed and grain products. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible recalls of products. The hedging transactions and activities of our global grain marketing, country operations, processing and food ingredient and renewable fuels businesses are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and governing bodies, such as the CME, the Chicago Board of Trade ("CBOT"), the Minneapolis Grain Exchange ("MGEX") and the CFTC.
Competition. In our Ag segment, we have significant competition in the businesses in which we operate based principally on price, services, quality, patronage and alternative products. Our businesses depend on relationships with local cooperatives and private retailers, proximity to customers and producers, and competitive pricing. We compete with other large distributors of agricultural products, as well as other regional or local distributors, local cooperatives, retailers and manufacturers. 
NITROGEN PRODUCTION
Overview

Our Nitrogen Production segment consists solely of our approximate 10% membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen, our strategic venture with CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ("CF Industries"). In February 2016, in connection with our investment in CF Nitrogen, we entered into an 80-year supply agreement with CF Nitrogen that entitles us to purchase up to 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") annually for ratable delivery. We account for our CF Nitrogen investment using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method and on August 31, 2019, our investment was approximately $2.7 billion.
Our investment in CF Nitrogen positions us and our members for long-term dependable fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency and production economics. In addition, the ability to source product from CF Nitrogen production facilities under our supply agreement benefits our members and customers through strategically positioned access to essential fertilizer products.
