ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Flora Growth Corp. was incorporated on March 13, 2019, under the laws of the Province of Ontario. We are a multi-national cannabis company that manufactures and distributes consumer packaged goods, cultivates and distributes medicinal cannabis, and distributes pharmaceutical products.

Mission

Flora exists to create a world where the benefits of cannabis are accessible to everyone.

These transactions included the acquisition of our interests in Flora Labs 1, 2 and 4 (hereinafter defined), our Cosechemos cultivation and processing facility and a number of brands.

Since our IPO, Flora has acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests in each of:


· | Franchise Global Health Inc. (“Franchise”), who together with its principal subsidiary, Phatebo GmbH (“Phatebo”) is a multi-national operator in the pharmaceutical and medical cannabis industries, with principal operations in Germany; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Just Brands LLC (“JBL”) and High Roller Private Label LLC (“HRPL”) based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. JBL is a leading distributor and retailer of cannabidiol (CBD) derived products through its widely recognized “JustCBD” brand. HRPL (which we refer to as Flora Lab 3) manufactures several of the leading products sold by JBL; and
· | Vessel Brand Inc. (“VBI”), a developer and retailer of high-end cannabis consumer technologies and accessories operating under its flagship brand “Vessel.”

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is built on three core pillars: House of Brands (HoB), Commercial & Wholesale, and Pharmaceutical.  This strategy was devised to allow us optimal access to markets around the globe based on the legal standing of cannabis in each of the geographical locations in which we operate. Our approach has enabled us to develop distribution networks, build customer bases establish operations as the regulatory framework evolves and allow for expanded access to cannabis and its derivatives. Furthermore, our strategy seeks to diversify our overall business, provide near-, mid- and long-term opportunities within revenue streams, de-risk our exposure to regulatory impediments and accelerate our ability to gain market share in the cannabis industry.
House of Brands

Our brand portfolio consists of a mix of products across multiple categories including food and beverage, nutraceuticals, cannabis accessories and technology, personal care and wellness.  Consumer brands allow Flora to move assertively into nascent markets, develop customer bases and distribution channels and gather consumer insights which would not be possible with traditional cannabis sales alone.  Through this channel we seek to build loyalty, credibility and enjoy healthy margins that help to support the rapid growth of our business. 

JustCBD

JustCBD is Flora’s leading consumer packaged goods brand. JustCBD was launched in 2017 with a mission to bring high-quality, trustworthy and budget-friendly CBD products to market. The JustCBD offering currently consists of over 350 products across 15 categories, including CBD gummies, topicals, tinctures, and vape products and ships to over 11,500 independent retailers worldwide. JustCBD also sells direct to consumers with a customer base of approximately 350,000 people. JustCBD products are available for purchase in smoke and vape shops, clinics, spas and pet stores, as well as other independent non-traditional retail channels. JustCBD’s products are both internally and third-party lab-tested to ensure quality. 

Vessel

Vessel is Flora’s cannabis accessory and technology brand currently servicing the United States and Canada through direct-to-consumer and retail sales. Vessel’s products include cannabis consumption accessories, personal storage and travel accessories for the vape and dry herb categories, which are sold to consumers, dispensaries, smoke shops and cannabis brands. Vessel has positioned itself as a lifestyle brand, developing products for key consumer personas interested in “elevating” the consumption experience, focusing primarily on the direct-to-consumer business and have garnered a customer base of approximately 150,000 people.  Since our acquisition of VBI in November 2021, Vessel has been fully integrated into JBL and now benefits from operational, logistical and sales synergies with JustCBD. 
Mambe

Mambe is Flora’s food and beverage brand with a focus in Latin America, offering infused natural fruit juices and canned goods. The brand operates on a business-to-business model, where we sell to both distributors and retail businesses. Over the last three years, Mambe has expanded its distribution in Colombia, primarily in supermarkets, discount retailers, coffee shops, restaurants and airports. Mambe’s list of clients include well-known Colombian retailers Juan Valdez, Jumbo, Sipote Burrito and Xue. 

Other brands

In addition to the brands set forth above, Flora has a curated portfolio of niche brands that focus on target audiences and specialty offerings. The revenue contribution of these brands is currently immaterial to our overall business; however, they allow Flora to further diversify its revenue streams, bolster white label capabilities and offer a broader ecosystem for cross selling. Additional brands in our portfolio include: Mind Naturals (skincare), Stardog Loungewear (apparel), No Cap Hemp Co (minor cannabinoids), KaLaya (skincare) and Original Hemp (e-commerce).

Flora Lab 3

Located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Flora Lab 3 provides manufacturing capabilities to our HoB portfolio and primarily focuses on the manufacturing of ingestible gummies and tinctures for our JustCBD brand as well as for white label clients. This facility contains a lab for research and development, a drying room, a warehouse area, automated packaging lines for gummies and bottling lines for tinctures, topicals, and other bottled products. In addition, Flora Lab 3 also conducts in-house potency testing to test the efficacy of products produced.  
Commercial & Wholesale

Our Commercial and Wholesale pillar encompasses the cultivation, transformation and movement of cannabis and the distribution of pharmaceutical products to international markets. This pillar is anchored by Flora’s wholly owned subsidiary, Phatebo, a multi-national operator in pharmaceutical and medical cannabis distribution, with principal operations in Germany, and Cosechemos, our 249-acre licensed cultivation facility in Girón, Colombia.  Cosechemos is also the site for Flora Lab 1, a transformation facility where the Company is able to produce high-THC and high-CBD flower and derivatives for medical products in Colombia and export to countries around the globe. 
Phatebo

Through our acquisition of Franchise, we acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary, Phatebo.  Based in Germany, Phatebo is a wholesale pharmaceutical distribution company with import and export capabilities of a wide range of pharmaceutical goods and medical cannabis products to treat a variety of health indications, including drugs related to cancer therapies, ADHD, multiple sclerosis and anti-depressants, among others. Phatebo holds a License for the Trade in Narcotic Drugs (including the cannabis sales license amendment) and a Wholesale Trading License, both of which are issued by BfArM (the largest drug approval authority in Europe). Phatebo is focused on distributing pharmaceutical products within 28 countries globally, primarily in Europe, but also with sales to Asia, Latin America, and North America.  Neither Franchise, Phatebo, nor their direct or indirect subsidiaries, have direct, indirect or ancillary involvement in the cannabis industry in the United States. In November 2018, Phatebo also received a medical cannabis import and distribution license.  We intend to leverage Phatebo’s existing network of approximately 1,200 pharmacies as Flora begins to move medicinal cannabis from our Cosechemos facility and third parties into Germany. Additionally, the Phatebo warehouse provides a logistics outpost for Flora’s growing product portfolio and distribution network within the European Union.
Cosechemos

Located 3,000 feet above sea level in Girón, Colombia, Flora’s 361-acre farm has 249-licensed acres available for high-THC and high-CBD cultivation. With a bi-annual quota of 44,000 kgs of psychoactive cannabis issued by the Colombian government, Flora can grow, harvest, transform and distribute its harvest to around the world where medical cannabis is legal.  Some of the key aspects of our Cosechemos farm include:

· | Breeding – For the implementation of our genetic improvement program and to obtain propagation material (seed, cuttings, in vitro plants), Cosechemos includes a greenhouse of 1,520 square meters, open field area (area of crosses and evaluation of genetic material), reproduction laboratories and plans to implement a tissue culture lab in the future. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Propagation Center – A 16,361 sq ft greenhouse which has the capacity to produce 23,000 root cuttings weekly. The primary function of the propagation center is to develop and propagate a steady stream of genetically identical cuttings (clones) that supply our cultivation lots, where they grow into flowering plants that eventually yield the harvested cannabis flower at our drying and processing center.
· | Warehouse – A 1,614 sq ft warehouse for the housing and storage of all equipment required at the farm. 
· | Housing for Technical Team – A 1,100 sq ft of residential quarters to host our technical team. Four members of the technical team reside at the farm to ensure that its crops have constant surveillance. 
· | Fertilization Center – We have constructed three fertilization centers, each approximately 1,100 sq ft, which contain the fertilization infrastructure and equipment needed for the farm, including pumping system, filters and automation tanks. 
· | Deep Water Well – We completed a 328-foot deep well in March 2023, as an additional source of water to be stored in the water reservoir (see below). 
· | Water Reservoir – Flora maintains multiple water reservoirs which have a capacity of approximately 30,000 cubic meters of water. The water reservoirs are filled with water from the underground aquifer and the deep well. 
· | Flora constructed a helicopter pad that allows individuals or supplies to be moved to and from the farm. It takes approximately five minutes to fly by helicopter from the farm and Palonegro International Airport in Lebrija.

Flora Lab 1

Consisting of approximately 11,500 sq ft and located on site at our Cosechemos facility, Flora Lab 1 is comprised of: (i) flower automated drying machines, (ii) a grinding and milling area, (iii) extraction areas, and (iv) a phytocannabinoid quality control laboratory, a soil laboratory, a phytopathology laboratory and a beneficial microorganism multiplication laboratory. Flora Lab 1 is designed to be capable of processing the Company’s perpetually harvested cultivation. The facility is also designed to be expandable and able to process cultivation up to the fully-licensed acreage. We may expand the processing capabilities of our Flora Lab 1 over time as market demand increases. 

Through the low-cost cultivation of high-THC and high-CBD flower, the ability to transform the raw biomass into finished goods and derivatives and move these products through existing multinational distribution networks, we believe the Company has built the necessary infrastructure to support the export and import of cannabis in key global markets as the trade moves away from geo-fenced, regional activities to international supply chain adoption.

Pharmaceutical

Flora’s Pharmaceutical pillar is focused on developing pharmaceutical grade products and providing scientific research connected to molecules found in the cannabis plant. Through this pillar, Flora works to provide access to medical cannabis, create awareness through education and initiate research studies for use in targeted and broad-based use cases leveraging multiple modalities. Our pharmaceutical pillar is anchored by Flora Lab 2 and Flora Lab 4, both of which are located in Bogota, Colombia. These laboratories allow us to manufacture plant-based, medical-grade pharmaceuticals, phytotherapeutics, and dietary supplements. 

Flora is currently working on a study in conjunction with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to assess the benefits of a proprietary CBD formulation on patients suffering from musculoskeletal pain. The study will rely on a novel measurable pain technology using an electroencephalogram, commonly referred to as an “EEG,” to collect data alongside traditional pain reporting measures. All pre-clinical and safety data is complete and has been submitted for approval by the National Health Service (“NHS”) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”). 

Flora Lab 2

Flora Lab 2 is our 16,000 sq ft facility in Bogota, Colombia which holds three GMP licenses. This facility was built to formulate over the counter (OTC) phytotherapeutics, cosmetics and nutraceuticals for owned brands, third party distribution and white label customers. Distribution relies on large channel distributors, including pharmacies, medical clinics and cosmetic companies. Flora Lab 2 sources the majority of its raw materials within Colombia and the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are supplied by both Colombian and international companies from various countries including the United States, China and Germany.
Flora Lab 4

Flora Lab 4 is our 2,300 sq ft state of the art lab located in Bogota, Colombia. Construction of Flora Lab 4 was completed during the fourth quarter of 2022. The laboratory was designed to house Flora’s proprietary custom cannabis formulations that were developed to treat targeted ailments such as anxiety, insomnia and pain. These medicines are expected to be available soon by doctor’s prescription and covered by health insurance providers in Colombia. Flora lab 4 is expecting its INVIMA certification (Colombia’s Food and Drug regulatory agency) in the first quarter of 2023 and expects to commence sales shortly thereafter.

Our Competitive Strengths 

Due to the competitive and dynamic nature of the emerging cannabis products market and rapid changes in the regulatory environment, Flora does recognize the need to remain flexible, so we can react to opportunities and risks as they develop. Management will continue to re-evaluate and re-prioritize strategies to respond to these developments. We are actively fostering a culture of continued agility and exploration since the ability to pivot depending on market dynamics can result in a competitive advantage.

A diversified strategy

We believe that our growth strategy is our main competitive advantage. By creating our three-pillar approach that addresses the bell curve of the future cannabis industry; consumer packaged goods, commercial cannabis supply chain experience, and cannabis prescription medication, Flora creates a moat, playing brand, vendor, and distributor of a broad collection of cannabis products, owned and brokered, suitable for markets around the world. 

Supply chain experience

Flora is continually developing the ability and expertise to move cannabis across the global supply chain in multiple business categories. The cannabis supply chain is complex and has high barriers of entry. Our team has been able to develop a strong understanding of distribution across the globe. 

Regulatory expertise

Flora has the necessary regulatory requirements to fulfill needs across the global supply chain. Some of these requirements, such as cultivation licenses and grow quotas, take several years to acquire.

Global positioning

Flora’s main operations are located in the United States, Germany and Colombia. We believe these countries have a pro-cannabis stance and are poised to grow in market size and demand for the product categories in which we operate, especially as regulatory changes, such as recreational cannabis legalization in Germany and Colombia, are signed into law. As we expand our reach, a critical part of our growth has been to create pathways to emerging markets and new geographies. We achieve this through one of three ways: distribution partners primarily lead by our HoB division, mergers and acquisitions activity or creating Company owned outposts in critical areas. This approach allows us to scale our presence in markets with meaningful opportunity and take advantage of evolving regulatory frameworks in near real time.

Experienced management team 

With a management team with diverse backgrounds that include public company management, early-stage cannabis, big box and mainstream retail, consumer packaged goods and technology services, Flora believes the right talent has been assembled to take advantage of the opportunities presented in the cannabis industry. Management expects that its experience and strong understanding of regulatory frameworks, the agricultural and scientific processes necessary to develop high quality and consistent medicinal cannabis products, as well as the knowledge and expertise in go to market strategy for its portfolio of brands, will continue to set the Company up for success.

Growth Tactics 

Flora’s goal is to become a market leader in the cultivation, processing and distribution of natural, medicinal-grade cannabis and high-quality cannabis derived medical and wellness products for large channel distributors, including pharmacies, medical clinics, and cosmetic companies, by expanding our production capacity, expanding our geographic footprint, continuing to explore strategic partnerships and pursuing accretive acquisitions to supplement our organic growth. 
M&A

Acquisition of businesses both domestically and internationally has played a critical role in the growth of the Company. We continue to seek out M&A targets that are accretive in nature and which provide access to previously untapped capabilities within Flora. Essential to this strategy and the evaluation process will be geography, cash flow, positive earnings, management and human capital.

Expanding production capacity.

In the near term, our primary strategy is to scale our production facility as we see the demand for cannabis grow. Flora currently uses a small portion of our 249-acres of land licensed for the cultivation of psychoactive cannabis at Cosechemos, but given our perpetual harvesting methods, we are able to scale quickly based on demand. Furthermore, we have additional land for the cultivation of non-psychoactive cannabis. Flora may also seek to expand operations through partnerships with other licensed cannabis producing assets.

Supply chain experience

As we look to the future of the cannabis industry, we expect it to be a global trade and those who can master the art of moving cannabis and its derivatives around the world will be the companies who have longevity in the space. At Flora, we seek to master the movement of psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis as well as accessory and ancillary products such that we are not only able to leverage our own Colombian cannabis product but that we are also able to move cannabis products from partners around the globe to the areas of highest demand. As we continue to solidify our place as the “connector of global cannabis” our experience and ultimate mastery of this critical component of the industry will present opportunities for scale not available to others.

Sales and Marketing

Across our various pillars, we sell products through three main channels: direct-to-consumer, wholesale and retail.  In HoB, sales are primarily focused on direct-to-consumer sales through brand websites and wholesale retail partners and are concentrated in the United States. Our international HoB sales are conducted primary through distribution partners who sell to third party retailers.

In the Commercial & Wholesale pillar, we are building our own supply chain to sell cannabis products to distributors, pharmacies and licensed retailers.

Our Pharmaceutical pillar relies primarily on prescribing doctor networks and pharmacy sales. 

Due to the nature of the products we sell in each pillar, marketing primarily relies on organic reach on traditional social channels, direct email communications and educational content production. Paid advertising does not play a meaningful role in our marketing activities.

Distribution

United States

Distribution activities in the United States are primarily run from our Fort Lauderdale, Florida office and warehouse where all US-based HoB products are housed. Distribution activities include storage, direct to consumer fulfillment as well as wholesale direct and third-party distributor shipments.
Germany, UK & Europe

Flora has operations in Germany where we are an importer, exporter and distributor of prescription drugs and EU-GMP medical cannabis. Through leveraging Flora’s facilities and existing infrastructure and extensive distribution network, we expect to be able to source, store and distribute a range of medical cannabis products, which will help support us meet the growing demand for medical cannabis throughout Europe. We operate a distribution facility in Hilzingen, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. 

Flora operates a small sales office in London, England, which serves as a homebase for all HoB activities being conducted in Europe. From this office and a small facility in the Netherlands, Flora is able to support the European distribution and wholesale business for its HoB products. 

Colombia

Distribution in Colombia is comprised of two major categories: Consumer products to fulfill demand in Colombia and flower cultivation for export to countries around the globe. Fulfillment to distribution partners and retailers happens at the factory or laboratory level. Cannabis distribution from the country is facilitated by the team at Cosechemos and leaves the country via Bogota to the legal country of import or to a tolling facility for additional processing.

The Global Cannabis Industry

The global cannabis market is growing at approximately a 16.6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) and projected to reach approximately $51 billion by 20251 globally.  

United States

As Flora is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market that maintains the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis products containing THC, we operate exclusively today in CBD-based or ancillary/accessory businesses in the U.S. market. This includes importing cosmetic and beauty products, accessory and non-cannabinoid products and CBD products.  The U.S. hemp-derived CBD market reached roughly $5 billion in retail sales in 20222 and is expected to grow to $11 billion in 2027. Hemp-derived CBD and its derivatives remain legal at the federal level under the 2018 Farm Bill.

Europe

The European cannabis landscape continues to advance largely with Germany, Malta, Switzerland, Poland and the United Kingdom being the furthest ahead by means of establishing a legal cannabis framework. 

Prohibition Partners, a leading market intelligence firm on the global cannabis industry, estimated that the European cannabis market was roughly $492 million by the end of 2021 and expects to see the market grow at a CAGR of 61.1% from 2021 to reach $13 billion by 2028. Products like CBD edibles continue to be governed by the EU Novel Food Act and as a result provide near term upside for the Company. 

In 2022, Germany, the largest cannabis market in the European Union, announced it would begin the process of moving towards recreational adult-use cannabis in the country in addition to continuing to expand its existing medical cannabis program. The German medical cannabis segment is projected to reach $359.9 million in 2023. Revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 14% between 2023-2027, resulting in a market volume of $607.6 million by 20273.

Colombia

In 2022, the Colombian government passed Resolution 227 and Resolution 539, completing the necessary guidelines for cannabis agriculture and manufacturing proposed in Decree 811. Resolution 227 provides the necessary framework for the use, distribution and export of cannabis, dried flower, and other non-psychoactive derivatives. On April 1, 2022, the Government of Colombia finalized the cannabis flower regulatory checklist under Resolution 539 permitting licensed cannabis cultivators with export quotas, including Flora, to pass a mandatory approval process for the export of both CBD and THC flower.

On January 1, 2022, insurance providers in Colombia were mandated to cover the costs of both THC and CBD medical products. This mandate covers the vast majority of the country’s 55-million-person population. The market for medicinal cannabis in Colombia is evolving with limited supply and few authorized producers of THC dominant cannabis. Management believes that we are competitively positioned to capitalize on our early mover status and to satisfy a significant portion of the market’s demand for medicinal cannabis.

In addition to the existing regulatory framework that had been developing in Colombia, a pro-cannabis president, President Gustavo Petro, was elected in August 2022. President Petro has been vocal in his support for the passage of legal, regulated adult-use cannabis in the country.

Pharmaceutical Market and Health Sector

According to the data reported to the Drug Price Information System, pharmaceutical sales have shown sustained growth in recent years, although in 2019 it grew at the lowest rate since 2015.  In turn, the units sold rose from 1.06 billion in 2018 to 1.08 billion in 2019, showing a 2% increase.  In 2020, drug makers raised prices on more than 860 drugs by around 5%, on average, according to 3 Axis. Drug price increases have slowed substantially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the number of drugs affected. Drug increases come at a time where increased pharmaceutical engineering has moved to fight COVID-19, with many companies exploring CBD as a drug to combat COVID-19.

The health sector in Colombia offers various business opportunities in vaccine and biotechnological drug production centers, as well as in the medical cannabis market. Flora Lab 2 and Flora Lab 4’s research and development teams are exploring how its product line can incorporate cannabis and its derivatives to improve the effectiveness of its products and develop new products and medicines. We believe that Colombia has become a benchmark in this industry as, to our knowledge, one of the first countries to structure a regulatory framework for the safe and informed access to the medical and scientific use of the plant and its derivatives. Furthermore, the chemical sector in Colombia has adopted several international regulations, such as the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).  In addition, Colombia has implemented its own control system for substances that could be used for illegal purposes, and it is currently implementing environmental protection systems such as the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry (PRTR). Despite Colombia’s struggle with counterfeit medicines and restrictive pharmaceutical pricing environment, the country’s large and burgeoning population and recent legislative commitments to improving healthcare access will continue to offer growth opportunities to drug-makers. 

Europe has a strong pharmaceutical history and a thriving industry with concentration of pharmaceutical companies in the German-Switzerland border area. In 2021, Europe made up 23.4% of the global pharmaceutical revenues and the industry has a projected CAGR of 5.4% between 2022 and 2026 resulting in total sales of $295 billion by 20264. In the European Union, Germany was the leading pharmaceutical market with a total revenue of about $52.5 billion in 20215. 

Cannabidiol (CBD) Market

CBD is a non-psychoactive compound found naturally occurring within the cannabis plant with the majority of CBD consumed being derived from the hemp plant. The global CBD market was roughly $4.9 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $47.3 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 21.3% with the U.S. market alone making up an estimated $4.1 billion in product sales in 20226. The CBD market in the United States has seen steady growth with an inflection point occurring with the passage of the 2018 US Farm Bill, clearing the way for CBD and other compounds derived from the hemp plant. The majority of CBD consumers site seeking relief from pain, anxiety and sleep issues as their primary reason for use. In the United States, CBD is readily found in brick-and-mortar stores as well as online. However, advertising remains difficult due to its association with its psychoactive cousin, THC, and the early proliferation of bad-actors making effects-based claims that were not backed by science in order to bolster sales. 

Ancillary/Accessories

The ancillary or accessory category continues to grow as we see the expansion of legal access to cannabis around the globe. The accessory space is broad and spans smoking accessories as well as ash trays and storage pieces. While the primary use for the majority of products Flora produces is cannabis consumption, the majority of consumers do not buy their accessories at legal dispensaries instead relying on smoke shops and online retail. By category, vaping continues to play an outsized role in the accessories market with vaping making up roughly 30% of the $67 billion industry in 2022.  Looking ahead, Future Markets Insights projects the global accessory market will reach $101 billion by 2031, representing a CAGR of 4.2%.

Regulatory

Flora has obtained the necessary licenses to operate on a global scale including required governmental approvals, licenses and permits. A summary of such governmental approvals, licenses and permits are set forth below. Also see “—Our Intellectual Property Portfolio.”

Flora Cultivation Licenses

Import and Export Licenses

Our cultivation farm has received the requisite licenses and permits for the farming, and manufacturing of both psychoactive and non-psychoactive Cannabis derivatives. Flora has also obtained a permit to export both psychoactive and non-psychoactive dry flower, becoming one of the first companies with operations in Colombia to do so. Flora’s cultivation is certified Good Agriculture and Collection Process (“GACP”) and follows organic cultivation methods.
Fuente Semillera License / Registration as a Selected Seed Producer

Prior to December 31, 2018, under article 2.8.11.11.1 of Decree 631 of 2018, licensed cannabis producers had the right to register before the Colombian Agricultural Institute (“ICA”) the genetics of any cannabis strain found in Colombia without having to declare or specify its origin. This right, known as “Fuente semillera”, works a mechanism to legalize the sources of cannabis genetics already existing in Colombia, by allowing licensees to initiate the formal proceedings before the ICA, required to register such genetics in the Colombian National Plants Registry or “Registro Nacional de Cultivares.” In this sense, each strain registered as Fuente semillera belongs to each licensee, giving it the right to grow its own strain of cannabis as opposed to having to purchase registered strain from other licensed producers. Since December 31, 2018, we have registered 12 varieties as our own Fuente semillera. This registration enables Flora to grow its own strain of cannabis as opposed to having to purchase registered strain from other licensed producers. To date, four of our 12 registered varieties have passed the Agronomic Evaluation Test.
Psychoactive Cannabis Cultivation License

On August 22, 2019, the Company applied to the Ministry of Justice and Law for a psychoactive cannabis license (the “Psychoactive Cannabis License”), which initially authorized the cultivation of psychoactive cannabis plants for (i) the production of seeds for planting and (ii) the manufacture of derivatives; but later, the license was modified and currently authorizes the cultivation of psychoactive cannabis for research and export purposes. Besides cultivation, licensees also have an authorization to store, commercialize, distribute and transport psychoactive cannabis plants, as well as dried cannabis flower. Flora obtained this license on March 10, 2021 and received an updated export permit of 43,612.6 kilograms on March 11, 2022. 

As of February 2023, we have modified our quotas as follows:


Flower Export | 29,313.40 kg
-------------------------+-------------
Derivatives Export | 12,279.60 kg
Derivatives Domestic Use | 1,216.70 kg 
Derivatives Research | 1,305.3 kg 
Total | 44,114.90 kg

Cannabis Manufacturing License

On August 14, 2019, Flora applied to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (the “Ministry of Health”) for its cannabis manufacturing license and received the cannabis manufacturing license as of November 9, 2020.

ICA Permit

Flora currently has: (i) Registration as a producer of selected seed granted by the ICA in 2020; (ii) Registration as a Cannabis Breeding Research Unit granted by the ICA in 2020; (iii) Registration as a seed cannabis export granted by the ICA in 2022; (iv) Registration as a seed cannabis import granted by the ICA in 2022. Additionally, since the first quarter of 2022, Flora has registered four varieties of medicinal cannabis in the ICA National Registry of Commercial Cultivars which allows Flora to develop psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis crops for commercial purposes.  Commercial planting and harvests are ongoing at the Cosechemos Farm. 


13

Non-Psychoactive Cannabis License

We applied for a non-psychoactive cannabis license (the “Non-Psychoactive Cannabis License”) on September 6, 2018, and the Ministry of Justice and Law granted it on May 15, 2019, by means of Resolution N° 484 of 2019. Initially, the License of Non-Psychoactive Cultivation granted us the right to cultivate non-psychoactive cannabis plants for: (a) the production of grains and seeds, (b) manufacture of derivatives, and (c) industrial purposes; but later this license was modified and today it also allows us to cultivate non-psychoactive cannabis for research and export purposes. The Non-Psychoactive Cannabis Cultivation License does not require a quota. The license is valid for up to five (5) years and, with the new regulation of Decree 811 of 2021, it can be renewed for an additional period of ten (10) years. The Colombian State maintains the right to monitor the activities carried out by the corresponding licensee.

Flora’s Non-Psychoactive Cannabis License allows for the cultivation, production and distribution of CBD dominant cannabis oils and derivative products for the medicinal cannabis market in Colombia and other low THC non-psychoactive cannabis over-the-counter markets as they arise. In Colombia, there are approximately 500 companies with a Non-Psychoactive Cannabis Cultivation License. 

It is important to note that, in compliance with its international obligations, Colombia establishes an annual limit for the production volume of cannabis plants and derivatives, which is monitored by the International Narcotics Control Board. Based on this limit, the Colombian government established a quota system, in order to control the amount of psychoactive cannabis production per license. This means that for the Psychoactive Cannabis License, licensees must first apply for a specific crop or manufacturing quota, before beginning production. Such restriction is not applicable to non-psychoactive cannabis production, and therefore not applicable to the Non-Psychoactive Cannabis License. 

Other Licenses and Registrations

Compliance and Registrations for our Skincare and Beauty Products

Mind Naturals manufactures products under strict international standards. Pursuant to Colombian law, Mind Naturals is permitted to manufacture, sell and export beauty and cosmetics products made from CBD and other natural ingredients.

All Mind Naturals products are registered with INVIMA, Colombia’s food and drug regulatory agency. Currently, Mind Naturals has licenses from INVIMA for its products. 

Operating License and Registrations for Dermo-Cosmetic Products

In 2012, Flora Lab 2 focused its efforts on the construction of its production facility and received an operating license from INVIMA in November 2012. This operating license allows Flora Lab 2 to produce cosmetic products. This license is still in force. In 2013, the manufacturing and commercialization of Flora Lab 2’s brand products and third-party products commenced. Each product requires an individual registration. Flora Lab 2 currently has over 80 registered products for Flora Growth and from third parties. Flora Lab 2 provides design, manufacture, bottling and packaging services of cosmetics, food supplements, and phytotherapeutics.

Licenses for our Pharmaceutical Products

Flora Lab 2’s portfolio of products includes over 80 registered products that positively position Flora and its brands with the Colombian consumer. The breakdown is as follows: food (2), cosmetics (59), phytotherapeutics (4), drugs (12) and supplements (8). 

The build out of Flora Lab 4 was completed in February 2023 and is scheduled for GMP inspection at the end of March 2023. Flora Lab 4 develops cannabinoid drug compounds and is completing a GMP certification for non-sterile compounded drugs (topical, oral, among others). Once GMP is complete, Flora Lab 4 would be one of the first laboratories in Colombia with a cannabis certification to prepare compounded drugs, allowing for the development and commercialization of cannabis medicines in different pharmaceutical forms, such as drops, ointments, capsules, and suppositories. With the buildout complete, Flora Lab 4 is already in development of these pharmaceutical forms and distribution would begin upon receiving GMP cannabis certification.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolio

We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection laws in Colombia, the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property and our brands. We have applied for, and we have received approvals from INVIMA and other regulatory agencies in Colombia, for our beauty and skincare, pharmaceutical, loungewear, and food and beverage products. See “—Regulation of our Industry.” As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 100 approvals and registrations for our various products and such registrations have expiration dates ranging through July 2031, most with options to renew upon expiration. We do not anticipate any difficulty renewing these registrations to the extent we choose to do so.
Regulation of Our Industry 

Regulatory Framework in the United States

Packaging, Labeling and Advertising

The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, HHS, the USDA and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various state, local and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation of our products, which could result in lost sales and increased costs to the Company. A regulatory agency may not accept the evidence of safety for any new ingredients that we may want to market, or may determine that a particular product or product ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk. Regulatory agencies may also determine that a particular statement of nutritional support on our products, or a statement that we want to use on our products, is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a food “health claim”, or that particular claims are not adequately supported by available scientific evidence. Any such regulatory determination could prevent us from marketing particular products or using certain statements on those products, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

Developments in the laws and regulations governing our products may result in a more stringent regulatory landscape, which could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products that we are unable to reformulate, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling requirements, additional scientific substantiation requirements, and other requirements or restrictions. Such developments could increase our costs significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Cannabis for Medical Purposes

The United States healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we will provide and bill for telehealth services, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities, and other aspects of our planned operations. Of particular importance are:

· | The federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, that generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration for referring an individual, in return for ordering, leasing, purchasing or recommending or arranging for, or to induce the referral of an individual or the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services covered, in whole or in part, by any federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
· | The criminal healthcare fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), and related rules which prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. 


15


· | The federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities that knowingly submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, including qui tam or whistleblower suits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Reassignment of payment rules which prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or Medicaid programs. 
· | Similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues. 
· | State laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions, or engaging in certain practices such as splitting fees with physicians. 
· | Laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices. 
· | Certain provisions of the Social Security Act that impose criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments. 
· | Federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered. 
· | Federal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to enroll and participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs. 

Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could impose liability on us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from business operations, and result in adverse publicity.

The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our planned telehealth services business.

Regulatory Framework in Colombia

Our cultivation operations are in Colombia and are carried out through Cosechemos. As a cultivator of non-psychoactive, psychoactive cannabis and manufacturer of cannabis derivatives, the Company is substantially dependent on the licenses for cultivation, production and other regulatory activities granted to Cosechemos.

Over the past 50 years, Colombia has developed comprehensive regulation that took a hardline approach to narcotics and trafficking in response to the growing influence of international treaties and the efforts of governments to coordinate their drug policies. In the mid-1990s, Colombia decriminalized the personal possession and consumption of cannabis under Constitutional Court Ruling C-221 of 1994. While this represented a shift in approach by Colombian lawmakers, a constitutional amendment through Legislative Act 02 of 2009 reversed the effects of Ruling C-221 of 1994 and reinstated the prohibition on personal possession and consumption of narcotic or psychotropic substances, even on a personal dose basis, unless supported by a medical prescription.

Despite the constitutional amendment in 2009, Colombian cannabis legislation trended towards a preventative and rehabilitative approach. The Constitutional Court of Colombia, through rulings SU-642 of 1998 and C-336 of 2008, among others, established that the right to the free development of personality, also known as the right to autonomy and personal identity, grants individuals the right to self-determination, the freedom and independence to govern his/her own existence and determine a lifestyle according to his/her own interests; provided, that the rights of others and the constitutional order are respected.

In January 2013, the Advisory Commission on Drug Policy (the “Drug Policy Commission”) was established to provide recommendations on how legislation should treat criminal networks and citizen drug users, as well as the quantities to be considered as suitable personal amounts. In July 2014, the Drug Policy Commission issued an initial report submitted to the Ministry of Justice and Law analyzing the conditions of drug use in Colombia and proposing guidelines to update the policy.

In May 2015, the Drug Policy Commission published its final report, which proposed a review of the drug policy in the country and made important recommendations, such as: (i) the creation of an agency for drug policy; (ii) measures to help reduce the risk to consumers; (iii) to rethink the fumigation involved with cultivation; (iv) regulation of medicinal cannabis; (v) alternative means of measuring the success of policies against drugs; (vi) modernize the National Statute on Drugs and Psychoactive Substances; and (vii) to lead the global drug policy debate.

As a result of the final report of the Drug Policy Commission, the Colombian President approved and sanctioned Law 1787 of 2016 to regulate the use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes. The law marked a new direction in the legislative approach to drugs. Law 1787 amended articles 375, 376 and 377 of the Colombian Criminal Code (the “Criminal Code”) to eliminate penalties against the medical and scientific use of cannabis used under a license granted by the competent authorities. This amendment was necessary because the Criminal Code expressly established financial penalties and prison sentences for those who cultivate, preserve or finance marijuana plantations, among other related activities.

The following table summarizes the regulations applicable to the cultivation, manufacture, import, export and use of cannabis in Colombia.

Licenses

The Ministries of Health, Justice and Agriculture issued Decree 613 of 2017 subsequently modified by Decree 811 of 2021, to define the licenses that can be granted with respect to permitted activities related to medical cannabis that include: (i) the production of seeds for sowing, (ii) production and transformation of grain, (iii) manufacture of cannabis derivatives, (iv) research, (v) export, (vi) industrial purposes, (vii) commercialization, among other activities, derived from the cultivation and manufacture of psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis plants according to each license.

Apart from a psychoactive cannabis license, Cosechemos has obtained licenses in each of the above categories, necessary to carry out its operations. Licenses are not transferable, interchangeable or assignable and are valid for five years and may be renewed for additional periods of ten (10) years upon request. Each of the licenses is up-to-date and has not expired. None of the Licenses are subject to current, pending or committed regulatory action.

Magistral Preparations

We intend to produce a category of products known as cannabis extemporaneous (magistral) preparation, previously regulated by Decree 613 of 2017 and now by Decree 811 of 2021 and Decree 2200 of 2005. Extemporaneous (magistral) preparations are personalized prescription products that do not require a sanitary license for the product but rather for the establishment that produces the product. As they are not mass-market products, but exclusively for a patient, these must be prepared by a licensee in an establishment that complies with the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices (BPE). For the sale and distribution of these medicines in Colombia, it is necessary to comply with the Guidelines for GMP certification for Extemporaneous (Magistral) Preparations with Cannabis issued on October 25, 2019 by INVIMA. We are required to operate, or have an agreement with, a laboratory that is certified according to GMP for extemporaneous (magistral) preparations with cannabis. Flora Lab #4 will be our production facility. Construction was completed in late February 2023. Inspection for the BPE/GMP is scheduled for March 27. 2023.

Strains registration

Cosechemos has varieties of cannabis in various stages of the registration process. Each strain, whether high or low in THC, must undergo an agronomic evaluation by the ICA. In order for strains to be included in the National Cultivar Registry, the following steps must be completed: (i) Genetic Stabilization; (ii) Agronomic Test; (iii) Phase 1 strain registry (legal document that allows the license to enter a strain in the registry); and (iv) Strain registration phase 2 (registration that allows the licensee to market any cannabis product derived from the specific strain in the registry). The harvest is also in the process of agronomic evaluation of additional strains. Based on the yields of each strain, as determined by agronomic testing, “COSECHEMOS YA” may decide to register fewer strains than available. The decision to complete the registration process of a strain will depend on several factors, from biomass yields, cannabinoid profile, average cannabinoid content, resistance to pests among others as determined by agronomic tests, and the intended uses by the company.

Cosmetic Regulations

The Company’s business also includes the manufacturing and marketing of cosmetics, including some with Cannabidiol (CBD) in Colombia. Cosmetic products in Colombia are regulated by regulations issued by the Andean Community of Nations.

The relevant regulations in health regulatory matters for Cosmetic Products are the following: Decision 833 of 2018 of the of the Andean Community of Nations upgrade sanitary regulation for the manufacture and commercialization of Cosmetic Products in the countries of the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru).

The relevant regulations in health regulatory matters for Cosmetic Products are the following:


· | Decision 833 of 2018 of the of the Andean Community of Nations upgrade sanitary regulation for the manufacture and commercialization of Cosmetic Products in the countries of the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Decision 516 of 2002 of the Andean Community of Nations establishes a sanitary regulation for the manufacture and commercialization of Cosmetic Products in the countries of the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru). Established for the labeling mandatory requirements.
· | Decree 219 of 1998, which regulates the quality and control of Cosmetic Products. 
· | Law 9 of 1979, which establishes the general framework for health surveillance and control. 

In Colombia, cosmetics must undergo a registration process called Mandatory Sanitary Notification (NSO), which is supervised by INVIMA, prior to marketing. Applicable regulations establish requirements related to labeling, manufacturing facilities, and product composition. The general Colombian regulatory framework on specific cannabis issues limits the manufacture of products with cannabis derivatives with a maximum of 1% THC (psychoactive component) but that the product must demonstrate and comply with the respective international regulations with contents below 0.3% or 0.2% THC.

Ingredients in the list of accepted ingredients of the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) in the United States, Cosmetic ingredient database CosIng in the European Commission database for information on cosmetic substances and Cosmetic products marketed in the Andean Subregion must comply with the international lists of ingredients below that may or may not be incorporated into cosmetic products and their corresponding functions and restrictions or conditions of use.

· | The Personal Care Products Council’s cosmetic ingredient listings; 
· | European Union Directives or Regulations governing cosmetic ingredients; and 
· | Cosmetic Ingredient Listings Europe – The Personal Care Association. As long as the governmental entities that are in charge of the regulation, surveillance and sanitary control of cosmetic products, according to the national legislation of each member country of the Andean Subregion, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru do not take a decision under Article 5 of Andean Decision 833 of 2018, member countries shall use the least restrictive list and the ingredients contained in the European cosmetic (CosIng) are permitted in cosmetic products, including the following cannabis ingredients: Cannabis sativa seed extract, Cannabis Sativa glycer glycertic seed oil-8, Sativa-8 cannabis seed esters, Cannabis Sativa Seedcake, Cannabis Sativa seed powder, Hydrolyzed Sativa cannabis seed extract, Hydrolyzed hemp seed, Cannabidiol - derived from extract or tincture or resin of cannabis, cannabidiol - synthetically produced, cannabidiol trisiloxane.

Regulatory Framework in Germany

The importation and distribution of medical cannabis in Germany is mainly covered by the German Narcotics Law (Betäubungsmittelgesetz or “BtMG”), the AMG, and the German Narcotics Foreign Trade Ordinance (Betäubungsmittel-Außenhandelsverordnung or “BtMAHV”) as well as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) (the “Single Convention”). The relevant competent authorities in Germany are the BfArM, the Federal Opium Authority (a sub-unit of the BfArM), and German Federal authorities.

Under Section 1(1) in conjunction with Annex I of BtMG, cannabis is a narcotic drug, subject to certain exceptions including seeds and cannabis from a certified source with a THC content of less than 0.2%, which are only used for scientific or commercial purposes and for which psychoactive abuse is excluded. It is a criminal offence in Germany to illicitly cultivate, produce and trade in cannabis or to import, export, transit, sell, supply, otherwise place it on the market or acquire or procure it in any other way, subject to the foregoing exemptions.


19


The Act on the Amendment of Narcotic Drugs and Other Regulations (Gesetz zur Änderung betäubungsmittelrechtlicher und anderer Vorschriften), which came into force on March 10, 2017, introduced an exception to allow the prescription and trade of cannabis for medical purposes. Prior to March 2017, the import of cannabis was not permitted, and pharmacies could request medical cannabis from abroad for specific patients only in exceptional circumstances (upon medical prescription), subject to a special case-by-case approval issued by BfArM. Since March 2017, cannabis cultivated for medical purposes outside Germany can be imported and marketed in Germany by private companies provided they have obtained the relevant licenses that must be in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. When the German federal government legalized cannabis for medical purposes in March 2017, they also established a cannabis agency as part of BfArM. This agency controls cultivation, harvesting, processing, quality inspection, storage, packaging and distribution to wholesaler and pharmacists or manufacturers.

EU-GMP Certification

The guidelines on EU GMP describe the minimum standard that a pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet in its production processes according to European standards. Any pharmaceutical manufacturer wishing to import medicinal products into the European Union must comply with EU GMP.

A prerequisite under EU GMP is that medicinal products must be of consistently high quality, suitable for their intended use and meet the requirements of the marketing authorization based on stability data. For this reason, an EU-GMP certification facilitates the movement of goods and contributes to the credibility of the product. In general, Article 51 of Commission Directive 2001/83/EC requires that each and every batch imported from an European Union country outside the European Union is checked to ensure that it complies with EU-GMP standards. If a manufacturer in a non-EU country has an EU-GMP certification for its medicinal product, this batch testing is not required pursuant to Article 51(2) of Commission Directive 2001/83/EC.

Under German law, the EU-GMP guidelines must be complied with respect to medicinal products and active substances that are manufactured, tested, stored, placed on the market in Germany, brought into or out of the German territory, imported or exported.
