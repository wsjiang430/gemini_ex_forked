ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Integer Holdings Corporation, headquartered in Plano, Texas, is among the world’s largest medical device outsource (“MDO”) manufacturing companies, serving the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular, advanced surgical and portable medical market. We provide innovative, high quality medical technologies that enhance the lives of patients worldwide. In addition, we develop batteries for high-end niche applications in energy, military, and environmental markets. Our brands include GreatbatchTM Medical, Lake Region MedicalTM and ElectrochemTM. Our primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their affiliated subsidiaries. When used in this report, the terms “Integer,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” mean Integer Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries.
We organize our business into two reportable segments, Medical and Non-Medical, and derive our revenues from four principal product lines. The Medical segment includes the Cardio & Vascular, Cardiac & Neuromodulation and Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical product lines and the Non-Medical segment is comprised of the Electrochem product line.
Our Acquisitions and Divestitures
On July 2, 2018, we completed the sale of the Advanced Surgical and Orthopedic product lines (the “AS&O Product Line”) to Viant. As a result, we classified the results of operations of the AS&O Product Line as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2017. All results and information presented exclude the AS&O Product Line unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 2 “Discontinued Operations and Divestiture” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about the divestiture.
On March 14, 2016, we completed the spin-off of a portion of our former QiG segment through a tax-free distribution of all of the shares of our former QiG Group, LLC subsidiary to Integer’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2016 (the “Spin-off”). Immediately prior to completion of the Spin-off, QiG Group, LLC was converted into a corporation incorporated under the laws of Delaware and changed its name to Nuvectra Corporation (“Nuvectra”). Each Integer stockholder received one share of Nuvectra common stock for every three shares of Integer common stock held as of the record date. As a result, Nuvectra became an independent, publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Integer retains no ownership interest in Nuvectra.
On October 27, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Lake Region Medical Holdings, Inc. (“LRM”), headquartered in Wilmington, MA, in a cash and stock transaction for a total purchase price including debt assumed of approximately $1.77 billion. LRM was primarily a manufacturer of interventional and diagnostic wire-formed medical devices and components specializing in minimally invasive devices for cardiovascular, endovascular, and neurovascular applications. The acquisition of LRM added scale and diversity to our legacy operations, which has enhanced our opportunities to access customers and customer experience by providing a more comprehensive portfolio of technologies.

Cardiac and neuromodulation products include batteries, capacitors, filtered and unfiltered feedthroughs, engineered components, implantable stimulation leads and enclosures used in implantable medical devices (“IMD”). Additionally, we offer value-added assembly for these IMDs. An IMD is an instrument that is surgically inserted into the body to provide diagnosis and/or therapy. One sector of the IMD market is cardiac, which is comprised of devices such as implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (“ICD”), cardiac resynchronization therapy (“CRT”) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy with backup defibrillation devices (“CRT-D”), insertable cardiac monitors (“ICM”), and ventricular assist devices. Another sector of the IMD market is neuromodulation, comprised of pacemaker-type devices that stimulate nerves for the treatment of various conditions. Beyond established therapies for pain control, incontinence, movement disorders (Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor and dystonia) and epilepsy, nerve stimulation for the treatment of other disabilities such as sleep apnea, heart failure, migraines, obesity and depression has shown promising results.
-  4 -

The following are the main categories of battery-powered IMDs and the principal illness or symptoms treated by each device:

Device | Principal Illness or Symptom 
Pacemakers | Abnormally slow heartbeat (Bradycardia) 
ICDs | Rapid and irregular heartbeat (Tachycardia) 
CRT/CRT-Ds | Congestive heart failure 
ICMs | Unexplained fainting or risk of cardiac arrhythmias 
Neurostimulators | Chronic pain, incontinence, movement disorders, epilepsy, obesity or depression
Cochlear hearing devices | Hearing loss 

IMD systems generally include an IPG and one or more stimulation leads. An IPG is a battery powered device that produces electrical pulses. A lead then carries this electrical pulse from the IPG to the heart, spinal cord or other location in the body. Our portfolio of proprietary technologies, products, and capabilities has been built to provide our cardiac and neuromodulation customers with a single source for the vast majority of the components and subassemblies required to manufacture an IPG or lead, including complete lead systems. Our investments in research and development have generated proprietary products such as the QHR®, QMR®, and QCAPSTM primary battery and capacitor lines, which have enabled our OEM partners to make improvements in their system offerings in terms of device reliability, size, longevity and power. Our XcellionTM line of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries leverages decades of implantable battery research, development and manufacturing expertise. This line of battery cells includes the optional CoreGuardTM feature, which enables batteries to discharge to zero volts without performance degradation.
The following are the principal products and services offered by our Cardiac & Neuromodulation product line:

Orthopedic. Our orthopedic products include hip and shoulder joint reconstruction implants, plates, screws and spinal devices, as well as instruments and delivery systems used in hip and knee replacement, trauma fixation, extremity and spine surgeries. Orthopedic implants are used in reconstructive surgeries to replace or repair hips, knees and other joints, such as shoulders, ankles and elbows that have deteriorated as a result of disease or injury. Trauma implant systems are used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone or tissue while the body heals. Spinal implant systems are used by orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and injuries in various regions of the spine.
Each implant system typically has an associated instrument set that is used specifically in the surgical implant procedure. Instruments included in a set vary by implant system. Orthopedic trays have generally been designed to allow for sterilization and re-use after an implant or other surgical procedure is performed. Recently, the industry trend is moving towards single use instrumentation. Cases are used to store, transport and arrange implant systems and other medical devices and related surgical instruments. The majority of cases are tailored for a specific implant procedure so that the instruments, implants, and other devices are arranged to match the order of use in the procedure and are securely held in clearly labeled, custom-formed pockets or brackets.

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS
Customers
Our products are designed to provide reliable, long-lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers. The nature and extent of our commercial relationships with each of our customers are different in terms of breadth of products purchased, purchased product volumes, length of contractual commitment, ordering patterns, inventory management, and selling prices. Contracts with customers can include tiered pricing arrangements based on pre-determined volume levels, in which higher volume levels typically have lower pricing, or fixed annual price downs that are offered to customers in exchange for increased volume levels and/or longer contract terms.  Typically, our contracts specify minimum order quantities and lead times. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized based upon the transaction price and when performance obligations are satisfied and the customer has obtained control of the products, which typically occurs when title and risk of loss ownership transfers to the customer, primarily determined by shipping terms. The transaction price is determined based on the unit price and the number of units ordered, less any rebates or other price concessions expected to be earned on those units, and is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.
-  6 -

Our visibility into customer forecasted purchases is only over a relatively short period of time into the future. Our customers may have inventory management programs, vertical integration plans and/or alternate supply arrangements that may not be communicated to or shared with us. Additionally, the relative market share among the OEM manufacturers changes periodically. Consequently, these and other factors can significantly impact our sales in any given period. Our customers may initiate field actions with respect to market-released products. These actions may include product recalls or communications with a significant number of physicians about a product or labeling issue. The scope of such actions can range from very minor issues affecting a small number of units to more significant actions. There are a number of factors, both short-term and long-term, related to these field actions that may impact our results. In the short-term, if a product has to be replaced, or customer inventory levels have to be restored, demand will increase. Also, changing customer order patterns due to market share shifts or accelerated device replacements may also have a positive or negative impact on our sales results in the near-term. These same factors may have longer-term implications as well. Customer inventory levels may ultimately have to be rebalanced to match new demand.
Our Medical customers include large multi-national medical device OEMs and their subsidiaries such as Abbott Laboratories, Biotronik, Boehringer Ingelheim, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Johnson & Johnson, LivaNova, Medtronic, Nevro Corp., Philips Healthcare, Smith & Nephew, Stryker, Viant and Zimmer Biomet. During 2018, sales to Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic and Boston Scientific were each in excess of 10% of total sales and collectively accounted for 52% of our total sales. We believe that the diversification of our sales among the various subsidiaries and market segments with those three customers reduces our exposure to negative developments with any one customer. The loss of a significant amount of business from any of these three customers or a further consolidation of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as further explained in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report.
Our Non-Medical customers include large multi-national OEMs and their subsidiaries serving the energy, military and environmental services markets such as Halliburton, Teledyne Technologies and Weatherford International.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products directly to our customers. In 2018, approximately 57% of our products were sold in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are primarily to customers whose corporate offices are located and headquartered in the U.S. Information regarding our sales by geographic area is set forth in Note 17 “Segment and Geographic Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Although the majority of our customers contract with us to develop custom components and assemblies to fit their product specifications, we also provide system and device solutions ready for market distribution by OEMs. We have established close working relationships between our internal program managers and our customers. We market our products and technologies at industry meetings and trade shows domestically and internationally. We have placed additional emphasis on reaching long-term agreements with our OEM customers in order to secure our revenue base.
Internal account executives support all sales activity and involve engineers and technology professionals in the sales process to address customer requests across all product lines. For system and device solutions, we partner with our customers’ research, marketing, and clinical groups to jointly develop technology platforms in alignment with their product roadmaps and therapy needs.
We leverage our account executives with support from our engineers to design and sell product solutions into our targeted markets. Our account executives are trained to assist our customers in selecting appropriate materials and configurations. We market our products and services through well-defined selling strategies and marketing campaigns that are customized for each of the industries we target.
Firm backlog orders at December 28, 2018 were approximately $268 million. The majority of the orders outstanding at December 28, 2018 are expected to be shipped within one year.
Competition
The MDO manufacturing industry has traditionally been highly fragmented with several thousand companies, many of which we believe have limited manufacturing capabilities and limited sales and marketing expertise. We believe that very few companies offer the scope of manufacturing capabilities and services that we provide to medical device companies, however, we may compete in the future against other companies that provide broad manufacturing capabilities and related services. We compete against different companies depending on the type of product or service offered or the geographic area served. We also face competition from existing and prospective customers that employ in-house capabilities to produce some of the products we provide. 
-  7 -

Our existing or potential competitors include suppliers with different subsets of our manufacturing capabilities, suppliers that concentrate in niche markets, and suppliers that have, are developing, or may in the future develop, broad manufacturing capabilities and related services. We compete for new business at all phases of the product life cycle, which includes development of new products, the redesign of existing products and transfer of mature product lines to outsourced manufacturers. Competitive advantage is generally based on reputation, quality, delivery, responsiveness, breadth of capabilities, including design and engineering support, price, customer relationships and increasingly the ability to provide complete supply chain solutions rather than only producing and providing individual components.
Many of our customers, if they choose to undertake vertical integration initiatives, also have the capability to manufacture similar products, in house, to those that we currently supply to them.
Acquisitions and Investments
One facet of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions that complement our core competencies in technology and manufacturing to enable us to manufacture and sell additional products to our existing customers and to expand our business into related markets.
The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop an all-encompassing portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research, development and engineering (“RD&E”) efforts, we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon acquisitions, investments, and alliances to provide access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas and markets. This strategy also aligns with our customers’ expectations of increasing the speed to market of critical solutions.
We expect to make future investments or acquisitions where we believe that we can stimulate the development of, or acquire, new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives, and strengthen our existing businesses. Our acquisition focus will be primarily directed at smaller “bolt-on” or adjacent acquisition opportunities that have a strategic fit with our existing core businesses, particularly opportunities that support our enterprise strategy and enhance the value proposition of our product offerings.
Research and Product Development
Our position as a leading developer and manufacturer of medical devices and components is largely the result of our long history of technological innovation. Our scientists, engineers and technicians focus on developing new products, improving and enhancing existing products, and expanding the use of our products in new or tangential applications. In addition to our internal technology and product development efforts, we also engage outside research institutions for unique technology projects.
Medical. We believe our core business is well positioned because our OEM customers leverage our portfolio of intellectual property. We continue to build a healthy pipeline of diverse medical technology opportunities and provide a new level of industry leading capabilities and services to our OEM customers across the full range of medical device products and services continuum. We are at the forefront of innovating technologies and products that help change the face of healthcare, enabling us to provide our customers with a distinct advantage as they bring complete medical systems and solutions to market. In turn, our customers are able to accelerate patient access to life enhancing therapies. We offer our customers a comprehensive portfolio comprising the best technologies, providing a single point of support, and driving optimal outcomes. Some of the more significant product development opportunities our Medical segment is pursuing are as follows:

Product Line | Product Development Opportunities 
Cardio & Vascular | Developing a portfolio of catheter, introducer, wire-based, sensor and coating products for the cardio and vascular markets. 
Cardiac & Neuromodulation | Developing next generation technology programs for our batteries, filtered feedthroughs, high voltage capacitors and lead solutions to reduce the size and cost, while increasing performance for cardiac and neuromodulation devices.

Non-Medical. Some of the more significant product development opportunities our Non-Medical segment is pursuing include developing the next generation medium-rate and high rate batteries, as well as products with extended performance such as higher power pulsing capabilities and increased operating temperature range.
-  8 -

Patents and Proprietary Technology
Our policy is to protect our intellectual property rights related to our technologies and products, and we rely on a combination of patents, licenses, trade secrets and know-how to establish and protect our rights. Where appropriate, we apply for U.S. and foreign patents. We also are a party to license agreements with third parties under which we have obtained, on varying terms, exclusive or non-exclusive rights to patents held by them. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole. As of December 28, 2018, we owned 695 U.S. and foreign patents and held licenses to an additional 270 U.S. and foreign patents.
Design, development and regulatory aspects of our business also provide competitive advantages, and we require our employees, consultants and other parties having access to our confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements prohibit disclosure of confidential information to third parties, except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all confidential information relating to our business is the exclusive property of Integer.
Manufacturing and Quality Control
We leverage our strength as an innovative designer and manufacturer of finished devices and components to the medical device industry. Our manufacturing and engineering services include: design, testing, component production, and device assembly. We have integrated our proprietary technologies in our own products and those of our customers. Our flexible, high productivity manufacturing capabilities span sites across the United States, Mexico, Uruguay, Europe, and Malaysia.
Due to the highly regulated nature of the products we produce, we have implemented strong quality systems across all sites. The quality systems at our sites are compliant with and certified to various recognized international standards, requirements, and directives. Each site’s quality system is certified under an applicable International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) quality system standard, such as ISO 13485 or ISO 9001. This certification requires, among other things, an implemented quality system that applies (where applicable) to the design and manufacture of components, assemblies and finished medical devices, including component quality and supplier control. Maintenance of these certifications for each facility requires periodic re-examination from an independent notified body.
Along with ISO 13485, the facilities producing finished medical devices are subject to oversight by Notified Bodies and extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other international regulatory agencies and, in order to assure the conformance of devices and components of a worldwide basis. For these facilities, we maintain FDA registration and compliance with all applicable domestic and international regulations. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA and other international regulatory bodies.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We purchase critical raw materials from a limited number of suppliers due to the technically challenging requirements of the supplied product and/or the lengthy process required to qualify these materials both internally and with our customers. We cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials because of these rigid requirements. For these critical raw materials, we maintain minimum safety stock levels and partner with suppliers through contract to help ensure the continuity of supply. Historically, we have not experienced any significant interruptions or delays in obtaining critical raw materials.
Many of the raw materials that are used in our products are subject to fluctuations in market price. In particular, the prices of stainless steel, titanium and precious metals, such as platinum, have historically fluctuated, and the prices that we pay for these materials, and, in some cases, their availability, are dependent upon general market conditions. In most cases, we have pass-through pricing arrangements with our customers that purchase components containing precious metals or have established firm-pricing agreements with our suppliers that are designed to minimize our exposure to market fluctuations.
For non-critical raw material purchases, we utilize competitive pricing methods such as bulk purchases, precious metal pool buys, blanket orders, and long-term contracts to secure supply. We believe that there are alternative suppliers or substitute products available at competitive prices for all of these non-critical raw materials. 
As discussed more fully in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report, our business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials from a limited number of suppliers. If an unforeseen interruption of supply were to occur, we may be unable to obtain substitute sources for these raw materials on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could harm our ability to manufacture our products profitably or on time. Additionally, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials as there are a limited number of worldwide suppliers.
-  9 -

Working Capital Practices
Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure that we have adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers. It will continue to be a priority for us to maintain appropriate working capital levels while improving our operating cash flow and pay down outstanding debt.
Government Regulation
Medical Device Regulation
The development, manufacture and sale of our products is subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and comparable foreign counterparts.  In the U.S., these regulations were enacted under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder. These regulatory requirements subject our products and our business to numerous risks that are specifically discussed within “Risks Related to Our Industries” under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report. A summary of critical aspects of our regulatory environment is included below.
The FDA’s Quality System Regulations set forth requirements for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for on-site inspection of our facilities and continuing review by the FDA. Authorization to commercially market our non-exempt products in the U.S. is granted by the FDA under procedures referred to as 510(k) pre-market notification or pre-market approval (“PMA”).  These processes require us to notify the FDA of the new product and obtain FDA clearance or approval before marketing the device. 
The FDA classifies medical devices based on the risks associated with the device. Devices are classified into one of three categories - Class I, Class II, or Class III. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are therefore subject to the least regulatory controls. Class II devices are higher risk devices than Class I and require greater regulatory controls, generally a 
510(k) pre-market notification, to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness as well as substantial equivalence to a previously cleared device, as demonstrated by data. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory control, requiring a PMA by the FDA before they are marketed.
We market our products in numerous foreign countries and therefore are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, sterilization, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import laws and onsite inspection by independent bodies with the authority to issue or not issue certifications we may require to be able to sell products in certain countries.  Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.  The member countries of the European Union (“EU”) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all member countries.  These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in the EU to maintain quality system certifications through EU recognized Notified Bodies.  These Notified Bodies authorize the use of the CE Mark, which allows for free movement of our products throughout the member countries.  Requirements pertaining to our products vary widely from country to country, ranging from simple product registrations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA.
In the U.S., our introducer, guidewire, and delivery catheter products are considered Class II devices and generally the 510(k) process applies. Orthopedic instruments are considered Class I exempt, while pacing leads are subject to the Class III PMA process. In Europe, these devices are considered either Class I, Class IIa, Class III, or AIMD, under European Medical Device Directives. These Directives require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain a CE Mark for those products, which indicate that the products meet minimum standards of performance, essential requirements, safety conformity assessment and quality.
We believe that the procedures we use for quality controls, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices conform to the requirements of all pertinent regulations.
-  10 -

Environmental Health and Safety Laws
We are subject to direct governmental regulation, including the laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission, discharge, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of these materials at our facilities and at off-site disposal locations. Our manufacturing and RD&E activities may involve the controlled use of small amounts of hazardous materials. Liabilities associated with hazardous material releases arise principally under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws that impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of contaminated facilities and parties that arrange for the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws currently applicable to our business and we are not subject to any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any of our facilities or any off-site location. We may, however, become subject to these environmental liabilities in the future as a result of our historic or current operations.
Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain
We are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning “conflict minerals” (generally tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) and similar rules are being implemented by the EU. Certain of these conflict minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. These rules require us to investigate the source of any conflict minerals necessary to the production or functionality of our products. If any such conflict minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries (the “DRC region”), we must undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC region. Since our supply chain is complex, our ongoing compliance with these rules could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products.
We are also subject to disclosure requirements regarding abusive labor practices in portions of our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act.
Other Laws and Regulations
Our sales and marketing practices are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to federal anti-kickback laws, and are also subject to similar state laws.
