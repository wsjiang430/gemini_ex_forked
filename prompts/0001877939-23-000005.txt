Item 1. Business
Overview
Castellum, Inc. is focused on acquiring and growing technology companies in the areas of cybersecurity, IT, electronic warfare, information warfare, and information operations with businesses in the defense, federal, civilian, and commercial markets. Services include intelligence analysis, software development, software engineering, program management, strategic and mission planning, information assurance, cybersecurity and policy support, and data analytics. These services are applicable to customers in the United States government (“USG”), financial services, healthcare, and other users of large data applications. They can be delivered to on-premises enclaves or customers who rely upon cloud-based infrastructures. The Company has worked with multiple business brokers and contacts within their business network to identify potential acquisitions. Due to our success in completing six acquisitions over the previous three years and given our executive officers’ and key managers’ networks of contacts in the IT, telecom, cybersecurity, and defense sectors, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to execute our business strategy given a pipeline of identified and acquisition targets. Because of our executive officers’ and key managers’ prior experience growing businesses organically, we believe that we are well positioned to grow our existing business via internal growth as well. The Company has developed a qualified business opportunity (the “Opportunity Pipeline”). Although there can be no assurance that the Opportunity Pipeline can be converted to revenues, the Company expects that the total value of the Opportunity Pipeline to be approximately $475 million. The Opportunity Pipeline represents the revenue opportunity for the Company from potential future contracts obtained through organic growth from qualified customers based on the expected base year contract value plus the value of all option periods.
Our primary customers are agencies and departments of the USG. Our expertise and technology support national security missions and government modernization for intelligence, defense, and federal civilian customers. The demand for our expertise and technology, in large measure, is created by the increasingly complex network, systems, and information environments in which governments and businesses operate, and by the need to stay current with emerging technology while increasing productivity, enhancing security, and ultimately, improving performance.
We provide expertise and technology to enterprise and mission customers in support of national security missions and government modernization/transformation. Due to the nature of the work being executed for the USG the budgets are expected to continue to grow in support of bipartisan national security imperatives. The majority of contracted work is operational in nature and is funded on an on-going basis.
As a government contractor, Castellum both cooperates (as a teaming partner) and competes with many different companies. Sometimes, Castellum both teams with (on one contract) and competes against (on a different contract) the same company. Among others, Castellum competes with (and sometimes also teams with) Northrup Grumman, CACI, Peraton, and Booz-Allen Hamilton
Our Markets
We provide our expertise and technology to our domestic and international customers in the following market areas:
•Digital Solutions – Castellum transforms how government does business. We modernize enterprise and agency-unique applications, enterprise infrastructure, and business processes to enhance productivity and increase user satisfaction. We use data analytics and visualization to provide insights and outcomes that optimize our customer’s operations.
•C4ISR, Cyber & Space – Castellum teams ensure information superiority by delivering multi-domain C4 technology and networks. Our software-defined, full-spectrum cyber, electronic warfare, and C-UAS solutions provide electromagnetic spectrum advantage and deliver precision effects against national security 
threats. We are at the forefront of developing technologies that meet the challenges of 5G wireless communications both on and off the battlefield, millimeter wave, and the use of lasers for free space optical communications and long-range sensing.
•Engineering Services – Castellum provides platform integration, modernization, and sustainment; system engineering; naval architecture; training and simulation services; and logistics engineering to help our customers achieve a decisive tactical edge. We enhance platforms to improve situational awareness, mobility, interoperability, lethality, and survivability. We conduct software vulnerability analysis and harden technology to protect against malicious actors. Our platform-agnostic, mission-first approach ensures optimal performance, so our nation’s forces can overmatch our adversaries.
•Enterprise IT – Castellum amplifies efficiency with unmatched expertise and next-generation technology. We design, implement, protect, and manage secure enterprise IT solutions for the United States (“U.S.”) federal, state, and local agencies to optimize efficiency, enhance performance, and ensure end-user satisfaction.
•Mission support –Castellum specializes in planning and intelligence support for information warfare and information operations (“IW/IO”). The Company develops IW/IO plans, exercises, doctrine, and training for the Military Services and the Combatant Commands in domestic and deployed overseas locations. Our intelligence support ensures continuous advances in collection, analysis, and dissemination to optimize decision-making. Castellum also has linguists and cultural advisors who provide clients with insights into the history, media consumption, and cultural nuances of target audiences to maximize the effectiveness of communications plans and ensure mission success.
Strengths and Strategy
Extensive Sector Knowledge and Advanced Technology. We primarily offer our expertise and technology to defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments. Our work for USG agencies may combine a wide range of skills drawn from our expertise and technology. For example, Castellum performs software development and virtualization of infrastructure services for the U.S. Navy. We maintain and monitor government owned data centers. We are subject matter experts in electronic and electromagnetic warfare. We perform advanced data analytics on litigation data in support of the Department of Justice. Lastly, through the Company’s IW/IO operations, Castellum provides key services to governments of other nations.
International Presence. We have previously supported international clients in Australia and other foreign countries and believe that future opportunities for providing our services internationally is growing given current record nominal levels of global spending on defense and the continued rising threat from cybersecurity breaches.
Deep-Seated Government Relationships. To effectively perform on our existing customer contracts and secure new customer contracts with the U.S. federal, state, and local governments, we must maintain expert knowledge of agency policies, operations, and challenges. We combine this comprehensive knowledge with expertise and technology for our enterprise and mission customers. Our capabilities provide us with opportunities either to compete directly for, or to support other bidders in competition for multi-million dollar and multi-year award contracts from the U.S. federal, state, and local governments.
Complementary Product and Service Offerings. We have strategic business relationships with several companies associated with the IT industry which have business objectives compatible with ours and offer complementary products and services. We intend to continue development of these kinds of relationships wherever they support our growth objectives. Some of these business relationships have ultimately led to Castellum acquiring the teaming partner firm.
Our marketing and new business development is conducted by many of our officers and managers including the CEO, COO, other executive officers, and other key managers. We employ business development, capture and proposal writer professionals who identify and qualify major contract opportunities, primarily in the USG market and submit bids for those opportunities.
Much of our business is won through submission of formal competitive bids. Government and commercial customers typically base their decisions regarding contract awards on their assessment of the quality of past performance, compliance with proposal requirements, price, and other factors. The terms, conditions, and form of government contract bids, however, are in most cases specified by the customer. In situations in which the customer-imposed contract type and/or terms appear to expose us to inappropriate risk or do not offer us a sufficient financial return, we may seek alternative arrangements or opt not to bid for the work. Essentially all contracts with the USG, and many contracts with other 
government entities, permit the government customer to terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government or for default by the contractor. None of Castellum’s subsidiaries have had contract work terminated for non-performance. Although we operate under the risk of such terminations with the potential to have a material impact on operations, they are not common. Additionally, as with other government contractors, our business is subject to government customer funding decisions and actions that are beyond our control.
Our contracts and subcontracts are composed of a wide range of contract types, including fixed firm price (“FFP”), cost plus fixed fee (“CPFF”), time and materials (“T&M”), labor hour, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) and government wide acquisition contracts (“GWACS”) such as U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”) schedule contracts, substantially all of which are annual contracts, with options to renew. Because most government contracts renew annually, the Company does not have a material number of multi-year contracts. Typically, the prime contract will dictate the terms of the subcontracts including, among other things, the workshare percentages, mechanics of payment terms, and the process for operational management. We generated $25,302,224 (60%), $15,381,979 (61%), and $10,419,729 (78%) of our total revenues from T&M contracts in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
In the year ending December 31, 2022, the top three revenue-producing contracts, some of which consist of multiple task orders, accounted for forty-six percent (46%) of our revenue, or $19,223,528. Each of those contracts are associated with the Company’s areas of core expertise, as follows: (i) an annual contract with NAVAIR that contains multiple renewal options is a CPFF contract that goes to the systems engineering and design/software engineering and development expertise where the Company has developed software that manages the aircraft launch and recovery operations on aircraft carriers, (ii) an annual contract with Perspecta with multiple renewal option periods is a T&M contract which supports the cyber and EW work done at the Army Staff Level, and (iii) an annual contract with CACI that contains multiple renewal options is a T&M contract that leverages expertise in EW and is associated with developing a 5G spectrum management strategy and policy.
Some of our key initiatives include the following:
•Continue our unwavering commitment to our customers while supporting the communities in which we work and live;
•Continue to grow organic revenue across our large, addressable market;
•Recruit and hire a world class workforce to execute on our growing backlog; and
•Differentiate ourselves through our investment, including our strategic mergers and acquisitions allowing us to enhance our current capabilities and create new customer access points.
Acquisition Strategy
Castellum seeks acquisitions which fit one or more of the following criteria: (1) expands Castellum's capability in existing areas of expertise such as cybersecurity and electronic warfare; (2) broadens the scope of clients which Castellum serves such as adding a new service branch or new government agency; (3) increases the scale of Castellum's business in existing areas in order to generate better operating profit margins and reduce the Company's wrap rate; (4) increases the geographic footprint of Castellum in order to offer more capability to existing or new clients; (5) adds management talent to Castellum; (6) adds technological capability in new areas which Castellum believes are high growth potential; and (7) fills a need within Castellum to be able to serve current customers such as adding a prime contract vehicle or the capability to win new prime contract vehicles. In all cases, Castellum seeks acquisitions which are immediately accretive on a revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization), and net income per share basis as well as positive from a net present value perspective and which fit the culture of Castellum.
Customers
We provide expertise and technology to defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments. Our clients call us to work on their hardest problems by providing innovative, intelligent, and agile cloud-ready capabilities across the DoD Information Network Operations, Electromagnetic Warfare, Cyberspace Operations, Intelligence, and Information Dominance community. We specialize in intelligence analysis, software development, software engineering, turnkey system development, program management, strategic and mission planning, information assurance and cybersecurity and policy along with analysis support. 
Our government clients include cabinet-level departments of the USG, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corp, Special Operations, as well as other federal and civilian agencies. We also serve state and local agencies and commercial clients, working to solve their hardest and most sophisticated cyber challenges, and have one international client.
Contract Backlog
We define backlog to include the following three components:
•Funded Backlog. Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.
•Unfunded Backlog. Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders (including optional orders) for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized.
•Priced Options. Priced contract options represent 100% of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients’ option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized.
Our backlog does not include contracts that have been awarded but are currently under protest and also does not include any task orders under IDIQ contracts, except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts.
We cannot predict with any certainty the portion of our backlog that we expect to recognize as revenue in any future period and we cannot guarantee that we will recognize any revenue from our backlog. The primary risks that could affect our ability to recognize such revenue on a timely basis or at all are: program schedule changes, contract modifications, and our ability to assimilate and deploy new consulting staff against funded backlog; cost-cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce USG spending, which could reduce or delay funding for orders for services; and delayed funding of our contracts due to delays in the completion of the USG's budgeting process and the use of a Continuing Resolution (“CR”) by the USG to fund its operations. The amount of our funded backlog is also subject to change, due to, among other factors: changes in congressional appropriations that reflect changes in USG policies or priorities resulting from various military, political, economic, or international developments; changes in the use of USG contracting vehicles, and the provisions therein used to procure our services and adjustments to the scope of services, or cancellation of contracts, by the USG at any time. In our recent experience, none of the following additional risks have had a material negative effect on our ability to realize revenue from our funded backlog: the unilateral right of the USG to cancel multi-year contracts and related orders or to terminate existing contracts for convenience or default; in the case of unfunded backlog, the potential that funding will not be made available; and, in the case of priced options, the risk that our clients will not exercise their options.
In addition, contract backlog excludes orders under contracts for which the period of performance has expired, and we may not recognize revenue on the funded backlog that includes such orders due to, among other reasons, the tardy submission of invoices by our subcontractors and the expiration of the relevant appropriated funding in accordance with a predetermined expiration date such as the end of the USG's fiscal year.
We expect to recognize revenue from a substantial portion of funded backlog within the next 24 months. However, given the uncertainties discussed above, as well as the risks described in Budget Environment, we can give no assurance that we will be able to convert our backlog into revenue in any particular period, if at all.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that includes many firms, some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than we have. We know of no single competitor that is dominant in our fields of technology. We have a relatively small share of the addressable market for our solutions and services and intend to achieve growth and increase market share both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
Research and Development
The Company from time to time engages in research and development relative to its service offerings; however, the amounts expended for such efforts are not material to the Company’s financial statements.
Intellectual Property
The Company currently has no patents or trademarks that it believes to be material to the business. The Company does have significant intellectual property in the form of our highly educated and trained workforce which provides us with technical expertise and an enhanced ability to win ‘re-compete” business.
Regulation
As a contractor to the USG, as well as state and local governments, we are heavily regulated in most fields in which we operate. We deal with numerous USG agencies and entities, and when working with these and other entities, we must comply with and are affected by unique laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. Some significant law and regulations that affect us include the following:
•the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and agency regulations supplemental to FAR, which regulate the formation, administration, and performance of USG contract;
•the False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for violations, including substantial monetary penalties for, among other things, presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or approval;
•the False Statements Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the USG;
•the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Statute (formerly known as the “Truth in Negotiations Act”), which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of certain contracts, modifications, or task orders;
•the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and certain internal government procurement sensitive information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government procurement officials;
•laws and regulations restricting the ability of a contractor to provide gifts or gratuities to employees of the USG;
•post-government employment laws and regulations, which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit and hire current employees of the USG and deploy former employees of the USG;
•laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the handling, use, and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes or determined to be “controlled unclassified information” or “for official use only,” and the export of certain products, services, and technical data, including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work;
•laws, regulations, and executive orders regulating the handling, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information in the course of performing a USG contract;
•international trade compliance laws, regulations, and executive orders that prohibit business with certain sanctioned entities and require authorization for certain exports or imports in order to protect national security and global stability;
•laws, regulations, and executive orders governing organizational conflicts of interest that may restrict our ability to compete for certain USG contracts because of the work that we currently perform for the USG or may require that we take measures such as firewalling off certain employees or restricting their future work activities due to the current work that they perform under a USG contract;
•laws, regulations, and executive orders that impose requirements on us to ensure compliance with requirements and protect the government from risks related to our supply chain most notably is compliance with Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”);
•laws, regulations, and mandatory contract provisions providing protections to employees or subcontractors seeking to report alleged fraud, waste, and abuse related to a government contract;
•the National Industrial Security Operating Manual and other laws and regulations concerning the maintenance of a facility security clearance and the safeguarding of classified materials;
•the Contractor Business Systems rule, with authorizes Department of Defense agencies to withhold a portion of our payments if we are determined to have a significant deficiency in our accounting, cost estimating, purchasing, earned value management, material management and accounting, and/or property management system; and
•the Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting and allowability requirement that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based USG contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time.
Given the magnitude of our revenue derived from contracts with the DoD, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) is our relevant government audit agency. The DCAA audits the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies including, among other areas, compensation. The Defense Contract Management Agency (“DCMA”) as our relevant government contract management agency, may determine that a portion of our employee compensation is unallowable based on the findings and recommendations in the DCAA’s audits. In addition, the DCMA directly reviews the adequacy of certain other business systems, such as our purchasing system. We are also subject to audit by Inspectors General of other USG agencies.
The USG may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. Internationally, we are subject to special USG laws and regulations (such as The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), local government regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings, as well as varying currency, political and economic risks. To mitigate the risk of CMMC compliance the Company has employed a senior executive whose full-time responsibility is compliance. Regarding CMMC compliance, this individual is considered a certified assessor and is preparing the Company for CMMC certification.
USG contracts are, by the terms, subject to termination by the USG either for convenience or default by the contractor. In addition, USG contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract performance could take many years. As is common in the industry, our Company is subject to business risk, including changes in governmental appropriations, national defense polices, service modernizations plans, and availability of funds. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our Company's business with the USG in the future.
The USG has a broad range of actions it can instigate to enforce its procurement law and policies. These include proposing a contractor, certain of its operations or individual employees for debarment or suspending or debarring a contractor, certain of its operations or individual employees from future government business. In addition to criminal, civil, and administrative actions by the USG, under the False Claims act, an individual alleging fraud related to payments under a USG contract or program may file a qui tam lawsuit on behalf of the government against us; if successful in obtaining a judgment or settlement, the individual filing the suit may receive up to thirty percent (30%) of the amount recovered by the government.
See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors: We generate substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the U.S. federal, state and local governments which are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are our most valuable resource. We are in continuing competition for highly skilled professionals in virtually all of our market areas. The success and growth of our business are significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain high quality people at all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 207 full and part-time employees with forty-nine percent (49%) of our employees holding degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics fields, twenty-eight percent (28%) holding advanced degrees, and eighty-four percent (84%) of our employees holding security clearances. We also retain 11 independent contractors. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good. All employees are subject to contractual agreements that specify requirements on confidentiality and restrictions on working for competitors, as well as other standard matters. 
Benefits are viewed as a critical tool for employee recruitment and retention. To that end, Castellum has migrated over half of its employees from their legacy benefits programs to the ADP Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”), with the balance of its employees targeted to be migrated in 2023. The implementation of the ADP PEO has allowed for the 
extension of benefits not previously offered to include a broad suite of additional services at reduced cost to the employees (such as financial planning, legal services, additional life insurance, and long-term care).
