Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical stage biotherapeutics company focusing on advancing technologies to enable the administration of biologics and drugs orally, to provide patients, physicians, and healthcare systems with a convenient alternative to painful injections. We are advancing a portfolio of oral therapeutics using our proprietary delivery technology.
We are developing and clinically testing a drug-agnostic oral delivery platform, the RaniPill capsule, which is designed to deliver a wide variety of drug substances, including large molecules such as peptides, proteins, and antibodies. The current RaniPill capsule, the RaniPill GO, is designed to deliver up to a 3 mg dose of drug with high bioavailability. We are also developing a high-capacity version known as the RaniPill HC, which is in preclinical stage and which is intended to enable delivery of drug payloads up to 20 mg with high bioavailability. The RaniPill GO is optimized to orally deliver a variety of therapeutics, and we are advancing development of the RaniPill HC to address biologics and drugs with higher dosing requirements. We believe that, together, the RaniPill GO and RaniPill HC could enable us to deliver most biologics currently on the market via a convenient, oral daily dose.
Data Overview
 We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials with the RaniPill capsule technology. In 2022, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with RT-102, a RaniPill GO capsule containing our proprietary formulation of parathyroid hormone (1-34) (“PTH”), in Australia. The study involved a single-ascending dose portion and a seven-day repeat-dose portion. The Phase 1 study met all of its endpoints, RT-102 was well tolerated and delivered PTH with high bioavailability (more than 300% greater bioavailability than subcutaneous injection of Forteo (teriparatide)). No serious adverse events were reported in the study. In 2019, we completed a Phase 1 study with RT-101, a RaniPill GO capsule containing our proprietary formulation of octreotide, in Australia. The Phase 1 study met all of its endpoints, RT-101 was well tolerated and delivered octreotide with high bioavailability (comparable to subcutaneous injection of octreotide). No serious adverse events were reported in the study.
As of December 31, 2022, we have administered the RaniPill capsule 185 times to 98 human subjects in clinical trials, including seven-day repeat-dosing in ten subjects in our Phase 1 study of RT-102. This is in addition to oral administrations of the RaniPill capsule, without a drug or needle, in non-significant risk studies. In our clinical studies, our product candidates were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events were observed.
 Preclinically, we have tested 12 molecules in the RaniPill capsule, including five antibodies, six peptides and one large protein. We have conducted preclinical testing of more than 1,700 RaniPill capsules in vitro and more than 1,300 RaniPill capsules in vivo, including two good laboratory practice (“GLP”) seven-day repeat-dose studies which supported advancement of our product candidates, RT-101 and RT-102, into clinical studies.
 Pipeline Overview
 The broad utility of the RaniPill capsule to enable the oral delivery of biologics provides us with a range of attractive development opportunities. We have prioritized development based on specific scientific, developmental, regulatory, and commercial considerations to optimize our portfolio of targeted product candidates. Our internal development targets are focused on well-characterized molecules with attractive commercial characteristics. We believe selection of these targets will allow us to potentially accelerate product approval and market launch, while also broadening patient, provider, and payor acceptance of the RaniPill capsule.

Below is a summary of our product candidate pipeline. We envision complementing these programs with robust partnering activities to maximize the value inherent in the RaniPill capsule.

Clinical Update
 RT-102
 In August 2022, we announced positive topline results from Part 1 (“Study Part 1”) of the Phase 1 study of RT-102, which is being developed for the potential treatment of osteoporosis. The study met all of its endpoints and RT-102 was generally well tolerated. In the study, RT-102 orally delivered 20 µg and 80 µg of PTH with 300-400% greater bioavailability than subcutaneous Forteo (teriparatide) 20 µg.
In December 2022, we announced positive topline results from Part 2 (“Study Part 2”) of the Phase 1 study of RT-102. The study met all of its endpoints. The study evaluated the safety and tolerability of once-daily administration of RT-102 containing 20 µg of PTH given repeatedly for seven consecutive days in ten healthy female volunteers. RT-102 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events noted, and delivered 20 µg of PTH with high bioavailability, confirming the high bioavailability observed in Study Part 1.
 Study Part 1 - Topline Results
Study Design
The single-center, open label, Study Part 1 was conducted in Australia. The study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (“PK”) of RT-102 in healthy adult female volunteers. Of the 39 participants, 15 were administered RT-102 containing a single 20 μg dose of PTH and 14 were administered RT-102 containing a single 80 μg dose of PTH, while a control group of ten participants received a single 20 μg subcutaneous injection (SC) of Forteo (teriparatide), a commercial formulation of PTH for subcutaneous (“SC”) administration. The endpoints of the study were safety and tolerability, and measurements of serum concentrations of RT-102 in healthy adult female volunteers.
Safety Data
 •In Study Part 1, RT-102 was generally well tolerated, with no RaniPill-related adverse events (“AEs”) observed in study participants: 
 o0% (0/15) of participants dosed with RT-102 20 μg experienced drug-related AEs. 


o14% (2/14) of participants dosed with of RT-102 80 μg experienced drug-related AEs. 
 o50% (5/10) of participants dosed with 20 μg of Forteo SC experienced drug-related AEs. 
 oThere were no serious adverse events (“SAEs”) noted during Study Part 1. 
 Per protocol, in instances where the RaniPill capsule did not exit the stomach within seven hours, participants were excluded from the study. Based on the exclusion criteria, three participants were excluded from Study Part 1, one of whom experienced bloating, and one additional subject was excluded due to vomiting the capsule intact. In all instances, the capsule remnants passed from all participants who ingested the RaniPill capsule.
Pharmacokinetics
 •In Study Part 1, RT-102 (20 μg and 80 μg) orally delivered PTH with 300%-400% greater bioavailability than PTH delivered by Forteo SC (20 μg). 
 •RT-102 20 μg delivered PTH with lower, more sustained peak serum levels and higher area under the curve (“AUC”) than Forteo SC 20 μg. 
 

 | Forteo SC 20 μg | RT-102 20 μg | RT-102 80 μg
Cmax (pg/mL) | 128 ± 20 | 98 ± 10 | 971 ± 223 
Tmax (hr) | 0.217 | 1.13 | 0.994 
AUC (h*pg/mL) | 126 ± 64 | 342 ± 36 | 2600 ± 649 
Relative BA (5) | N/A | ~300% | ~400% 

Device Performance
 •Two versions of the RaniPill capsule were used during Study Part 1: Version C, which was used in Rani’s prior Phase 1 study of octreotide (which also utilized a Version A and Version B); and Version D, the latest iteration of the RaniPill capsule. 
 •RaniPill Version D demonstrated a higher drug delivery success rate than Version C: 
 •95% (20/21) of participants received successful drug delivery when ingesting RaniPill Version D. 
 •75% (6/8) of participants received successful drug delivery when ingesting RaniPill Version C. 
 The device performance analysis does not include participants excluded from the study per protocol, as drug delivery was not measured in such participants.
 Study Part 2 - Topline Results
 Study Design
Study Part 2 was a continuation of Rani’s single-center, open-label Phase 1 study of RT-102 conducted in Australia. The study evaluated the safety and tolerability of once-daily administration of RT-102 containing 20 μg of PTH given repeatedly for seven consecutive days in ten healthy female volunteers (five of whom were post-menopausal). Complete pharmacokinetic profiles of PTH were obtained for each subject on Day 7.
Safety Data
 •RT-102 was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events noted during the study 
 oNone of the participants withdrew from the repeat-dose study due to any adverse event related to the RaniPill capsule or due to difficulty swallowing the capsule
 oTwo subjects had transient, mild-to-moderate adverse events which resolved without any intervention 
 •Device remnants were excreted without sequelae in all subjects 


Pharmacokinetics
 •RT-102 delivered 20 µg of PTH with high bioavailability (relative to 20 µg SC Forteo (teriparatide) in Study Part 1), confirming the high bioavailability of PTH delivered via the RaniPill capsule observed during Study Part 1. 
Device Performance
 •In all ten participants who completed seven days of daily, consecutive dosing, the RaniPill capsule demonstrated an overall drug delivery success rate of 91% over the seven days (drug sampling was done at three, six and nine hours after capsule swallowing on Days 1-6). 
 •On Day 7, with more frequent, serial drug sampling after capsule swallowing on that day, the drug delivery success rate was 100%. 
 •On Days 1 through 6, participants ate food three hours after administration of the RaniPill capsule. The number of successful deployments was comparable before and after food was consumed. 
 Regulatory
 In January 2023, Rani announced that it completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA with respect to RT-102. Following feedback from the meeting, Rani believes that a 505(b)(2) pathway is suitable for the development of RT-102 in the U.S. In addition, Rani obtained guidance from the FDA on its preclinical and clinical development plans for RT-102, including the Phase 2 clinical trial which is expected to initiate in the second half of 2023.
Pharmacodynamics - Rodent Study
 We also conducted a 6-week pharmacodynamic (“PD”) study of the RT-102 drug substance (“DS”) PTH (1-34) to evaluate the effect of daily RT-102 DS intraperitoneal (“IP”) injections on bone mineral density (“BMD”) in a rodent model of osteoporosis. The study compared two control groups of rodents undergoing sham surgery (N=10) and ovariectomy (“OVX”) (N=10) receiving no drug, to three OVX groups each dosed with 5 mcg/kg per day of either RT-102 DS (N=10), teriparatide (N=10), or abaloparatide (N=10).
The study found that, following six weeks of treatment:
•RT-102 DS increased BMD in a rat model of osteoporosis. 
 •RT-102 DS delivered via the IP route of administration was biologically active comparable to SC injected PTH analogs. 
 RT-111
 In October 2022, we announced that we had begun preclinical development with RT-111, the RaniPill capsule containing an ustekinumab biosimilar.
In January 2023, we announced entering into a License and Supply Agreement with Celltrion, Inc. (“Celltrion”) under which we receive a license and supply of Celltrion’s ustekinumab biosimilar for development and commercialization of RT-111 worldwide, subject to a right of first negotiation for Celltrion following completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial that meets its primary endpoint(s) (the “Celltrion Agreement”).
RaniPill HC
 We continue to develop the RaniPill HC, a high-capacity RaniPill capsule designed to deliver drug payloads up to 20 mg, 500%-plus higher than the payload capacity of the RaniPill GO. We are conducting preclinical studies with a fully-autonomous RaniPill HC.


RT-109
 Following a strategic priority review in 2022, we decided not to continue active development of RT-109, a RaniPill capsule containing human growth hormone. We remain open to partnering opportunities with respect to RT-109, but intend to focus internal efforts on our other pipeline programs.
 The Market and Our Strategy
More than half of the adult population of the U.S. has one or more chronic diseases. The affected population is expected to continue to grow as the population ages. Chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases are increasingly being treated with biologics. In 2021, six of the ten highest revenue-producing drugs in the world were biologics. Current treatments using biologics are primarily via injections.
Biologics, the fastest growing segment of the drug industry, refers to a broad class of drugs that are derived from living sources. Biologics are distinguished from small molecules, like aspirin, which derive from chemistry. Biologics include, for example, recombinant therapeutic proteins, peptides, and monoclonal antibodies, as well as cell and gene therapies. In 2020, worldwide sales of biologics were estimated to have reached approximately $253.4 billion and are projected to reach $420.6 billion by 2025.
Biologics must generally be administered through intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Patient aversion to injections has promoted a significant interest in the development of solutions to enable the oral delivery of biologics. However, a significant hurdle is the ability to achieve sufficient bioavailability with oral biologics to produce an intended therapeutic effect. Bioavailability refers to the proportion of a delivered dose that reaches the bloodstream in active form. Attempts at oral delivery of biotherapeutics have remained largely unsuccessful due to the rapid degradation and digestion of biologics in the gastrointestinal (“GI”) environment before they can be absorbed into the bloodstream.
Our solution is a novel, proprietary and patented platform technology referred to as the RaniPill capsule, an orally ingestible pill designed to automatically deploy in the small intestine to administer a precise therapeutic dose of a biologic into the intestinal wall. Our several preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated bioavailability of biologics dosed via the RaniPill capsule that is generally comparable to the bioavailability of biologics dosed subcutaneously, with high dosing accuracy: this level of bioavailability is significantly higher than any that has been demonstrated with respect to others’ attempts at oral delivery of biologics.
We are pursuing a number of clinical and preclinical pipeline programs utilizing our RaniPill capsule. In addition, our newly designed high-capacity oral biologic delivery device, the RaniPill HC, has the potential to deliver 500%-plus higher payloads than our current RaniPill GO capsule. We believe this is a significant breakthrough in drug delivery with the potential to provide expansive opportunities for the company, such that we could potentially pursue a daily dosing option for over 50 additional biologics, for internal development or through partnership, including such biologics as pembrolizumab, etanercept, trastuzumab and secukinumab. We believe that oral biologics utilizing our RaniPill technology have the potential to disrupt the large and growing biologics market.
Our strategic vision is to disrupt and expand the market currently served by injectable only therapeutic biologics. We plan to do this by developing and advancing oral biologics therapies, directly ourselves and through partnering. We believe that the RaniPill capsule has the potential to improve the lives of millions of patients with chronic diseases who currently depend on biologics and drugs available only as injections.
 Our strategy includes the following aspects.
 •Pursue validated and commercially established market opportunities. We intend to pursue high-value markets with biologics that are already approved where we can develop our own differentiated products. We believe that these products will take market share from available therapies, while also expanding existing markets by reaching new patient populations that otherwise are not being treated by injectable biologics.
 •Expand in-house manufacturing of the RaniPill capsule. We have vertically integrated our manufacturing, and plan to continue to scale and optimize our manufacturing processes by expanding our use of automation.
 •Invest in RaniPill capsule capabilities. We intend to become a leader in oral biologics by continuing to invest in our technology, such as by expanding payload capacity and developing novel biologic formulations to maximize the number of therapeutic targets and addressable markets. 


•Expand our reach by selectively entering into strategic partnerships. We are opportunistically exploring strategic partnerships to enable us to expand our commercial reach and enable oral administration of a broader array of biologics.
 •Continue to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. Our patent portfolio has helped establish us as a leading oral biologics company. We plan to continue to innovate and expand our intellectual property by developing novel formulations and new applications of the RaniPill capsule.
 Rani LLC was founded by Mir Imran, our Chairman of the Board, who continues to contribute to our strategic planning and product development. Mir Imran has a background in medicine and engineering, is a prolific inventor and a serial entrepreneur, having founded more than 20 life sciences companies.
 Our Platform Technology
 Each of our product candidates is a RaniPill capsule containing a biologic. We may use the term RaniPill platform herein to refer to the physical structure and/or mechanisms of the RaniPill capsule absent a biologic.
Our clinically tested RaniPill delivery platform described below is intended to be capable of delivering up to a 3 mg dose of any drug. We are also developing a high-capacity version known as the RaniPill HC, and which is intended to enable delivery of drug payloads up to 20 mg and is in preclinical testing stage.
 The RaniPill capsule
 The RaniPill capsule is a versatile, drug-agnostic, orally ingestible pill approximately the size of a fish oil or calcium pill or a ‘000’-sized capsule.


RaniPill capsule in purple next to fish oil pills (gold) and calcium pills (white).
 
The capsule includes a proprietary coating designed to withstand stomach acid but dissolve in the jejunum portion of the small intestine. Dissolution of the coating leads to a series of steps that result in a biologic being delivered into the highly vascularized wall of the small intestine so that the biologic can be absorbed into the vasculature and enter the bloodstream.


The following illustrations depict the clinically tested RaniPill GO capsule traversing through and deploying within a lumen of the intestine illustrated in cross section.
 

Panel A | Panel B | Panel C | Panel D

 
Panel A: As the RaniPill capsule exits the stomach and enters the small intestine, the higher pH environment of around 6.5 in the jejunum begins to dissolve the coating.
Panel B: Dissolution of the coating exposes a balloon in the RaniPill capsule to intestinal fluid which results in the balloon self-inflating.
Panel C: Inflation of the balloon orients a microneedle contained within the balloon approximately perpendicular to the intestinal wall. The pressure in the balloon delivers the microneedle, which is smaller than a grain of rice, into the intestinal wall. The microneedle dissolves in the moist tissue environment, and the drug is absorbed into the vasculature and thereby into the bloodstream.
 Panel D: The balloon immediately deflates upon microneedle delivery and is excreted through normal digestive processes.
Features and advantages of the RaniPill capsule
The RaniPill capsule is a result of years of internal research activities to develop and optimize specialized components and systems that make up the RaniPill capsule. Several advanced features are included in the RaniPill capsule, providing what we believe to be significant and sustainable competitive advantages in the field of oral delivery of biologics. Some of the features and advantages of the RaniPill capsule are listed below.
 •High bioavailability and high dosing accuracy – Our studies conducted to date have demonstrated that the RaniPill capsule delivers biologics with bioavailability that is generally comparable to subcutaneous injection, with high dosing accuracy. This level of bioavailability is similar to subcutaneous injection and is significantly higher than that of currently marketed chemistry-based oral biologics, the best attempts of which to our awareness have resulted in peptides being delivered with only low single-digit bioavailability. 
 •Protective coating avoids deployment in the stomach – The proprietary protective coating formulation is pH-sensitive, enabling the RaniPill capsule to maintain its integrity through the acidic environment in the stomach for deployment in the small intestine.
 •Protection of the drug prior to delivery – The microneedle is protected from intestinal fluid until delivery, and then the rapid injection of the microneedle into the intestinal wall during delivery provides for little or no exposure of the microneedle to intestinal fluid. This technique serves to overcome the body’s natural mechanisms that break biologics down in the harsh GI environment and thus block biologics from reaching the blood stream from within the intestine.
 •Proprietary microneedle design preserves drug integrity and sterility – The proprietary dissolvable microneedle is made from injectable-grade, sterile materials. The microneedle is designed to accommodate in its hollow interior a biologic formed into a microtablet of up to 3 mg. Once exposed to body fluids, the microneedle begins to dissolve and expose the biologic for absorption into the vasculature. The sealed microneedle preserves the integrity and sterility of the biologic until the microneedle dissolves.
 •Delivery of the microneedle in both fed and fasted states – The RaniPill capsule is designed to deliver the microneedle even if the patient ingests the RaniPill capsule with or without food, which we expect will allow for more flexible dosing regimens and improved patient adherence to a given regimen. 


•Self-inflating balloon ensures reliable delivery – The proprietary self-inflating balloon is designed to provide optimal pressure to deliver the microneedle. In addition, the novel design of the balloon positions the microneedle approximately perpendicular to the intestinal wall for reliable drug delivery, with greater than 90% drug delivery success observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-102. The self-inflating balloon has been designed to minimize GI discomfort. 
 •Drug-agnostic design provides a standardized platform – The RaniPill capsule is designed to deliver any molecule irrespective of its molecular mass. This allows a single platform design to be used with multiple drugs.
 •Optimized dosing regimen – Based on the confirmed patient preference for oral delivery alternatives, we expect better treatment adherence with oral dosing versus injections, thus enabling a more physician-selectable dosing regimen. For example, the RaniPill capsule may enable a regimen of small daily doses, versus larger less-frequent doses for injections, to improve treatment adherence. In addition, small daily dosing may allow for therapeutic exposures to be maintained within a narrow range, whereas larger less frequent injection dosing can lead to large variations in therapeutic exposure, which can directly contribute to adverse events, loss of efficacy, and increased propensity for immunogenic response.
 Platform study in humans confirming reliable deployment in fed and fasted states
An initial clinical assessment of the RaniPill capsule (without a drug) was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the platform and to compare device performance in fed and fasted states in twenty healthy volunteers, divided into two groups of ten. In one group, the RaniPill capsule was administered under fasting conditions, while the other group was given the RaniPill capsule 45 minutes after consumption of a standardized meal. X-ray imaging was used to monitor transit of the device as well as its deployment. The evaluation involved the use of capsules that were not equipped with a drug or needle. The goals of this study were tolerability and effects of food on the RaniPill capsule’s functionality, as measured by the time required for the RaniPill capsule to reach and deploy in the small intestine.
The total transit time for the RaniPill capsule was longer in the fed group than in the fasted group because the capsule remained in the stomach longer in the fed group. However, food did not impact the deployment time of the RaniPill capsule. This was confirmed via radiographic tracking which showed successful balloon inflation, indicating both that the protective coating dissolved as designed and the balloon inflated as designed, regardless of the presence of matter in the lumen of the intestinal tract.
 No volunteers reported difficulty in swallowing the capsule, nor did any study participant report experiencing pain or sensing an awareness upon balloon deployment.
 Our Pipeline Programs
 RT-101: Octreotide for the treatment of NETs and acromegaly
 Market overview
 Octreotide, developed by Novartis AG and sold under the brand name Sandostatin®, is a truncated and modified form of the human somatostatin. Somatostatin is a peptide hormone involved in the regulation of the endocrine system. It acts as an inhibitory hormone and influences hGH release, insulin and glucagon secretion, regional blood flow, gastric acid secretion, intestinal mobility, and neuronal activity. Octreotide is a more potent mimetic with a significantly longer half-life than naturally occurring somatostatin.
 Octreotide is currently approved by the FDA and EMA for the symptomatic treatment of acromegaly, a disorder involving the secretion of excessive growth hormone, as well as carcinoid syndrome, a condition involving neuroendocrine tumors (“NETs”) of the GI tract. Current treatment using octreotide involves painful subcutaneous injections administered three to four times daily or an extended-release formulation via painful, deep intramuscular injections every four weeks. Despite the inconvenience of the current route of administration, the worldwide market for octreotide in 2020 was approximately $2.7 billion. A chemistry-based attempt to develop an oral version of octreotide for treatment of acromegaly (MYCAPSSA from Amryt Pharma Plc) resulted in a product with less than 1% bioavailability, which, due to this low bioavailability, was approved only for maintenance therapy of acromegaly patients on a low (100 µg) dose.
The total patient population of NETs and acromegaly in the United States is estimated to be around 200,000. Approximately 12,000 new cases of NETs and 3,000 new cases of acromegaly are diagnosed annually in the United States. The worldwide market for injectable somatostatin analogs is approximately $6.0 billion annually across both indications.


Our solution: RT-101
 We are developing RT-101, the RaniPill capsule containing a novel formulation of octreotide, for oral treatment of NETs and acromegaly. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-101. We believe that the oral delivery route provided by RT-101 has the potential to take market share from injectables and expand oral delivery of octreotide beyond the limited reach of MYCAPSSA.
 Preclinical studies
 RT-101 Pharmacokinetic study
 
Pharmacokinetic profiles of octreotide delivered as RT-101 were obtained in conscious canines, and compared to that of an equivalent intravenous (“IV”) dose of the commercially available product, Sandostatin. All animals receiving RT-101 tolerated the oral administration of the capsule. For the RT-101 group, the average maximum concentration (“Cmax”) was 9.9 ± 1.2 ng/ml and average time to maximum concentration (“Tmax”) for the group was 22 ± 3 minutes after payload delivery. The average absolute bioavailability of octreotide delivered via RT-101 was 78%.
 RT-101 seven-day, repeat-dose GLP study
 Tolerability and reliability of RT-101 was assessed in a seven-day administration study in canines, under GLP guidelines. RT-101 was orally administered daily to test group animals, and control group animals received an enteric-coated capsule containing nonpareil sugar. Blood samples were collected after each RT-101 dose was administered to confirm successful payload delivery by measuring plasma concentrations of the drug. Plasma samples analyzed from test group animals showed that 77% of the administered devices successfully delivered the drug, with seven of eight animals having at least five successful payload deliveries over the seven-day dosing period. RT-101 was well tolerated by all animals in the study. There were no clinical adverse effects observed in either group throughout the study duration. The GI tract was critically evaluated in all animals and no significant macroscopic or microscopic abnormalities were observed in any animal. These results demonstrated that the RaniPill capsule can be consumed on a daily basis for seven days, deploys within the targeted region of the small intestine without causing any adverse clinical effects, and remnants get excreted without complications.
Clinical trials
 Endoscopic delivery of octreotide into the jejunum of healthy volunteers
To obtain early proof-of-concept data, we evaluated PK of Sandostatin (a commercial formulation of octreotide) delivered via a direct injection into the jejunal wall to mimic the intended route of delivery by the RaniPill capsule. Results from this study, which involved five healthy volunteers, showed a highly similar PK profile of octreotide delivered by a direct injection into the intestinal wall to that obtained with RT-101 in its Phase 1 clinical trial. (See below RT-101 Phase 1 study). These data indicate that a change in formulation of octreotide from liquid to solid form did not significantly affect the PK of the drug.
 RT-101 Phase 1 study
We conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial with RT-101 in 62 healthy subjects to evaluate safety and tolerability as primary endpoints and bioavailability as a secondary endpoint. Bioavailability of octreotide delivered via RT-101 was 65% relative to an intravenous control group. We believe this is the first demonstration of such high bioavailability of an oral biologic in humans. To date, the best published bioavailability for oral octreotide is approximately 1%. The results of the RT-101 Phase 1 clinical trial support the utility of the RaniPill capsule to deliver octreotide orally, and at levels of octreotide comparable to subcutaneous injection. In addition, the results indicate that the RaniPill capsule may be used for other biologics.
 A similar study conducted in awake canines shows that the data from the canine model were consistent with the PK data obtained in humans, indicating that the canine is an appropriate model for octreotide.
Future clinical trials
 We are currently optimizing the formulation for RT-101, to potentially enable once daily dosing. Once optimized, we will test and verify the formulation in appropriate animal models. Once the formulation is validated, we plan to initiate additional clinical trials for the development of RT-101.


RT-102: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) for the treatment of osteoporosis
Market overview
 Osteoporosis is a bone disease where bone mineral density and bone mass decreases, leading to a decrease in bone strength that can increase the risk of fractures. Osteoporosis affects women and men of all races and ethnic groups. Osteoporosis can occur at any age, although the risk for developing the disease increases with age.
PTH is an effective bone-building treatment for osteoporosis. PTH is a hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands that regulates serum calcium concentration and promotes bone growth. PTH therapies are delivered by daily subcutaneous injections for up to two years. Approximately ten million Americans suffer from osteoporosis; however, we estimate that only a small fraction of this population is being treated with a form of PTH. While there may be other reasons for this, we believe that patient aversion to daily injections may be a major factor. As a result, non-bone-building and less effective antiresorptive drugs are used as first line therapies because they are available in oral form.
 Teriparatide, a synthetic form of the natural human parathyroid hormone hPTH(1-34), is a PTH analog administered as a once-daily injection to treat osteoporosis, first developed by Eli Lilly and Company and sold under the brand name Forteo. Another PTH analog injectable is Tymlos by Radius Health, Inc., approved in 2017. A teriparatide biosimilar injectable by Pfenex, Inc. was approved in 2019. Annual sales revenue of PTH analogs and biosimilars globally in 2021 was approximately $2.0 billion.
Our solution: RT-102
 We are developing RT-102, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of PTH, for oral treatment of osteoporosis. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-102. In addition to the existing market, we believe there is an opportunity to expand the market by advancing RT-102 as a first line therapy for osteoporosis.
 Preclinical studies
Dose escalation study
 We conducted a preclinical study with RT-102 where PK of PTH was determined in awake canines at varying dosage levels of teriparatide formulation. Reference PK curves were also generated using Forteo administered at the approved dose and route of delivery of 20 µg subcutaneous liquid injection.
 RT-102 yielded steep increases in concentration of PTH followed by a rapid decline to baseline levels, similar to the subcutaneous controls. Such a profile is desirable to produce an osteoanabolic effect. The overall duration of drug exposures remained short with drug concentrations returning to baseline levels within three hours. RT-102 was well tolerated by all animals with no significant adverse events noted at any of the doses tested.
 Pharmacodynamics - rodent study
 We conducted a 6-week pharmacodynamic study of the RT-102 drug substance PTH (1-34) to evaluate the effect of daily RT-102 DS intraperitoneal injections on bone mineral density in a rodent model of osteoporosis. The study compared two control groups of rodents undergoing sham surgery (N=10) and ovariectomy (N=10) receiving no drug, to three OVX groups each dosed with 5 mcg/kg per day of either RT-102 DS (N=10), teriparatide (N=10), or abaloparatide (N=10).
 The study found that, following six weeks of treatment:
•RT-102 DS increased BMD in a rat model of osteoporosis. 
 •RT-102 DS delivered via the IP route of administration was biologically active comparable to SC injected PTH analogs.
 
Seven-day, repeat-dose GLP study with RT-102
 Tolerability and reliability of RT-102 was assessed in a multi-day administration study in canines, under GLP guidelines. RT-102 was administered daily to eight test animals, and another four control animals received an enteric coated capsule containing nonpareil sugar followed by a seven-day washout period. Blood samples were collected after each RT-102 dose was administered to determine payload delivery by measuring plasma concentrations of the drug. The RaniPill capsule was well tolerated by all animals in the study. Plasma samples analyzed from test group animals showed that 61% of the administered devices successfully delivered the

drug. There were no clinical adverse effects observed in either group throughout the study duration. The GI tract was critically evaluated in all animals and no significant macroscopic abnormalities were observed in any animal.
 Clinical trials
 In 2022, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with RT-102 in Australia. The study involved a single-ascending dose portion and a seven-day repeat-dose portion. The Phase 1 study met all of its endpoints, RT-102 was well tolerated and delivery achieved high bioavailability (more than 300% greater bioavailability than subcutaneous injection). No serious adverse events were reported in the study. See the section entitled “Clinical Update – RT-102” above for more information on the Phase 1 study of RT-102.
We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of RT-102 in the second half of 2023.
 RT-105: Anti-TNF-alpha antibody for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis
Market overview
 Anti-TNF-alpha antibodies such as adalimumab are used to treat a range of inflammatory disorders and are among the largest selling class of pharmaceutical drugs globally as measured by revenue. Adalimumab, sold by AbbVie Inc. under the brand name Humira, generated sales of approximately $21.2 billion in 2022. Adalimumab is approved by the FDA and EMA to treat a range of autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease. In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated one and one-half million patients with rheumatoid arthritis, seven million with psoriasis, and three million with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. Currently, eight Humira biosimilars have been approved by the FDA, and are expected to enter the U.S. market over the course of 2023, prevented from entering earlier per licensing agreements with the originator.
Patients who use adalimumab administer the drug through a subcutaneous injection once every two weeks. Despite the painful injections required to administer it, adalimumab was the best-selling drug globally in 2020.
 Our solution: RT-105
We are developing RT-105, the RaniPill capsule containing a formulation of adalimumab, for oral treatment of a host of inflammatory conditions, beginning with treatment of psoriatic arthritis and later expanding to other indications for which TNF-alpha inhibitors are approved. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-105. We believe that the development of an orally administered anti-TNF-alpha antibody represents a significant market opportunity.
 Our preclinical studies and clinical trials with adalimumab have demonstrated the successful delivery of a large antibody via the RaniPill platform. Moreover, our studies indicate that serum concentrations comparable to the approved subcutaneous dosing method can achieved for antibody therapies using the RaniPill platform, providing compelling evidence that the RaniPill capsule could be a viable alternative to painful subcutaneous antibody injection therapies.
 Preclinical studies
 We evaluated the performance of RT-105 containing an adalimumab biosimilar in awake canines and compared it to the performance of the adalimumab biosimilar given by way of subcutaneous and intravenous injection. The PK profile for RT-105 was comparable to the profile for subcutaneous administration, and mean bioavailability for RT-105 was 49%, compared to 46% with subcutaneous injection.
Clinical trials
 Endoscopic administration of adalimumab into the jejunum of healthy human volunteers
To assess whether the observations from preclinical studies regarding absorption of adalimumab through the intestinal wall translate to clinical trials, we conducted an endoscopic study in humans. The study involved ten healthy volunteers and compared the PK of an approved formulation of adalimumab injected endoscopically into the jejunal intestinal wall, which mimics the RaniPill capsule route of administration, to that of an identical dose injected subcutaneously. Blood samples were obtained at prescribed intervals during a 14-day study period.
 PK profiles were similar with no notable differences observed in either AUC or Cmax. The mean AUC was 62.7 ± 11.4 µg/ml*day*kg/mg for the subcutaneous group and 45.0 ± 29.0 µg/ml*day*kg/mg for the intrajejunal group. No serious adverse events

were noted in this study, and adverse events of headache and flu-like symptoms after intrajejunal administration resolved within 48 hours. The results are consistent with data obtained in preclinical studies, confirming intrajejunal delivery as a viable route of delivery for adalimumab.
 Phase 1
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-105 in healthy volunteers in 2023.
RT-110: PTH for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism
Market overview
 Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition of low levels of serum PTH resulting in low calcium levels in the blood. The prevalence of hypoparathyroidism in the United States is approximately 115,000 people. PTH is currently approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism by the FDA and EMA. PTH treatment requires lifelong daily injections but has suboptimal efficacy. Treatment of hypoparathyroidism is most effective with consistent and sustained plasma levels of PTH.
Our solution: RT-110
We are developing RT-110, the RaniPill capsule containing our second novel formulation of PTH, for oral treatment of hypoparathyroidism. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-110. We believe that there is an unmet need for a delivery method more convenient than injection, and we further believe that the RaniPill capsule will provide for a treatment regimen that can better maintain consistent and sustained plasma levels of PTH than the current treatment regimen of daily PTH injections.
 Preclinical studies
 We are creating a sustained release formulation of RT-110 which is intended to provide continuous exposures of the hormone required to normalize the calcium imbalance in hypoparathyroidism patients. We plan to conduct preclinical PK studies of RT-110 prior to initiating human clinical studies.
Clinical trials
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2023.
 RT-111: Ustekinumab for the treatment of inflammatory conditions
 Market overview
 Ustekinumab is currently approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions under the brand name STELARA. STELARA (ustekinumab) is an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 antagonist marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. with sales of approximately $5.9 billion in the United States and approximately $9.1 billion worldwide in 2021. The latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. In the United States, there were estimated to be seven million patients with psoriasis and three million patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis in 2021.
Our solution: RT-111
 We are developing RT-111, a RaniPill capsule containing an ustekinumab biosimilar, for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. We entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Celltrion, under which we receive a license and supply of Celltrion’s ustekinumab biosimilar for development and commercialization worldwide, subject a right of first negotiation for Celltrion following completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial that meets its primary endpoint(s).
Preclinical studies
 We are currently conducting preclinical work with RT-111.
Clinical trials
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-111 in healthy volunteers in 2023.


Our Regulatory Pathways
 Test, approval, manufacture, and sale of our products are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. We detail the U.S. regulatory pathway in this section. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products such as ours under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. Other jurisdictions will have somewhat different requirements.
FDA centers: CDRH, CBER, CDER, OCP
 Each of our product candidates includes the RaniPill platform and a biologic. The RaniPill platform, if marketed without a biologic, would be classified by the FDA as a device regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”). A biologic, if marketed without the RaniPill platform, would be classified by the FDA as either a “biological product” regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) or a “drug” regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). The classification as biological product or drug would depend on the FDA’s definition of “biological product” with respect to the active ingredient of a product candidate at the time a request for regulatory license or approval is submitted to the FDA to market that product candidate. The FDA currently defines a biological product as “a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein, or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings,” and defines a protein as an “alpha amino acid polymer with a specific, defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size.”
 
Because our product candidates each include a device and a biologic, it is expected that each of our product candidates will be classified by the FDA as a combination product. The FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one center. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product, although the other centers may participate in review. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products, (“OCP”), which serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. OCP is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
 It is expected that most of our product candidates will include a biologic within the FDA’s definition of “biological product” and some of our product candidates may include a biologic that will be considered a “drug.” CDER is the lead center for review of therapeutic proteins at this time, thus most of our product candidates will have CDER as the lead center.
 For each product candidate, we will perform numerous preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, as well as perform human clinical trials. Preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and/or clinical trials may be ongoing concurrently for a product candidate in focused studies to assess various properties of a formulation and/or the platform of the product candidate. Animal studies require pre-approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee. Human studies in the United States require pre-approval by the FDA. For FDA approval of a human trial, if the trial will involve a biologic alone then an IND application will be needed, and if the trial will involve the RaniPill platform alone then an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application will be needed. For a clinical trial in which the RaniPill platform will be used in combination with a biologic, we must submit an IDE application if the lead center is CDRH or an IND application if the lead center is CBER or CDER. For the RaniPill platform used in combination with a biologic, it is expected that CBER or CDER will be the lead center. IND and IDE applications are discussed in more detail below.
 Approval or license to market the RaniPill capsule
 The FDA has specified a BLA path for seeking a license to market a biological product and a new drug application path for seeking approval to market a drug. It is expected that most of our product candidates will follow the BLA path while some may follow the NDA path.
 Our current pipeline includes well-characterized biologics that have been in clinical use for several years. We believe that we may be able to leverage the FDA’s prior conclusions of safety, purity, and potency for already-approved products in our own BLA or NDA. The degree to which we may be able to reduce the burden on our own development may depend on whether the API is the same as the original approved product. Additionally, because certain products originally approved under an NDA have been reclassified by the FDA and would now follow a BLA pathway, it is unclear whether conclusions regarding such reclassified products

can be leveraged in our BLA submissions. We intend to have the scope of the leverage that will be available from already-approved biologics clarified on a product-by-product basis for each product candidate in pre-IND meetings with the FDA.
 CBER and CDER may ask for additional testing for specific biologics, disease indications, or patient populations.
 Additional information regarding regulatory pathways is provided in the “Government Regulation” section below.
 License and Evaluation Agreements
Celltrion license and supply agreement
 In January 2023, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Celltrion. Under the Celltrion Agreement, Celltrion grants us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit RT-111 and to use certain information to support the manufacture, development and commercialization of RT-111. Celltrion will provide, and we will purchase, supply of ustekinumab biosimilar at supply prices set forth in the Celltrion Agreement. We will obtain ustekiunmab biosimilar exclusively from Celltrion for the manufacture, development and commercialization of RT-111, subject to a right to obtain supply from alternative sources under certain circumstances where Celltrion experiences supply disruption.
Under the Celltrion Agreement, we have sole right to manufacture, develop and commercialize RT-111 worldwide, subject to an exclusive right of first negotiation (“ROFN”) granted to Celltrion. Following our delivery to Celltrion of a data package consisting of topline safety information, pharmacokinetic results and device performance, and the raw data related to topline results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-111 that meets its primary endpoint(s), Celltrion will have a certain period to exercise its ROFN. If Celltrion timely exercises the ROFN, then Celltrion will have an exclusive period to negotiate in good faith a definitive agreement with us for rights to clinically develop and commercialize RT-111 in territories selected by Celltrion. In the event Celltrion does not timely exercise the ROFN or Celltrion notifies us that it does not intend to exercise the ROFN or, after timely exercising the ROFN, notifies us that Celltrion withdraws its exercise of the ROFN, or the parties fail to enter into a definitive agreement for the development and commercialization of RT-111 within the exclusive negotiation period, then the ROFN will terminate and we will have no further obligations under the Celltrion Agreement related to a ROFN.
 The Celltrion Agreement allocates rights between the parties with respect to inventions generated in performance of the agreement for the manufacture, development and commercialization of RT-111. Celltrion will own intellectual property generated in the program solely related to its ustekinumab biosimilar. We will own all other intellectual property generated in the program, and we grant Celltrion an exclusive, worldwide license under such intellectual property solely for use with its ustekinumab biosimilar. We will own all data related to the research, development, manufacture, regulatory activities and commercialization of RT-111 conducted by us. The Celltrion Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and mutual indemnification provisions. We have a right to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to certain notice periods. Celltrion has a right to terminate the agreement if we do not achieve certain development milestones, and each party has certain rights to terminate for material breach or safety concerns regarding the ustekinumab biosimilar or RT-111.
 Novartis evaluation agreement
In May 2015, we entered into an Evaluation and First Rights Agreement (the “Novartis Agreement”), with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, in which we agreed to perform certain specified research for Novartis to evaluate two specified Novartis compounds with our oral drug delivery technology. In August 2019 and July 2020, we amended the agreement to focus on one compound. Under the agreement, we granted Novartis an exclusive, fully paid-up license to the intellectual property it generates for the sole purpose of delivering that compound via any delivery route other than through use of any microtablet. Novartis will own intellectual property generated related to that compound and we will own all other intellectual property regardless of inventorship. We are currently in the process of completing our own internal testing of higher capacity payloads in the RaniPill capsule. Certain data from such testing was shared with Novartis pursuant to the July 2020 amendment. Following delivery of a report by us, Novartis will have a right of first negotiation to obtain rights to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize a specified class of biologics formulated with our delivery technology (“Novartis Field”) for a period of four months. If we and Novartis do not reach an agreement in this period, for a period of another six months Novartis will have the opportunity to make a topping bid on any third-party transaction proposal in the Novartis Field. Unless earlier terminated, the Novartis Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire time periods for which Novartis has a right of first negotiation or a right to make a topping bid. Prior to these periods, Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement at any time for convenience, and we and Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach.

Novartis has paid us an aggregate of $7.0 million under the Novartis Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and made an equity investment of approximately $5 million in our Series C preferred unit financing. As part of the organizational transactions in connection with our initial public offering, the Series C preferred units were exchanged for 404,638 Paired Interests. We do not expect any future payments under the Novartis Agreement unless we and Novartis negotiate a new agreement constructed around a higher-capacity payload system.
Changchun High & New Technology Industries evaluation agreement
In August 2017, we entered into an Evaluation and Right of First Refusal Agreement with Changchun High & New Technology Industries (“CCHN”) in which we agreed to perform and share data from preclinical testing of RT-109 (the “CCHN Agreement”). We provided CCHN with reports and data resulting from our performance of our preclinical testing. CCHN has a non-exclusive right to use this information in connection with specified activities. CCHN owns intellectual property generated under the CCHN Agreement that comprises of or relates to certain materials and assays provided by CCHN and we own all other intellectual property generated under the CCHN Agreement. Following completion of the evaluation program under the CCHN Agreement, CCHN has a right to negotiate, for a period of 90 days, an agreement to provide CCHN with commercial rights for RT-109 in China. Additionally, we granted CCHN a right of first refusal with respect to commercial rights for RT-109 in China for a period of two years following the completion of our preclinical testing, pursuant to which CCHN will have a period of 90 days following our receipt of a third-party proposal for commercial rights for RT-109 in China to make a competing offer for such rights. The CCHN Agreement will expire upon the expiration of CCHN’s right of first refusal, or up to 90 days longer if CCHN makes a bid under its right of first refusal. Prior to these periods, CCHN may terminate for convenience upon 30 days’ notice, and we and CCHN may terminate for the other party’s material uncured breach. We completed the evaluation program, however, following a strategic priority review in 2022, we decided not to continue active development of RT-109. CCHN has not requested to negotiate for commercial rights for RT-109 in China.
 There are no payment obligations under the CCHN Agreement.
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
We currently manufacture and assemble RaniPill capsules at our facility in San Jose, California. We also inspect, package and ship finished products to support our clinical trials from this facility. We are intentionally pursuing a vertically integrated manufacturing strategy, which we believe offers significant advantages, including rapid product iteration, control over our product quality, and the ability to rapidly scale our manufacturing capacity. This capability also allows us to develop future generations of products while maintaining the confidentiality of our intellectual property.
 Each RaniPill capsule is assembled through a process which involves a series of integrated, well-developed, and highly reproducible steps that have been optimized to consistently produce capsules of high reliability.
The RaniPill capsule manufacturing process

A drug API or drug substance combined with excipients specific to the drug API or drug substance is lyophilized and compressed into a solid microtablet form. The microtablet is sealed inside the microneedle and is then packaged in a tiny vial under aseptic conditions. The vial containing the microneedle is incorporated in the RaniPill capsule, which is given a protective coating. Each of these steps in the manufacturing process has been subjected to rigorous testing and process qualification procedures to ensure manufacturing consistency. We rely on non-exclusive, third-party relationships with several manufacturers for the drug API or drug substance. We maintain in-house capabilities related to the aseptic manufacturing, following FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations for drugs that contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product (“cGMP”) guidelines. Our personnel have significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage in-house manufacturing and quality operations in compliance with regulatory requirements.

The current semi-automated manufacturing process will be sufficient to support our currently planned clinical trials. In parallel, we are in the process of automating the entire manufacturing process, which we anticipate being complete by the time the RaniPill capsule is commercialized.

Commercialization
 Markets
 The key markets for our products, once approved, will be in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
Sales and supply infrastructure
 Development of our product candidates includes identifying sources that can provide consistent quality and increasing quantities of APIs or drug substance to meet our needs through in vitro studies, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, and later into commercialization. We currently do not have agreements in place for long-term supplies of any API or drug substance, other than ustekinumab biosimilar for RT-111. Availability of API or drug substance supply may inform our decisions regarding which product candidates present the best development opportunities.
 
Currently we do not have any approved products. We intend to either develop the commercialization sales and supply infrastructure as our product candidates are approved, or partner with pharmaceutical companies or distributors for commercialization.
 Coverage and reimbursement of approved products by third-party payors
 Sales of any product, if approved, depend in part on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by the payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover a product, the extent of coverage, and the amount of reimbursement to be provided are made separately, and these decisions are made on a plan-by-plan basis because there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement. As a result, one payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or that any of the reimbursement rates will be adequate.
Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policy, formulary, and reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific, clinical, and/or cost-effectiveness support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products when available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged, examining medical necessity, and reviewing cost effectiveness in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. A decrease in, or decision to stop, payor reimbursement for a product could reduce physician prescribing of, and patient demand for, the product.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price, and reimbursement.
Broadly speaking, we will face competition from current and future (generic or biosimilar) manufacturers of the branded injectable versions of our pipeline drugs, manufacturers such as AbbVie Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis AG, Janssen Biotech, Inc., etc. However, we believe that oral biologics have the potential to take significant market share from current injectable therapies. We also believe that oral biologics have the potential to expand existing markets by an early reach into new patient populations that are averse to taking injections.
 We are aware of certain other companies that are pursuing oral biologics through either device-based or chemistry-based technologies. Early-stage device-based technologies such as the SOMA and LUMI from the Novo Nordisk-MIT collaboration were reported to be in preclinical stages. Another company pursuing a device-based approach is Biograil ApS. Chemistry-based oral

delivery companies include Oramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Entera Bio Ltd., Applied Molecular Transport Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., i2O Therapeutics, Biora Therapeutics, Inc., Intract Pharma, and two with recently approved oral peptide products – Mycappssa from Amryt Pharma Plc (which announced it is being acquired by Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA) and Rybelsus from Novo Nordisk A/S. Chemistry-based approaches have limited applications because they work only for small peptides and, even then, with low (often less than 1%) bioavailability, far lower than injections. In contrast, our versatile technology is designed to deliver biologics, from small peptides to large proteins, irrespective of molecular mass and with bioavailability similar to that of injections.
 Environmental impact
 We have instituted policies and procedures related to appropriate chemical and biological material handling, use, and disposal in our facilities, and we train our employees on these policies and procedures.
 Regulations in certain jurisdictions may require us to submit with our marketing approval request an environmental impact assessment related to our biologics, our RaniPill platform, or both. Such assessments could cause significant expenditures. We may be able to reduce expenditures related to these assessments by our strategy of using biologics already approved for marketing.
 Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our current and future product candidates and the technologies used to develop and manufacture them. Our development efforts have enabled us to construct an extensive intellectual property portfolio that we believe provides us a competitive advantage. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality agreements, and facility and network security measures. Some of our intellectual property is in-licensed. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio provides good coverage for our current and pipeline product candidates.
For information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Patents
We have built a patent portfolio globally around several aspects of the current and future generations of our technology. We file new patent applications as we conduct research and development, initiate new programs and monitor the activities of others. Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date if all fees continue to be paid. In some cases, the term of a United States patent may be shortened by terminal disclaimer, such that its term is reduced to end with that of an earlier-expiring patent. In some cases, U.S. patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension), or both.
Our initial patent family has a priority date in 2009, with patent term expected to extend into at least 2030 if all fees are paid. This patent family claims many device aspects of the RaniPill capsule, and the delivery of a wide variety of biologics using the RaniPill capsule. Granted patents and pending patent applications in this core family number more than 260. As of February 13, 2023, this patent family included 71 patents issued in the United States and 139 patents issued in other jurisdictions (in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), with applications pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan.
 Our microtablet patent family includes claims covering the microtablets delivered by the RaniPill capsule. This patent family has a priority date in 2014, includes several dozen granted patents and pending patent applications, and is expected to have patent terms extending into at least 2035 if all fees are paid. As February 13, 2023, this patent family included 11 patents issued in the United States, 6 patents issued in other jurisdictions (i.e., Australia, China and Japan), with applications pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, and Japan.
 We own numerous additional patents and patent applications, with claims to additional biologics, pharmacologic properties of various biologics and various next generation devices, with applications pending in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea. Patents in these families are expected to expire between the late 2030s and early 2040s if all fees are paid.

Trade secrets and other proprietary information
We rely in part on keeping our trade secrets and other proprietary information confidential. We protect proprietary information by executing confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees, and consulting or other contractual agreements with consultants, scientific advisors, sponsored researchers, contractors, and other collaborators, prior to commencement of our relationship with them. Confidentiality agreements limit use and disclosure of our confidential information during and after the relationship. Intellectual property assignment agreements require that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived during the period of the relationship are our exclusive property. We take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Government Regulation
Regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of products such as those we are developing. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable regulations at any time during the product development process or approval process or after approval may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review, or commercialization authorization, or may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial actions. In the United States, such actions could include, among other actions, refusal to allow proceeding with clinical trials, imposition of a clinical hold, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license suspension or revocation, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations or penalties.
Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
 To obtain marketing approval for a candidate product, we must finalize processes for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. These processes must address design, monitoring, control, and maintenance of manufacturing processes and facilities, and the implemented processes must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate. Our processes must, among other things, enable us to monitor several aspects of the interim and finished product, such as identity, purity, strength, quality, potency, and sterility as applicable. Additionally, stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life, and appropriate packaging must be selected and tested.
Preclinical and clinical development
For each product candidate, we perform numerous laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, as well as human clinical trials. Preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and/or clinical trials may be ongoing concurrently for a product candidate in focused studies to assess various properties of a formulation and/or platform of the product candidate. Animal studies require pre-approval by an independent Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (“IACUC”). Human studies in the United States require pre-approval by the FDA and an independent IRB, requested by way of an IDE or IND for investigational products such as our product candidates.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”), which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Furthermore, an independent IRB or ethics committee for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and an IRB or ethics committee must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the trial is not being performed in accordance with the investigational plan or associated protocols, or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if the data safety monitoring board determines that there is an

unacceptable safety risk for subjects, no demonstration of efficacy, or other grounds. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials, and clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases that may be performed sequentially, in overlapping time frames, or in combination.
 •Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. The total number of subjects included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
 •Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
 •Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects. 
 For each of our product candidates, we may conduct Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials of our formulation, the RaniPill platform, or the formulation in combination with the RaniPill platform.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or we may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may alternatively be made a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and further document clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under certain regulatory programs, such as accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for the associated product.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND or IDE safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to a particular or similar biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Investigational products
 Prior to initiating a clinical trial in the United States of an investigational product such as for one of our product candidates, the FDA must grant authorization to proceed. A request for authorization is made by way of an IND or IDE application as applicable for the clinical trial.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols to be used in associated preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies already performed to assess toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product. The IND further includes chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product.
An IDE is a request for authorization from the FDA to allow an investigational device to be used in a clinical trial to collect safety and effectiveness data. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.

An IND or IDE must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND or IDE automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND or IDE may be placed on clinical hold to resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin.
 The FDA’s approval of an IND or IDE does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the stated conclusions, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations that govern investigational product labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. Clinical trials must further comply with FDA regulations that govern institutional review board approval, informed consent, and other human subject protections.
An amendment to the existing IND or IDE must be made for subsequent protocol changes and also for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Although the FDA Quality System Regulation does not fully apply to investigational products, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational product in conformity with the quality controls described in the IND or IDE application and any conditions of IND or IDE approval that FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.
 BLA/NDA review process
 Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the product candidate for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity, and potency for a biological product. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use and/or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators or cooperative clinical groups. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCI”), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. User fees may be adjusted on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug or biologic. Biosimilar User Fee Amendments impose a user fee for a biosimilar development program at the time of the first meeting with the FDA or the initial IND submission, whichever occurs first. This fee must be paid annually.
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant, or six months if the submission is designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A

Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA)
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or NDA submission or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, (“PSP”), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, presently the FDA has a fast-track designation, a priority review path, an accelerated approval path, and a breakthrough therapy designation. Any product submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for one or more of such FDA programs intended to expedite development and review. These expedited approvals do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 •New drugs may be eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast-track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast-track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider sections of the BLA or NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. 
 •A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of a BLA or NDA designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of standard review designation under its current PDUFA review goals. 
 •Products intended to treat serious or life threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, has an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 


•The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category referred to as “breakthrough therapies.” A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-approval requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to cGMP, quality controls, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, including adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each approved product. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. Biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. We are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified contract manufacturers, laboratories, and packagers, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to them. These facilities and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed, or tested by them. Accordingly, we must continue to expend time, money, and effort on quality control for our own facilities and the facilities of others which contribute to the commercialization of our final product, to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
 •Fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
 •Product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
 •Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •The issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, and
 •Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety, efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of

the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, one or more of adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, civil penalties, criminal penalties, government investigation, debarment, or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine by physicians or their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Orange Book; Purple Book
 The FDA publishes the Orange Book for products following the NDA pathway and the Purple Book for products following the BLA pathway. Our product candidates will be listed in the Orange Book after approval for marketing or listed in the Purple Book after license for marketing, as applicable.
 The Orange Book contains information about all FDA-approved drug products regulated by CDER and their exclusivities. The Orange Book also includes patent information. The applicant provides patent information to the FDA as part of its NDA, or after patent grant. Orange Book patent listing provides a 30 month stay of FDA approval of any generic submitted via an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An applicant submitting an ANDA must, for each patent listed against the approved drug in the Orange Book, either (i) state that the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval for a patented method of use, (ii) ask the FDA to delay approval until that patent is expired (a “Paragraph III” certification), or (iii) attest that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product (a “Paragraph IV” certification), which can trigger ANDA litigation over the associated patent.
 The purple book contains information about all FDA-licensed biological products regulated by CBER, including licensed biosimilar and interchangeable products and their reference products, and FDA-licensed allergenic, cellular and gene therapy, hematologic, and vaccine products regulated by CBER. The Purple Book includes granted exclusivity information. The Purple Book also includes for each biological product a list of patents identified to a biosimilar applicant during biosimilar litigation under the BPCIA.
 Exclusivities
 Some of our product candidates may be eligible for exclusivities provided under various FDA programs. Exclusivity refers to certain delays and prohibitions on approval of competitor drugs available under an applicable statute that take effect upon FDA’s approval of a biologic or drug, or of certain supplements to the BLA or NDA. Exclusivities do not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 The Pediatric exclusivity might apply to most or all of our product candidates. For an applicant to be able to take advantage of the Pediatric exclusivity, the FDA must make a written request for a pediatric study to be performed, although the applicant may request for the FDA to make the request for a pediatric study. After the study is performed, the applicant may request Pediatric exclusivity. If granted, 180 days of patent term are added to the patent term listed in the Orange Book.
With respect to other FDA exclusivity programs, in some cases the exclusivity programs will not apply to our product candidates due to our unique formulation or oral capsule technology, or it is unclear the extent to which they will apply, or they will not apply to most or all of the product candidates in our pipeline.
For exclusivity programs that apply to our product candidates, we will consider pursuing such exclusivities at the appropriate time. However, we do not expect any of the exclusivities to provide us significant competitive advantage. Exclusivities granted to our competitors could block approval and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, possibly for several years.
 Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), and similar foreign, federal, and state fraud and abuse, transparency, and data privacy and security laws.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Our activities, including our engagement of consultants, may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending and so may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of an applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or service resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of prescription drugs, devices, biological products, or medical supplies subject to FDA approval or clearance for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, and individuals and entities, known as business associates, and their covered subcontractors that provide services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participating in government-funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, government investigations, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and market share, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Healthcare reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, or expanding access.
In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care

and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), which was enacted in March 2010, contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress.
 Moreover, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to additional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA, or the impact any changes to the ACA may have on our ability to commercialize products or the prices we are able to obtain.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their commercial products. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control drug pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Data privacy and security obligations

In the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, receive, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, share and store (commonly known as processing) proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, including personal data, intellectual property, trade secret, and proprietary information owned or controlled by ourselves or third parties (collectively, sensitive information). We, and the third parties upon whom we rely, use information technology, software and services to process other sensitive information. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”). In

addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy and security laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act.
 Obligations related to the processing of personal data worldwide is rapidly evolving. The number and scope of data privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or in conflict with other data processing obligations. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements, including our relationship with our CROs or other vendors who process data on our behalf, comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations will involve substantial costs.
Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification, and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. Additional requirements may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstance. European data protection laws, such as the EU GDPR, also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area.
 Various data privacy and security laws in the U.S. also impose compliance obligations. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. Although the CCPA exempts certain data processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to the personal data we maintain about California residents. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit the use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
 Employees

Organizational Transactions
 
Rani Holdings was formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2021 for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its Class A common stock, to facilitate certain organizational transactions, and to operate the business of Rani LLC and its consolidated subsidiary at such time, RMS. In connection with the IPO, we established a holding company structure with Rani Holdings as a holding company and its principal asset is the Class A common units (“Class A Units”) of Rani LLC that it owns. As the sole managing member of Rani LLC, Rani Holdings operates and controls all of Rani LLC’s operations, and through Rani LLC, conducts all of Rani LLC’s business.
 In connection with the IPO, we were party to the following organizational transactions (the “Organizational Transactions”):
 •Amended and restated Rani LLC’s operating agreement (the “Rani LLC Agreement”) to appoint Rani Holdings as the sole managing member of Rani LLC and effectuated an exchange of all outstanding interests in Rani LLC into Class A Units and an equal number of voting noneconomic Class B units.


•Amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to provide for the issuance of (i) Class A common stock, each share of which entitles its holders to one vote per share, (ii) Class B common stock, each share of which entitles its holders to ten votes per share on all matters presented to the Company's stockholders, (iii) Class C common stock, which has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law and (iv) preferred stock.
 •Certain holders of Class A Units tendered their Class A Units for shares of our Class A common stock. Certain holders of Class A Units continued to hold such Class A Units (“Continuing LLC Owners”) and received shares of our Class B common stock.
 •Continuing LLC Owners are entitled to exchange, subject to the terms of the Rani LLC Agreement, the Class A Units they hold in Rani LLC, together with the shares they hold of our Class B common stock (together referred to as a "Paired Interest"), in return for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis provided that, at our election, we may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock or make a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each Paired Interest redeemed. Any shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled on a one-for-one basis if we, at the election of the Continuing LLC Owners, redeem or exchange such Paired Interest pursuant to the terms of the Rani LLC Agreement.
 •Entered into a registration rights agreement and tax receivable agreement (“Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) with certain of the Continuing LLC Owners.
