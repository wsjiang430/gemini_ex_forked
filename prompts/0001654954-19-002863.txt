  Business Development


  General
 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report”), references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Kingstone Companies, Inc. (“Kingstone”) and its subsidiaries.
 
 We offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals and small businesses through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), domiciled in the state of New York. KICO is a licensed property and casualty insurance company in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire. KICO is currently offering its property and casualty insurance products in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. Although in 2018 KICO wrote 93.7% of its direct written premiums in New York, we believe that New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire will represent an increasing portion of the total over the coming years.

  Property and Casualty Insurance
 
  Overview
 
 Property and casualty insurance companies provide policies in exchange for premiums paid by their customers (the “insureds”). An insurance policy is a contract between the insurance company and its insureds where the insurance company agrees to pay for losses that are covered under the contract. Such contracts are subject to legal interpretation by courts, sometimes involving legislative rulings and/or arbitration. Property insurance generally covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to the insured’s property, such as a home and the personal property in it, or a business owner’s building, inventory and equipment. Casualty insurance (also referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences related to the legal liability of an individual or an organization resulting from negligent acts and omissions that cause bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Claims for property coverage generally are reported and settled in a relatively short period of time, whereas those for casualty coverage may take many years to settle.
  
 We generate revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from our investment portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. We also collect a variety of policy feesincluding installment fees, reinstatement fees, and non-sufficient fund fees related to situations involving extended premium payment plans. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the life of the policy). All of our policies are 12 month policies; therefore, a significant period of time can elapse between the receipt of insurance premiums and the payment of claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earning investment income and generating net realized and unrealized gains and losses on associated investments.

 Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from insured losses, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling insured losses, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) are incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition expenses, such as commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including their employees’ compensation and benefits.
  
 The key measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. An insurance company’s combined ratio is calculated by taking the ratio of incurred loss and LAE to earned premiums (the “loss and LAE ratio”) and adding it to the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to earned premiums (the “expense ratio”). A combined ratio under 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting profit prior to the impact of investment income. After considering investment income and investment gains or losses, insurance companies operating at a combined ratio of greater than 100% can also be profitable.
  
 Business; Strategy
  
 We are a multi-line regional property and casualty insurance company writing business exclusively through retail and wholesale agents and brokers (“producers”) appointed by our wholly owned subsidiary, KICO. We are licensed to write insurance policies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
 
 We seek to deliver an attractive return on capital and to provide consistent earnings growth through underwriting profits and income from our investment portfolio. Our goal is to allocate capital efficiently to those lines of business that generate sustainable underwriting profits and to avoid lines of business for which an underwriting profit is not likely. Our strategy is to be the preferred multi-line property and casualty insurance company for selected producers in the geographic markets in which we operate. We believe producers place profitable business with us because we provide excellent, consistent service to insureds and claimants. Producers also value our financial stability coupled with competitive rate and commission structures. We offer a variety of personal and commercial lines products that further differentiate us from other companies that distribute through our selected producers.
  
 Our principal objectives are to grow profitably while managing risk through prudent use of reinsurance in order to strengthen our capital base. We generate underwriting income through adequate pricing of insurance policies and by effectively managing our other underwriting and operating expenses. We are pursuing profitable growth by increasing the volume of business that we write with existing producers in existing markets, by developing new geographic markets and producer relationships, and by introducing niche products that are relevant to our producers and insureds.
  
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our gross written premiums totaled $146.7 million, an increase of 20.7% from the $121.6 million in gross written premium for the year ended December 31, 2017.
   
  Product Lines
 
 Our product lines include the following:
 
 Personal lines - Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners and dwelling fire multi-peril, cooperative/condominiums, renters, and personal umbrella policies. Personal lines policies accounted for 81.8% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018.
    
   
5


  
 
 Commercial liability - We offer businessowners policies that consist primarily of small business retail, service and office risks with limited a residential exposure. We also write artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with seven or fewer employees.  In addition, we write special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized risks and businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we write commercial umbrella policies above our supporting commercial lines policies. Commercial lines policies accounted for 11.4% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
 Livery physical damage - We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs, primarily based in New York City. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included. These policies accounted for 6.7% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
 Other - We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations. These policies accounted for 0.1% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
  Our Competitive Strengths
 
  History of Growing Our Profitable Operations
  
 KICO has been in operation in the State of New York for over 130 years. We have consistently grown the amount of profitable business that we write by introducing new products, increasing volume written with our selected producers in existing markets, and developing new producer relationships and markets. KICO has earned an underwriting profit in each of the past ten years, including in 2012 and 2013 when our financial results were adversely impacted by Superstorm Sandy. The extensive heritage of our insurance company subsidiary and our commitment to the markets in which we operate is a competitive advantage with producers and insureds.
 Strong Producer Relationships
  
 Within our selected producers’ offices, we compete with other property and casualty insurance carriers available to those producers. We carefully select the producers that distribute our insurance policies and continuously monitor and evaluate their performance. We believe our insurance producers value their relationships with us because we provide excellent, consistent personal service coupled with competitive rates and commission levels. We have consistently been rated by insurance producers as above average in the important areas of underwriting, claims handling and service. In the biennial performance surveys conducted by the Professional Insurance Agents of New York and New Jersey of its membership since 2010, KICO was rated as one of the top performing insurance companies in New York, twice ranking as the top rated carrier among all those surveyed. Our relationship with Selected Producers was further strengthened by the A.M. Best upgrade to a financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) in April 2017. This has allowed us to provide many producers with an A- rated carrier option that was not previously available to them in the markets where we operate.
  
 We offer our selected producers access to a variety of personal and commercial lines products, including some that are unique to us. Many of our producers write multiple lines of business with us which is an advantage relative to competitors that are focused on a single product. We provide a multi-policy discount on homeowners policies in order to attract and retain more of this multi-line business. We have had a consistent presence in the New York market and our producers value the longevity of the relationship. We believe that the excellent service provided to our selected producers, our broad product offerings, and our consistent prices and financial stability provide a strong foundation for continued profitable growth.

  Sophisticated Underwriting and Risk Management Practices
  
 We believe that a significant underwriting advantage exists due to our local market presence and expertise. Our underwriting process evaluates and screens out certain risks based on property reports, individual insurance scoring, and information collected from physical property inspections and driving records. We maintain certain policy exclusions that reduce our exposure to risks that can create severe losses. We target a preferred risk profile in order to reduce adverse selection from risks seeking the lowest premiums and minimal coverage levels.
  
 Our underwriting procedures, premium rates and policy terms support the underwriting profitability of our personal lines policies. We apply premium surcharges for certain coastal properties and maintain deductibles for hurricane-prone exposures in order to provide an appropriate premium for the risk of loss. We manage coastal risk exposure through use of individual catastrophe risk scoring and prudent use of reinsurance.
  
 Our underwriting expertise and risk management practices enable us to profitably write personal and commercial lines business in our markets without the need for frequent rate adjustments, in contrast to many of our competitors. We believe that consistency in rates and availability of our insurance products are important factors in maintaining our selected producer relationships.
  
  Effective Utilization of Reinsurance
  
 Our reinsurance treaties allow us to limit our exposure to the financial impact of catastrophe losses and to reduce our net liability on individual risks. Our reinsurance program is structured to enable us to grow our premium volume while maintaining regulatory capital and other financial ratios within thresholds used for regulatory oversight purposes.
  
 Our reinsurance program also provides income from ceding commissions earned pursuant to quota share reinsurance contracts. The income we earn from ceding commissions typically exceeds our fixed operating costs, which consist of other underwriting expenses. Quota share reinsurance treaties transfer a portion of the profit (or loss) associated with the subject insurance policies to the reinsurers. We believe that the continued reduction in our reliance on quota share reinsurance could increase our overall net underwriting profits.
  
  Scalable, Low-Cost Operations
  
 We focus on efficiently managing our expenses, and invest in tools and processes that improve the effectiveness of underwriting risks and processing claims. We evaluate the costs and benefits of each new tool or process in order to achieve optimal results. While the majority of our policies are written for risks in downstate New York, our Kingston, New York location provides a low-cost operating environment. We now have a dedicated customer service unit located in Kingston that has significantly improved the speed at which we respond to customers.
  
   
7


  
 
 We continue to invest in improving our online application and quoting systems for our personal lines and commercial products. We have leveraged a paperless workflow management and document storage tool that has improved efficiency and reduced costs. In late 2017, we introduced an online payment portal that provides the ability for insureds to make payments and to view policy information for all of our products in one location. Our ability to control the growth of our operating and other expenses while expanding our operations and growing revenue at a higher rate is a key component of our business model and is important to our future financial success.
   
  Underwriting and Claims Management Philosophy
 
 Our underwriting philosophy is to target niche risk segments for which we have detailed expertise and can take advantage of market conditions. We monitor results on a regular basis and our selected producers are reviewed by management on at least a quarterly basis.
 
 We believe that our rates are appropriately competitive with other carriers in our target markets.  We believe that rate consistency and the reliable availability of our products is important to producers.  We do not seek to grow by competing based solely upon price.  We seek to develop long-term relationships with our selected producers who understand and appreciate the consistent path we have chosen.  We carefully underwrite our business utilizing industry claims databases, insurance scoring reports, physical inspection of risks and other individual risk underwriting tools. We write homeowners and dwelling fire business in coastal markets and are cognizant of our exposure to hurricanes. We have mitigated this risk through appropriate catastrophe reinsurance and application of hurricane deductibles. We handle claims fairly while ensuring that coverage provisions and exclusions are properly applied. Our claims and underwriting expertise supports our ability to grow our profitable business.
 
  Distribution
  
 We generate business through our relationships with over 500 producers. We carefully select our producers by evaluating numerous factors such as their need for our products, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent, product and market knowledge, and agency size. We only distribute through agents and have never sought to distribute our products direct to the consumer. We monitor and evaluate the performance of our producers through periodic reviews of volume and profitability. Our senior executives are actively involved in managing our producer relationships.
 
 Each producer is assigned to a personal and commercial lines underwriter and the producer can call that underwriter directly on any matter. We believe that the close relationship and personal service received from with their underwriters is a principal reason producers place their business with us. Our producers have access to a KICO website portal that provides them the ability to quote risks for various products and to review policy forms and underwriting guidelines for all lines of business. We send out frequent “Producer Grams” in order to inform our producers of updates at KICO. In addition, we have an active Producer Council, made up of 11 active producers, to advise us on market developments; and we have at least one annual meeting with all of our producers.
 
  Competition; Market
  
 The insurance industry is highly competitive. We constantly assess and make projections for the market conditions and prices for our products, but we cannot fully know our profitability until all claims have been reported and settled.
  
 Our policyholders are located primarily in the downstate regions of New York State, but we are actively growing into other Northeast markets, including New Jersey and Rhode Island during 2017 followed by Massachusetts in 2018. In addition, we are licensed to write insurance policies in Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. We anticipate launching a homeowners product in Connecticut and Maine in 2019. These new homeowners markets align well with the niche markets that have generated profitable results in New York, and we believe that our market expertise can be effectively utilized in these new markets.

 In 2017, KICO was the 15th largest writer of homeowners and dwelling fire insurance in the State of New York, according to data compiled by SNL Financial LLC. Based on the same data, in 2017, we had a 1.3% market share for this combined group of personal lines property business. We compete with large national carriers as well as regional and local carriers in the property and casualty marketplace in New York and other states. We believe that many national and regional carriers have chosen to limit their rate of premium growth or to decrease their presence in Northeastern states due to the relatively high coastal population and associated catastrophe risk that exists in the region.
  
 Given present market conditions, we believe that we have the opportunity to significantly expand the size of our personal and commercial lines business in New York, New Jersey, and other northeastern states in which we are licensed.
  
  Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves
  
 We are required to establish reserves for incurred losses that are unpaid, including reserves for claims and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”), which represent the expenses of settling and adjusting those claims. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date, whether already known to us or not yet reported. We establish these reserves after considering all information known to us as of the date they are recorded.
  
 Loss reserves fall into two categories: case reserves for reported losses and LAE associated with specific reported claims, and reserves for losses and LAE that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). We establish these two categories of loss reserves as follows:
  
 Reserves for reported losses - When a claim is received, we establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of its ultimate settlement and its estimated loss expenses. We establish case reserves based upon the known facts about each claim at the time the claim is reported and we may subsequently increase or reduce the case reserves as additional facts and information about each claim develops.
  
 IBNR reserves - We also estimate and establish reserves for loss and LAE amounts incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). IBNR reserves are calculated in bulk as an estimate of ultimate losses and LAE less reported losses and LAE. There are two types of IBNR; the first is a provision for claims that have occurred but are not yet reported or known. We refer to this as ‘Pure’ IBNR, and due to the fact that we write primarily quickly reported property lines of business, this type of IBNR does not make up a large portion of KICO’s total IBNR. The second type of IBNR is a provision for expected future development on known claims, from the evaluation date until the time claims are settled and closed. We refer to this as ‘Case Development’ IBNR and it makes up the majority of the IBNR that KICO records. Ultimate losses driving the determination of appropriate IBNR levels are projected by using generally accepted actuarial techniques.
  
 The liability for loss and LAE represents our best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses that are unpaid as of the balance sheet evaluation date. The liability for loss and LAE is estimated on an undiscounted basis, using individual case-basis valuations, statistical analyses and various actuarial procedures. The projection of future claim payment and reporting is based on an analysis of our historical experience, supplemented by analyses of industry loss data. We believe that the reserves for loss and LAE are adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and claims to date. However, because of the uncertainty from various sources, including changes in claims settlement patterns and handling procedures, litigation trends, judicial decisions, and economic conditions, actual loss experience may not conform to the assumptions used in determining the estimated amounts for such liabilities at the balance sheet date. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reflected in the period in which the estimates are changed. Because of the nature of the business historically written, we believe that we have limited exposure to asbestos and environmental claim liabilities.

 We engage an independent external actuarial specialist (the ‘Appointed Actuary’) to opine on our recorded statutory reserves. The Appointed Actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses, along with a range and recommended central estimate of IBNR reserve amounts. Our carried IBNR reserves are based on an internal actuarial analysis and reflect management’s best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE liabilities, and fall within the range of those determined as reasonable by the Appointed Actuary.
  
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Principal Revenue and Expense Items” in Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 2 and Note 11 in the accompanying Financial Statements for additional information and details regarding our LAE.
   Reconciliation of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses
 
 The table below shows the reconciliation of loss and LAE on a gross and net basis, reflecting changes in losses incurred and paid losses:

Balance at end of period | $56,197,106 | $48,799,622 


 
 Our claims reserving practices are designed to set reserves that, in the aggregate, are adequate to pay all claims at their ultimate settlement value.
 
  Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development
 
 The table below shows the net loss development of reserves held as of each calendar year-end from 2008 through 2018.
 
 The first section of the table reflects the changes in our loss and LAE reserves after each subsequent calendar year of development. The table displays the re-estimated values of incurred losses and LAE at each succeeding calendar year-end, including payments made during the years indicated. The second section of the table shows by year the cumulative amounts of loss and LAE payments, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, as of the end of each succeeding year. An example with respect to the net loss and LAE reserves of $6,001,000 as of December 31, 2009 is as follows. By December 31, 2011 (two years later), $3,992,000 had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of December 31, 2009. The re-estimated ultimate reserves for those claims as of December 31, 2011 (two years later) had grown to $6,393,000.
 
 The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents, as of December 31, 2018, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the amounts as originally estimated. A redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate. A deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate. Estimates for the liabilities in place as of more recent evaluation dates have developed more favorably than those from older evaluation points, especially as a percentage of the starting estimate.

               Reinsurance 
 We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to protect against possible catastrophes, to remain within a target ratio of net premiums written to policyholders’ surplus, and to expand our underwriting capacity. Participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Our reinsurance program is structured to reflect our obligations and goals.

 Reinsurance via quota share allows a carrier to write business without increasing its underwriting leverage above a level determined by management. The business written under a quota share reinsurance structure obligates a reinsurer to assume some portion of the risks involved, and gives the reinsurer the profit (or loss) associated with such in exchange for a ceding commission.  We have determined it to be in the best interests of our shareholders to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance.  This will result in higher earned premiums and a reduction in ceding commission revenue in future years but will allow us to retain more net income from our profitable business.
 
 Our quota share reinsurance treaties in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018 for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners policies, were covered under the July 1, 2017/June 30, 2018 treaty year and the new treaty year that began on July 1, 2018 (“2017/2019 Treaty”) (two year treaty). In August 2018, we terminated our contract with one of the reinsurers that was a party to the 2017/2019 Treaty. This termination was retroactive to July 1, 2018 and had the effect of reducing the quota share ceding rate to 10% from 20%.
  
  Excess of loss contracts provide coverage for individual loss occurrences exceeding a certain threshold. The quota share reinsurance treaties inure to the benefit of our excess of loss treaties, as the maximum net retention on any single risk occurrence is first limited through the excess of loss treaty, and then that loss is shared again through the quota share reinsurance treaty. Our maximum net retention under the quota share and excess of loss treaties for any one personal lines occurrence for dates of loss on or after July 1, 2018 is $900,000. Commercial lines policies are not subject to a quota share reinsurance treaty. Our maximum net retention under the excess of loss treaties for any one commercial general liability occurrence for dates of loss on or after July 1, 2018 is $750,000.
  
 We earn ceding commission revenue under the quota share reinsurance treaties based on a provisional commission rate on all premiums ceded to the reinsurers as adjusted by a sliding scale based on the ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each agreement. The sliding scale provides minimum and maximum ceding commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios.
 
 Under the 2017/2019 Treaty and 2016/2017 Treaty, KICO is receiving a higher upfront fixed provisional rate than in prior years’ treaties. In exchange for the higher provisional rate, KICO has a reduced opportunity to earn sliding scale contingent commissions.
  
 The 2017/2019 Treaty and the 2016/2017 Treaty are on a “net” of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the “gross” arrangement that existed in prior treaties. Under a “net” arrangement, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased directly by us. Since we pay for all of the catastrophe coverage, none of the losses covered under a catastrophic event will be included in the quota share ceded amounts, drastically reducing the adverse impact that a catastrophic event can have on ceding commissions.
 
 In 2018, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance to provide coverage of up to $450,000,000 for losses associated with a single event. One of the most commonly used catastrophe forecasting models prepared for us indicates that the catastrophe reinsurance treaties provide coverage in excess of our estimated probable maximum loss associated with a single more than one-in-250 year storm event. The direct retention for any single catastrophe event is $5,000,000. Effective July 1, 2018 losses on personal lines policies are subject to the 10% quota share treaty, which results in a net retention by us of $4,500,000 of exposure per catastrophe occurrence. Effective July 1, 2018, we have reinstatement premium protection on the first $210,000,000 layer of catastrophe coverage in excess of $5,000,000. This protects us from having to pay an additional premium to reinstate catastrophe coverage for an event up to this level.

  Ratings
 
 Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business and from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. A.M. Best financial strength ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company’s balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company’s capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. A.M. Best financial strength ratings are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer’s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors.

 In November 2016, we commenced a plan of action to upgrade KICO’s A.M. Best rating. In April 2017, A.M. Best upgraded the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of KICO to A- (Excellent) from B++ (Good). The A.M. Best financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) has created significant additional demand from our existing producers, particularly for our New York homeowners business where we compete against many carriers that are not A- rated by A.M. Best. Other ratings assigned to KICO and Kingstone by A.M. Best and Kroll Bond Rating Agency are as follows:
 
 
 | | Kingstone 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------
 | KICO | Companies 
A.M. Best Long-Term issuer credit rating (ICR) | a- (stable outlook) | bbb- (stable outlook)
A.M. Best Long-Term issue credit rating (IR) | | 
$30.0 million, 5.50% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 30, 2022 | n/a | bbb- (stable outlook)
Kroll Bond Rating Agency insurance financial strength rating (IFSR) | A- (stable outlook) | n/a 
Kroll Bond Rating Agency issuer rating | n/a | BBB- (stable outlook)
$30.0 million, 5.50% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 30, 2022 | n/a | BBB- (stable outlook)


  
 KICO also has a Demotech financial stability rating of A (Exceptional) which generally makes its policies acceptable to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to purchase insurance from highly rated carriers.
 
  Catastrophe Losses
 
 In 2018 we had catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers. Our predominant market, downstate New York, was affected by several events, including one large event during the winter of 2018. These claims were primarily from losses due to frozen pipes and related water damage resulting from abnormally low temperatures for an extended period. The effects of this catastrophe and other minor catastrophes during the year increased our net loss ratio by 6.0 percentage points in 2018. During the relatively mild winter of 2017, there was no catastrophe impact from large storm events.
 Government Regulation
 
  Holding Company Regulation
 
 We, as the parent of KICO, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of New York. These laws generally require an insurance company to register with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “DFS”) and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within our holding company system. Generally, under these laws, all material transactions among companies in the holding company system to which KICO is a party must be fair and reasonable and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or acknowledgement (absence of disapproval) by the DFS.
 Change of Control
 
 The insurance holding company laws of the state of New York require approval by the DFS for any change of control of an insurer. “Control” is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of KICO, including a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the approval of the DFS (and in any other state in which KICO may operate). Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.

  State Insurance Regulation
 
 Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates, and in some instances to regulate unfair trade and claims practices.
 
 KICO is required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which it is licensed to transact business. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the insurance regulators.
 
 In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the insurance regulatory authority. The state regulator may reject a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations, including those in New York, that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of KICO to exit unprofitable markets. Such laws did not affect KICO’s ability to withdraw from the commercial auto market in New York State in 2015. On January 29, 2019, KICO was granted permission by the Texas Department of Insurance to withdraw from the Texas insurance market for which it never commenced business since receiving its certificate of authority in August 2015.
 
  Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes
 
 From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that either have been or are being considered are the possible introduction of Federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers, and proposals in various state legislatures. Some of these proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”).
 
 In 2017, the DFS implemented new comprehensive cybersecurity regulations, which became effective on March 1, 2017 with transitional implementation periods. When fully implemented, in March 1, 2019, the regulations require covered entities, including KICO, to establish a cybersecurity policy, a chief information security officer, oversight over third party service providers, penetration and vulnerability assessments, secure systems to maintain an audit trail, risk assessments to include access privileges to nonpublic information, use of multi-factor authentication, and an incident response plan, among other provisions. Commencing February 15, 2018, and annually thereafter, KICO must certify compliance to the DFS with the applicable cybersecurity regulatory provisions.

 In 2010 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became law. It established a Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO is initially charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. In December 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled “How to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States” (the “Report”), which stated that, given the “uneven” progress the states have made with several near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, “Congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement.” The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers). In 2017, the new President indicated that the provisions of this law should be reviewed. In its September 2018 Annual Report on the Insurance Industry (the “Report”), FIO provided an overview of its statutory responsibilities and its role, as described in the October 2017 Treasury report, A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities: Asset Management and Insurance (the “EO Report”). The Report then summarizes FIO’s key activities since those described in its 2017 Annual Report on the Insurance Industry. Next, the Report provides a summary of the EO Report. Sections II through V are organized around the four key themes from the EO Report: (1) Systemic Risk and Solvency; (2) Efficient Regulation and Government Processes; (3) International Engagement; and (4) Economic Growth and Informed Choices. The Report concludes with a discussion and analysis of the insurance industry’s financial performance in calendar year 2017, its financial condition as of December 31, 2017, and the domestic insurance market outlook for 2018.
 
 On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law a budget reconciliation act commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Overall, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent will generally lower the effective tax rates of insurance companies operating in the United States.
 
  State Regulatory Examinations
 
 As part of their regulatory oversight process, state regulatory authorities conduct periodic detailed examinations of the financial reporting of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance regulators of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. The New York DFS commenced its examination of KICO in 2016 as of December 31, 2015. The examination was completed in 2017 without any material adverse findings.
 Risk-Based Capital Regulations
 
 State regulatory authorities impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements on insurance enterprises. The RBC Model serves as a benchmark for the regulation of insurance companies. RBC provides for targeted surplus levels based on formulas, which specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk, and are set forth in the RBC requirements. Such formulas focus on four general types of risk: (a) the risk with respect to the company’s assets (asset or default risk); (b) the risk of default on amounts due from reinsurers, policyholders, or other creditors (credit risk); (c) the risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the coming year (underwriting risk); and (d) the risk associated with items such as excessive premium growth, contingent liabilities, and other items not reflected on the balance sheet (off-balance sheet risk). The amount determined under such formulas is called the authorized control level RBC (“ACL”).
 
 The RBC guidelines define specific capital levels based on a company’s ACL that are determined by the ratio of the company’s total adjusted capital (“TAC”) to its ACL. TAC is equal to statutory capital, plus or minus certain other specified adjustments. KICO’s TAC is far above the ACL and is in compliance with New York’s RBC requirements as of December 31, 2018.
 
  Dividend Limitations
 
 Our ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Dividends are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends by KICO paid during such period.

  Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
 
 The Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) was developed by the NAIC and is intended primarily to assist state insurance regulators in meeting their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer’s business. As of December 31, 2018, KICO did not have any ratios outside the usual range.
 Accounting Principles
 
 Statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) are a basis of accounting developed by the NAIC. They are used to prepare the statutory financial statements of insurance companies and to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s policyholder surplus. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are concerned with a company’s solvency, but are also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different types and amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.
 
 Statutory accounting practices established by the NAIC and adopted in part by New York insurance regulators determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of KICO and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds that are available to Kingstone Companies, Inc. from which to pay dividends.
