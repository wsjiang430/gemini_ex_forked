ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Introduction
Acies was incorporated on August 14, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

Overview
The Power of Play
We build award-winning casual games that are among the most popular games available on iTunes and Google Play. Our games, which include myVEGAS Slots, myVEGAS Blackjack, my KONAMI Slots, POP! Slots, myVEGAS Bingo, MGM Slots Live, Tetris®, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Sudoku, and Mahjong, have been downloaded over 100 million times and were played by 7.9 million monthly active users for the year ended December 31, 2022. From social casino to casual games, each game has been thoughtfully crafted for the people who play it. As a result, we’ve been able to build a loyal and engaged community of players by virtue of our direct development efforts.
But we are not just a game company, because at the heart of every game we create is a powerful, one-of-a-kind loyalty program we call playAWARDS. It sets us apart from other leading game developers and it’s our key to building deep and lasting connections with millions of players. Every time players engage with one of our games, they begin earning valuable loyalty points and elevating their playAWARDS status. Once they have accumulated loyalty points, they can unlock a collection of real-world rewards and other benefits, that include, but are not limited to, vacations, invitations to special events, and access to our VIP services. Through our loyalty program, with a few swipes and a tap, players can be on their way to a complimentary meal, show, or weekend getaway, along with a chance to connect with other players who share their passion for our games.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, our curated collection of 96 awards partners represented more than 210 unique brands including MGM Resorts International, Wolfgang Puck, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Cirque du Soleil, and House of Blues. The appeal of our loyalty program speaks for itself. As of December 31, 2022, players have exchanged their loyalty points for over 15 million rewards with a retail value of more than $725 million.
Managing a loyalty program like playAWARDS requires a robust technology platform. We have created a collection of tools and services that allows our network of global awards partners to make the most of their in-game promotional presence. With our platform, our awards partners can launch new rewards directly into our games and make changes to their existing rewards. Then, in real time, they can see how players are responding to and engaging with their brands within our games.
Our awards partners recognize the value of showcasing their products and services within our games. The benefits, however, extend well beyond simple brand impressions, because each reward that a player acquires in our games translates to a potential customer for our awards partners. Extending these rewards to our players helps keep our awards partners top-of-mind in a way that’s entertaining and engaging, rather than transactional.
Our loyalty program provides our players a whole new dimension to their gameplay experiences. We often hear player stories of unforgettable memories and personal connections that our players have made through our real-world rewards. And that is what makes PLAYSTUDIOS so much more than a game company.
The Loyalty Lift
Successful games, just like most forms of creative content, move through a predictable life cycle — from development and launch to maturity and late-stage contraction. At each stage, they are met with unique challenges, from driving discovery 
and amassing a community of engaged players, to retaining players, and converting non-paying players to payers. Our games are free-to-play, and we have primarily generated our revenue from the sale of in-game virtual currency, which players can choose to purchase at any time to enhance their playing experience.
The key to any game’s success is the ability to hold onto its players long enough to realize their economic value, and therein lies the true benefit of our playAWARDS program. By incorporating loyalty mechanics into each of our games, we believe we have changed the profile of the typical game life cycle — scaling quickly, driving deeper engagement, and realizing greater life-time value from our players.
From the players’ perspective, our in-game rewards enrich their gameplay experience, offering them something very real in exchange for their engagement with our games. This engenders an important sense of reciprocity, which is a key element in designing captivating digital experiences.
Our Loyalty Program
Our playAWARDS program is grounded in a proven model that provides our players with a rewarding entertainment experience and our awards partners with promotional access to a large and valuable audience. From our perspective as a game developer, our playAWARDS program affords us a key competitive advantage in our strategy to retain, engage, and ultimately monetize our players. The platform’s rules engine allows us to align our reward offerings with players’ preferences based upon certain qualifying criteria. We believe our differentiated playAWARDS program benefits our players, awards partners, and business for a number of reasons as described below.
We believe our unique playAWARDS program provides our players with a compelling and differentiated value proposition: “Play Free Games. Earn Real Rewards.”
Each of our legacy social casino games and our Tetris®-branded mobile game incorporate loyalty points that are earned by players as they engage with our games. Like miles in a frequent-flyer program, our players accumulate more loyalty points as they demonstrate their ongoing commitment to our games. These loyalty points can then be exchanged for a vast library of real-world rewards. Each of these games features an integrated rewards lobby, enabling our players to easily browse and acquire benefits from a curated collection of rewards. Loyalty points are aggregated across the games, allowing our players to accumulate loyalty points more rapidly by engaging with more of our games. This drives traffic across our entire portfolio of games.
It is our view that the playAWARDS program enriches the overall value proposition of our games. By complementing inherently great games with a compelling collection of rewards, we’ve been able to distinguish ourselves from our competition.
Our awards partners are able to reach new audiences and optimize marketing dollars through playAWARDS.
The playAWARDS program allows our awards partners to connect directly with a valuable mobile audience in a way that is engaging, entertaining, and cost effective. By integrating branded content and promotional offerings into our games, playAWARDS converts entertaining digital impressions into real world brand engagement. In the process of earning loyalty points and redeeming rewards, players make the journey from our world into the world of our awards partners. This activity helps them acquire new customers and reactivate ones that have lapsed. In addition, by extending restricted offers, our awards partners are able to shift customer demand from peak to off-peak periods, allowing them to optimize the utilization of their inventory.
Our awards partners are equipped with a robust toolkit to manage, monitor, and measure the performance of their rewards.
The playAWARDS platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools that enables participants in our loyalty program to optimize their participation. Our platform includes operating tools tailored to the needs of our game makers, customer service features for our support and VIP teams, and a dedicated console for our awards partners. All of these participants are empowered to manage their activities in real time, drawing on player insights to optimize the impact and value they derive from the playAWARDS program.
We have amassed a global network of awards partners.
As we have amassed a diverse collection of awards partners, the scale of our network has become a competitive edge that delivers benefits to both our players and awards partners. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our catalog of rewards offerings included 96 partners who represent more than 210 entertainment, retail, travel, leisure, and gaming brands across 
105 countries and 6 continents, and our players have used their loyalty points to acquire over 15 million rewards with a retail value of more than $725 million.
Our loyalty program extends the engagement and retention of our players and mitigates the impact of the “Creator’s Dilemma.”
The “Creator’s Dilemma” speaks to the unique challenges a game must overcome in each phase of its life cycle. This dilemma highlights the complexities of standing out among hundreds of thousands of competing games, as well as the importance of driving deeper engagement and its relationship to monetization. Whether it be early adoption, mid-term engagement, or long-term payer conversion, we believe our loyalty program enhances the trajectory and life cycle of our games. We believe that the benefits of our loyalty program are best illustrated by our retention, engagement, and monetization metrics. In each of these key measures of performance, we see meaningful increases that we believe are attributable to players becoming aware of, and ultimately taking advantage of, our loyalty program.
We grow our network of players and awards partners.
By leveraging our unique loyalty program, we grow our vibrant community of players. As our players engage with our games, they accumulate loyalty points that enrich their experience in the real world. As they consume their real-world rewards, they drive incremental business value for our awards partners, who more fully engage with our loyalty program and actively promote our games as a means of keeping their brands top-of-mind with target consumers. This drives players back to our games, where they can engage more deeply, accumulate more loyalty points, and repeat the cycle. The more players we drive to our awards partners, the more awards partners and rewards inventory we can attract. The more rewards we attract, the more we can offer to our players, making our loyalty program more compelling to an even broader audience.
Our Core Strengths
We build engaging and beautifully executed games.
We are dedicated to building fun and beautiful games that feature a captivating complement of graphics, sounds, and visual effects. We undertake an extensive internal creative review process and comprehensive quality assurance testing before publishing any new game. We constantly monitor the performance of our games to improve the overall gameplay experience.
We have a proprietary loyalty platform with a global network of awards partners.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to develop and scale our proprietary loyalty platform to over 96 partners who represent more than 210 brands across 105 countries and 6 continents. We have amassed a global, diverse collection of awards partners across entertainment, retail, technology, travel, leisure, and gaming. Our loyalty platform allows us to provide an engaging enhancement to the primary gaming experience of our 7.9 million monthly active users for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We believe the combination of our more than ten years of development investments, operational experience, integration of our loyalty platform within our awards partners’ marketing and operating practices, and the breadth of our corporate relationships are significant competitive advantages, and to replicate our systems would require competitors to invest substantial time and incur significant expense.
We are experts in live operations.
We have established “live operations” as a core competency throughout the company and have dedicated live operations teams within each of our game studios. Crafting great content is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement when it comes to building an enduring franchise. Games, and the teams that build and operate them, must cultivate the capacity to understand, anticipate and respond to player behaviors. This ability is often enabled by sophisticated tools and a disciplined process. When done well, the overall experience, level of difficulty, rate of progress, and breadth of features, can be fine-tuned to the expectations and desires of individual player cohorts. Our live operations teams closely analyze player data in order to design and deliver content, offers, and features to our players at the optimal times during their gameplay. We believe thorough effective live operations, we can drive paying player conversion, continued monetization, and long-term paying player retention.
We are committed to adding value to our player experience through rewards, service, and community.
We believe that focusing on the player experience is the key to driving player retention and opportunities for conversion to paying players. We have built a player management infrastructure that includes customer support, social media community engagement, VIP hosting for premium players, and real-world meetups and social events with our awards partners.
We focus on transparency and accountability, empowering our employees and management to drive the efficient use of capital.
We believe that achieving our potential is rooted in the alignment of our teams around our vision, product plans, organization design, and expected results. To achieve this goal, we’ve implemented a company architecture that promotes transparency, engagement, critical thinking, and shared learning. Fundamental to this structure is our studio model and rigorous planning exercise. Teams evaluate their market opportunities, assess what’s unique about their position, craft or refine their strategies, and translate them into plans that are actionable and measurable.
We have built an operating framework that consists of the tools, information systems, communication practices, and disciplines that enables each of our studios to function independently and optimize its performance. While this model encourages creativity, dynamism, and independence, it also ensures that our values as a company are deeply ingrained in all that we do. This model fosters our commitment to our employees and their growth, our uncompromising attention to innovation and the creative execution of our games, and our relentless focus on creating value for our players and our awards partners.
We have adopted certain organizational conventions to drive collaboration and shared learning. Our Council Framework consists of a collection of forums, each comprised of experts across our studios, that self-organize, meet, and advance an agenda that serves the interests of the broader business. Today we have over 10 active councils focused on areas such as monetization, data science, technology, creative, product execution, user acquisition, player experience, and the playMAKER experience. These forums are designed to drive deeper connections among our key leaders, leverage the collective intelligence from subject matter experts, and provide opportunities for learning and problem solving within key disciplines of the business.
Our founder-led management team includes industry-leading talent in the casino, leisure, and entertainment industries as well as seasoned game developers and operators.
Our leadership team is a diverse collection of entrepreneurs, product leaders, technologists, game designers, data scientists, and loyalty marketers. In each case, they bring decades of experience, and a shared commitment to assembling teams and building products that are enduring. As a group, they’ve drawn upon their vast experience to design our operating framework, implement the tools to develop our talent, clarify our strategies, measure our performance, and optimize our decision making.
We rely on data-driven performance marketing capabilities to drive return on our ad spend.
There are certain functions or areas of responsibility that we’ve elected to centralize for every studio’s benefit. In the case of player acquisition, we leverage a centralized marketing team to achieve efficiencies across our portfolio of games. Our performance marketing capabilities focus on cost-effectively acquiring players. Our player acquisition strategy is centered on a payback period methodology, and we strategically balance spend between the acquisition of new players and the reactivation of lapsed players.
We demonstrate our culture of innovation through the work of playLABS.
playLABS is an internal group of game designers, engineers, and artists dedicated to the creation of cutting-edge games, features, and content. This group is also tasked with monitoring the competitive landscape for current and emerging trends, within our current category as well as adjacent genres that might hold crossover appeal or from which new features and functionality could be cross-appropriated.
Our Growth Opportunities
We have a collection of growth opportunities that fall into four distinct categories — optimize, expand, acquire and diversify. We will continue to optimize the performance of our existing portfolio of games, attracting, engaging, and monetizing more players. In addition, we intend to broaden our focus and act on acquisition opportunities that will allow us to complement our existing franchises by integrating new products and players into our playAWARDS program, as we have done with our acquisition of the mobile rights to Tetris® in 2021, and our acquisition of Brainium Studios in 2022. In 
parallel, we will continue to diversify our business model as we scale advertising within each of our games. We also plan to introduce new playAWARDS features that will enable our players to transact directly with us, which we expect will improve our gross margins. Lastly, we’ll continue to evolve our playAWARDS platform and tools such that we can make them available to strategic partners and third parties under a SaaS model, or in our case, Loyalty-as-a-Service.
New Game Launches, Including myVEGAS Bingo and MGM Slots Live
Our strategy to date has been to expand our portfolio of games and game studios through in-house development, leveraging the talent and culture of our teams to develop innovative and award-winning games. We launched our myVEGAS Bingo game in March 2021 and MGM Slots Live in October 2021. These games represent an extension of our addressable market and growth opportunity.
As we expand into these new genres and games, we expect to leverage loyalty mechanics and our player network to seed, and then grow, each new product. 
Exclusive Rights to Tetris® Franchise For Mobile Devices
The Tetris® brand is one of the leading and most distinctive video game brands and franchises in the world. Securing the exclusive license for mobile devices globally, excluding China, fully aligns with our strategic priorities and positions us to accelerate our growth, diversify our portfolio, grow our network of players, and scale our unique playAWARDS platform.
Targeted Strategic Acquisitions
During the company's first ten years, we generally grew our business organically by assembling every team, building every product, and acquiring every player ourselves. We continually seek, evaluate, and pursue strategic transactions which we believe will enhance our business as further described below. In November of 2021, we acquired the rights to Tetris® on mobile devices, and in October of 2022 we acquired Brainium Studios LLC. Our intention is to continue to apply the resources obtained from becoming a public company and accelerate our growth through strategic acquisitions. We believe prospective game companies will find us to be a more attractive acquirer, given the uniqueness of our playAWARDS program and our overall operating framework. Whether it be a young company with untapped potential or a mature business with an established portfolio of existing games, we intend to apply our experience, resources, and proprietary assets to helping them achieve their full potential. We believe our model, operating approach, team, and scale will enable us to compete for the best of these acquisition opportunities.
Our prior, current, and future acquisition strategy is to expand into new genres, acquire proven games and brands with franchise value, assimilate talented teams, scale our audience, and leverage our playAWARDS platform to create value and improve operating performance. The genres and related games we are currently focused on include casual (match, bubble, word, card), niche (racing, sport), midcore (Idle RPG, card battler) and casino (poker, bingo, slots).
Ad Monetization
While most of our revenue is derived from in-game purchases, we introduced ad monetization mechanics as a limited pilot program and expanded it throughout 2021 and 2022 into our apps. In addition, we acquired the rights to Tetris® on mobile devices in November of 2021 and Brainium Studios in October of 2022. The Tetris® mobile game and all ten Brainium games generate most of their revenue through ad monetization. We intend to continue to qualify and scale in-game advertising as a source of revenue. 
Direct Purchase
In 2020, we developed and trialed a new collection of web-based VIP features. In 2022, the service was extended to all players, who were invited to engage with us through a customized player portal. Each portal is tailored to the player, with a curated collection of unique benefits, rewards, and real-world events. The player is also able to review his or her status and currency balances across all playAWARDS-enabled games, and should the player choose, the player can purchase virtual items from within the portal. It’s important to highlight that these players are given preferential access to unique rewards, along with virtual currency packages that are not available within the game. The VIP player portal is available to all VIP players at any tier level.
Continued Conversion of Non-Paying Players into Paying Players
We believe we can generate revenue growth by converting more non-paying players into payers. Our average daily conversion rate of non-payers to payers was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022, down from 2.7% for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. We continually assess the data about our players to develop insights that we can use to improve conversion. We also engage regularly with our players at community events and other occasions associated with their reward redemptions. These opportunities enable us to glean additional insights from our players that inform our ongoing product refinements. We intend to continue to explore new strategies to improve our conversion of non-paying players into paying players, including continued game enhancements, player outreach, live operations offerings, and data-driven player management strategies.
Increasing the Monetization of Our Paying Players
We believe we can generate revenue through increasing the monetization of our paying players. Each of our products has a rich roadmap of live events and new features focused on deepening the engagement among our existing paying players. From exclusive in-game VIP events and bespoke hosting services, to tailored pricing on store bundles and premium real-world rewards, we continue to expand the value we deliver to our players, which we believe will translate to increased levels of purchases by our players.
Loyalty-as-a-Service
Our playAWARDS program provides value to our awards partners while increasing player engagement and retention within our games. As we introduce new games and explore potential acquisition opportunities, we will integrate our loyalty program in order to drive value and benefit from our increased scale. We will continue to enhance our playAWARDS program by updating the platform and tools, optimizing the redemption funnel and growing our collection of awards partners. Our robust platform and knowledge can be leveraged and applied to other products and services as well. We also plan to explore additional opportunities for monetizing our technology, tools, and operating expertise by offering to other game publishers a tightly integrated, full-featured, loyalty-as-a-service solution.
Our Company Values
Values are not what you say. Values are who you are. At best, they are the product of self-discovery, not belabored wordsmithing. At PLAYSTUDIOS, the essence of who we are is expressed in three simple truths: PLAY better together, PLAY to win, and the game is for the PLAYer.
The founders of our company and the principals of our Tel Aviv and Hong Kong game studios have long histories together, and the importance of those relationships sets the tone for a company that places its highest premium on trust, mutual respect, and genuine regard for one another — even when we disagree. While clichés about close-knit cultures abound, we believe that in our case the metaphor of a company as family truly does apply. We recognize that building and growing a successful business requires a tremendous commitment of time and energy. Taking that journey with people you care about makes it all the better, whether shouldering a setback or sharing a success.
This leads us to our second value, PLAY to win. We all want an opportunity to do great work and to see the direct impact we have on the success of our company. And while there are many ways to measure success, for us, it’s all about the quality of what we create — about thoughtful design and attentive execution. To this end, we spend a good deal of time working through details that most people will never notice, but that do make a difference. The result is that our games have become known for their innovative features, distinctive look and feel, and level of quality that has become a hallmark of PLAYSTUDIOS.
The closeness of our teams and the quality of our content come together in our conviction that everything we create is for our players. Unlike a retail or a hospitality business, most game companies don’t have the luxury of daily encounters with their player base. While it is standard practice to continually evolve games based on a rich set of performance analytics, the importance of face-to-face player feedback cannot be overstated. Thanks to our real-world rewards and loyalty program, and an active calendar of community events, we have regular opportunities to socialize with our players in ways that other game companies cannot. Here again, our playAWARDS program affords us a distinct competitive advantage.
Our Games
Our portfolio includes 19 games. Many of our games are classic in nature with mass appeal due to their highly engaging game mechanics. Our portfolio includes both casual and casino-themed games as follows:
•myVEGAS Classic provides our players with the opportunity to build their own virtual Las Vegas Strip while enjoying free-to-play slots and table games inspired by their favorite desert destination.

•ilu by Brainium is a puzzle game solved with light, set in the boundless void of space with countless forgotten worlds adrift in the dark without the ability to warm their dark and frozen features, where players bring light and life to these abandoned landscapes.
During 2022, we also operated Kingdom Boss, a game that allowed players to be immersed in an epic role-playing game as they built their empire, forge alliances, command an army of epic heroes, and rescued their subjects from the shadowlands of exiled kingdoms. We suspended development of Kingdom Boss in the first quarter of 2022. 
Integration of Loyalty Program
In the decade since launching our first game with integrated loyalty mechanics, we’ve worked to abstract the technologies, tools, and operating practices that were central to this unique value proposition. Our aim was to transform our loyalty construct into a free-standing and full-featured program that could be more efficiently integrated into future game releases. Our playAWARDS initiative, and the dedicated team that leads it, is focused on further establishing it as the gaming industry’s gold standard. As we continue to look to accelerate our growth through new product introductions and strategic acquisitions, playAWARDS will serve as a catalyst, driving deeper engagement among newly acquired audiences.
Research and Development
We believe our ability to attract new players and retain existing players depends in part on our ability to evolve and expand our content library by continually developing differentiated games, systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and user profitability.
We have a diverse pool of talent located in game development hubs, including in Israel, Serbia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam. This provides us with a funnel of new, internally developed game concepts, ideas for improvements to our systems, and close relationships with those local game-development communities.
Competition
As a developer of mobile games, we compete with other game makers and other forms of entertainment content. Our primary competitors include Activision Blizzard (the parent company of King Digital), Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Epic Games, Jam City, Netmarble (the parent company of Kabam), NetEase (NetEase Games), Niantic, Take-Two Interactive Software, Vivendi (the parent company of Gameloft) and others. Our market is continually evolving as new developers and new games become part of our rapidly growing, mobile gaming ecosystem. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, breadth and depth of gameplay, ability to create or license compelling content, brand awareness and reputation, and access to distribution channels.
We believe we are well positioned as a gaming company with a robust loyalty program. It is our view that our investments in the quality of our games, coupled with the unique value proposition of playAWARDS, will continue to distinguish our products and drive our growth.
We believe the value of our playAWARDS program is tied to the breadth of rewards we make available to our players. Our ability to keep the program fresh and relevant is rooted in the value we deliver to our awards partners. As we continue to demonstrate the productivity and impact of our games as a user acquisition, reactivation and inventory management solution, our awards partners can increase their engagement, optimizing their rewards and the overall merchandising of the program. Driving demonstrable results is key to retaining our existing awards partners and attracting new ones. We expect to continue to demonstrate the value of our program, and in doing so, further build upon our substantial collection of awards partners and rewards.
We believe that we can compete favorably in our market. Successful execution of our strategy depends on our ability to attract and retain players, expand the market for our games, convert non-paying players into payers, attract and retain awards partners, and offer unique and compelling experiences to players. In some cases, we compete against gaming operators who could expand their product lines to include games that could directly compete with ours. See “Risk Factors — Our industry is very competitive. If players prefer our competitors’ games over our own, our operating results could suffer.”
Intellectual Property
We have 92 registered U.S. trademarks, 12 pending applications for U.S. trademarks, 19 issued U.S. patents, and 20 pending U.S. patent applications as of December 31, 2022. We create most of the intellectual property we use in our games, but we also license or otherwise receive rights to third-party intellectual property for use in our games. For example, we use licensed intellectual property from MGM Resorts International, Konami Gaming, Tetris®, Ainsworth Gaming Technology, and Shaquille O’Neal among others, as creative assets in our games. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods and include other contractual obligations with which we must comply. Certain intellectual property rights may be licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis, and accordingly, the owners of such intellectual property are free to license such rights to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to those offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Competition for these licenses is intense, and often results in one or more of advances, minimum payment guarantees, and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which decreases our profitability. Additionally, in the future, we may identify third-party intellectual property we may need to license in order to engage in our business, including to develop or commercialize new games; however, such licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We expect to continue to use a mix of originally created and licensed content in our games. See “Risk Factors — Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may affect our revenue and profitability. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer protection, electronic marketing, data protection and privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, export, and national security, which are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the U.S. There is a risk that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices and could have an adverse effect on our business. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves and our games are played in a greater 
number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations.
There are ongoing academic, political and regulatory discussions in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and other jurisdictions regarding whether social casino games should be subject to a higher level or different type of regulation than other social games to protect consumers, in particular minors and persons susceptible to addiction to social casino games, and, if so, what this regulation should include. For example, at the end of August 2020, a court approved a settlement of class action litigation relating to violations by Big Fish Games, Inc., the operator of an online social casino game, of a specific anti-gambling law in the State of Washington, in an aggregate amount equal to $155.0 million. While our games operate differently from games implicated in the Big Fish Games class action litigation, if new social casino regulations are imposed, or other regulations are interpreted to apply to our social casino games, certain, or all, of our social casino-themed games may become subject to those regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties if we do not comply. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the U.S. and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile gaming industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution, and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase, and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-game purchases, labeling of free-to-play games, regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property, or money transmission may be interpreted to cover our games and the purchase of virtual currency within our games. If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere regarding these activities may impede the growth of social game services and impair our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
We are a member of the ISGA, which promotes best practices in gaming
The International Social Games Association or ISGA is the worldwide representative body of the social games industry, a thriving segment of the entertainment and digital economies. Its mission is to educate and inform the public, policy makers, and regulators on what the industry does, how it works, and the value it generates for both the digital economy and people that play social games. The ISGA’s “Best Practice Principles” offer guidance to the industry on consumer protection, accountability, and transparency, while its research program provides insight for its key stakeholders. We are a member of the ISGA and our co-founder and Executive Vice President, Paul Mathews, is the current Chairman of the ISGA. We are committed to ISGA’s Best Practice Principles, including transparency in our game mechanics, functionality, and in-game purchase process, striving to adhere to data privacy and protection law, and providing customer support.
Data Privacy and Security
We receive, store, and process personal information, including personal information of our players and other player data. We respect the data privacy rights of our players and strive to comply with all applicable data privacy laws. However, there are numerous federal, state, and local laws around the world regarding data privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information, and current laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions leading to a patchwork of data privacy laws that are difficult to fully interpret and adhere to. Some of these laws and regulations authorize the governing agencies to investigate companies under their jurisdiction to ensure compliance, and to impose fines and other measures against companies who are not in compliance. The applicability of these laws and regulations to us, and their scope and interpretation, are constantly evolving, often uncertain, and may conflict between jurisdictions.
For example, in the U.S. we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was enacted by the State of California and effective on January 1, 2020, and establishes additional data privacy rights for California residents, with corresponding obligations on businesses relating to transparency, deletion rights, and opting-out of the selling of personal information, and grants a private right of action for individuals in the event of certain security breaches. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA. The CPRA significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California 
Privacy Protection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The CCPA and CPRA could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and commercial liabilities.
Similar laws relating to data privacy and security have been adopted in Virginia and Colorado, and proposed in other states and at the federal level, and, if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements.
In Europe, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 or GDPR, a regulation on data protection and data privacy applicable to companies processing personal data of users in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area that became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer, and otherwise process personal information (including restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information), with substantial monetary penalties for violations. The GDPR also provides that EU member states may enact their own additional laws and regulations in relation to certain data processing activities. Recent legal developments in the EU have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal information from the EU to “third countries,” especially the U.S. For example, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (a mechanism for the transfer of personal information from the EU to the U.S.) and made clear that reliance on standard contractual clauses (an alternative mechanism for the transfer of personal information outside of the EU) alone may not be sufficient in all circumstances. In addition, after the UK left the EU, the UK enacted the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act of 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law, but also creates complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal information between the UK and the EU, which could further limit our ability to use and share personal data and require localized changes to our operating model.
We are also subject to data protection and data privacy laws in other jurisdictions, such as the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados or LGPD, a data privacy act enacted by Brazil that became effective September 18, 2020, which created new privacy rights for individuals and include monetary penalties for non-compliance. We are further subject to consumer protection laws, such as general truth in advertising and unfair trade practices that prohibit making false statements about, or otherwise failing to disclose, how we use our players’ data, as well as federal and state data breach notification laws.
The scope of data privacy laws and regulations worldwide continues to evolve, and we anticipate that the number of data privacy laws and the scope of individual data privacy and protection rights will increase, and we will continue to evaluate tools and methods to help us comply with existing and new laws and regulations.
We require new players who play our games for the first time to accept our privacy policy and terms of service. In our privacy policy, we disclose to our players what data we collect and how we use it. We also provide our players with an online submission form to exercise certain rights with respect to their personal data. We strive to comply with our privacy policy and respond to requests from our players to exercise such rights. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules and regulations to which we are subject.
See “Risk Factors — We are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy, information security, data protection, and consumer protection, and these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.”
Human Capital
We had 752 full-time and twelve part-time employees in our principal office and ten studios located in seven countries as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment by us, except for certain employees in Vietnam where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. We have never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. 
We believe that our people are the reason for our success, and we have organized ourselves to maximize productivity and performance. We are also working to build diversity within our workforce. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, hiring, training, integrating, and retaining our existing and additional employees. We believe we are able to attract and retain top talent by creating a culture that challenges and engages our employees, offering them opportunities to learn, grow, and achieve their career goals. Further, we believe that our commitment to a culture of inclusion is integral to our goal of attracting and retaining talent.
We strive to provide compensation and benefits that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes market-competitive base pay, health care, retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave. In addition, we offer stock-based compensation and access to a variety of health and wellness resources.
Facilities
Our principal business operations are located in Las Vegas, Nevada. We lease space in San Francisco, California, Austin, Texas, Portland, Oregon, Tel-Aviv, Israel, Hong Kong, Belgrade, Serbia, Hanoi, Vietnam and Singapore for our game development and operation functions. We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of the litigation and claims we currently face will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
On April 6, 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, by a purported Company shareholder in connection with alleged federal securities violations: Christian A. Felipe et. al. v. PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. (the “Felipe Complaint”). On July 15, 2022, the Felipe Complaint was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, Southern Division. On October 4, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amendment to the Felipe Complaint. The Felipe Complaint names the Company, several current and former board members of the Company, board members and officers of Acies Acquisition Corp., and Andrew Pascal, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, as defendants. The Felipe Complaint alleges misrepresentations and omissions regarding the state of the Company’s development of the Kingdom Boss game and its financial projections and future prospects in the S-4 Registration Statement filed by Acies that was declared effective on May 25, 2021, the Proxy Statement filed by Acies on May 25, 2021, and other public statements that touted Old PLAYSTUDIOS’ and the Company’s financial performance and operations, including statements made on earnings calls and the Amended S-1 Registration Statement filed by the Company that was declared effective on July 30, 2021. The Felipe Complaint alleges that the misrepresentations and omissions resulted in stock price drops of 13% on August 12, 2021, and 5% on February 25, 2022, following (i) the Company’s release of financial results for the second quarter of 2021, ended on June 30, 2021, and (ii) the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and issuance of a press release summarizing financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The Felipe Complaint seeks an award of damages for an unspecified amount. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and the Company intends to vigorously defend against them; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of this litigation. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of loss and therefore has not made any accruals.
We are a party to a pending litigation matter brought by TeamSava d.o.o. Beograd, or TeamSava, and other related parties. The plaintiffs filed a Statement of Claim in May 2021 in Tel Aviv District Court in Israel, alleging claims, among other things, that we breached the terms of a commercial contract relating to services provided by TeamSava and related parties in connection with the sourcing and administrative management of personnel in Serbia who provided game development services exclusively for us. The pending litigation seeks damages of 27.3 million New Israeli Shekels (NIS) (or approximately $7.7 million based on prevailing exchange rates as of December 31, 2022). We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the defense of this litigation. Our range of possible loss could be up to 27.3 million NIS based on the claim amount of the litigation, but we are not able to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of loss and therefore have not made any accruals.
On March 2, 2021, a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, by a purported Acies shareholder in connection with the Acies Merger: McCart v. Acies Acquisition Corp., et al. (Sup. Ct. L.A. County) (the “McCart Complaint”). The McCart Complaint names Acies and members of Acies’ board of directors as defendants. The McCart Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties against members of Acies’ board of directors and aiding and abetting the board of directors’ alleged breaches of fiduciary duties against Acies. The McCart Complaint also alleges that the registration statement for the Acies Merger was materially deficient and omitted and/or misrepresented material information including, among other things, certain financial information, certain details regarding Acies’ financial advisors, and other information relating to the background of the Acies Merger. The McCart Complaint generally sought to recover damages related to the Acies Merger. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff on August 6, 2021.
Another purported Acies shareholder sent a demand letter on February 19, 2021, making similar allegations as those made in the McCart Complaint and demanding additional disclosure regarding the Acies Merger. We have not received any further correspondence from such shareholder.
