ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Kubient, Inc. (“Kubient,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2017 to solve some of the most significant problems facing the global digital advertising industry.
The Company’s experienced team of marketing and technology veterans has developed the Audience Marketplace, a modular, highly scalable, transparent, cloud-based software platform for real-time trading of digital, Programmatic Advertising. The Company’s platform’s open marketplace gives both advertisers (ad space buyers) and Publishers (ad space sellers) the ability to use machine learning in the most critical parts of any Programmatic Advertising inventory auction, while simultaneously and significantly reducing those advertisers and Publishers’ exposure to fraud, specifically in the Pre-bid environment.
The Company also provides unique capabilities with its proprietary pre-bid ad fraud detection & prevention, Kubient Artificial Intelligence (“KAI”), which has the ability to stop fraud in the critical 300 millisecond window before an advertiser spends their budget on fraudulent ad space. The technology is powered by deep learning algorithms, the latest advancement in machine learning, which allows the Company to ingest vast amounts of data, find complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. Most importantly, it’s self-learning, getting smarter and more accurate over time. This provides advertisers a powerful tool capable of preventing the purchase of ad fraud.
The Company believes that its Audience Marketplace technology allows advertisers to reach entire audiences rather than buying single impressions from disparate sources. By becoming a one stop shop for advertisers and publishers, providing them with the technology to deliver meaningful messages to their target audience, all in one place, on a single platform that is computationally efficient, transparent, and as safely fraud-free as possible, the Company believes that its Audience Marketplace platform (and the application of the platform’s machine learning algorithms) leads to increased publisher revenue, lower advertiser cost, reduced latency and increased economic transparency during the advertising auction process.

KAI
On December 6, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) approved our application and issued US Patent No 11,521,231 for our proprietary ad fraud identification and prevention technology, KAI. The patent provides intellectual property protection for KAI from now until 2040. Just two months after this issuance, in the first quarter of 2023, we announced the release of KAI 2.0. The revamped solution now comes with improvements for the entire suite of KAI functionalities, including:

● | Expanded real-time AI with 25 algorithms running in under 10 milliseconds and built-in efficiencies to significantly expand the number and complexity of algorithms in the future;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Full support for the much larger scale IPv6 protocol (to add to the existing IPv4 support);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive supply path optimization (SPO) support with ads.txt and Sellers.JSON/SupplyChain Object verification;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced support for new CTV and audio formats; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Data mining capabilities for identifying what is driving fraud at the most granular level with more than 50 specific potential causes in order to be able to take action to mitigate it.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These enhanced capabilities of our proprietary solution feature benefits for our publisher and advertiser clients. Looking ahead, we expect to continue upgrading KAI to add value-added features for our clients.
COVID-19 and Other Macroeconomic Factors
The worldwide spread of COVID-19, including the emergence of variants and subvariants, as well as rising interest rates, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical developments (including the war in Ukraine) have resulted, and may continue to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including those provided by our clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an unknown period of time until economic activity normalizes. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the size and duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations. The extent of the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the duration and spread of COVID-19 and its variants and the duration and the extent of geopolitical disruption and their respective impacts on our clients, partners, industry, and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted. For example, many of our employees adopted a hybrid work schedule consisting of both in-person work and working from home. Additionally, we began to decrease the use of our physical office spaces in order to conserve our capital for other post-COVID business development initiatives. We continue to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and take steps deemed appropriate to limit the impact on our business.
Silicon Valley Bank
On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) was appointed as receiver. Thus, on March 17, 2023, we moved the majority of our funds on deposit at SVB to other banks, with the intention to move the remainder of our funds on deposit at SVB once we have transitioned all accounting and payroll functions connected to our account at SVB to accounts at other banks, such as our depository account at JP Morgan Chase. While we do not anticipate any losses, liquidity issues, or capital resource constraints arising as a result of the winding down of our accounts at SVB, we cannot predict at this time to what extent our or our collaborators, employees, suppliers, and/or vendors could be negatively impacted by the closure of SVB and other macroeconomic and geopolitical events.
Similarly, the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has made and may continue to make it difficult for us to forecast revenue and operating results and to make decisions regarding operational cost structures and investments. We have committed, and we plan to continue to commit, resources to grow our business, employee base, and technology development, and such investments may not yield anticipated returns, particularly if worldwide business activity continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, and if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business may be harmed.

There can be no assurance that precautionary measures, whether adopted by us or imposed by others, will be effective, and such measures could negatively affect our sales, marketing, and client service efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, decrease our employees’, clients’, or partners’ productivity, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.
What We Do: Audience-Based Marketing on Our Full Stack Platform
Our Audience Marketplace’s platform enables advertisers and publishers to transact directly between each other on an open, end to end real-time bidding platform for programmatic digital advertising. The advertising inventory on our platform is available in any channel: desktop, mobile, digital out-of-home, and connected devices; and in any format: video, display, audio, and native. Indeed, we believe our single, fully integrated audience platform provides a comprehensive, fraud-minimized, transparent, independent advertising marketplace that facilitates intelligent decision-making, and automated transaction execution for the programmatic advertising industry. We optimize the liquidity and effectiveness of the advertising supply chain, increasing revenue for publishers and improving return on investment for advertisers.
Our platform offers a machine learning-powered fraud prevention solution, extremely low latency times and an audience management platform which provides omni-channel access into all advertising channels, inventory and ad formats. Thanks to our management and development teams’ deep experience with artificial intelligence applications, our platform is constantly self-optimizing, using our software’s ability to analyze and learn from vast volumes of data. We are confident that the additional data we obtain from the volume of transactions on our platform helps to make our machine-learning algorithms more intelligent over time.
Advertising is sometimes defined as the transfer of a message from one party to another for the purpose of education, motivation or suggestion. Advertisers who pay to send a message, should be confident that it arrives to the individual it was intended for and delivers its expected outcome. Our solution consistently ensures this is the case, by verifying each and every message and intended audience. As a result, we believe that we process, analyze and connect billions of audience participants and devices faster and more efficiently than the industry standard.

Digital Advertising Fraud Solution: Machine Learning Combined with Artificial Intelligence
Thanks to advances in technology, the advertising inventory that is bought and sold in these real time auctions during the bid stream is customized to each individual viewer. This viewer customization is often called programmatic advertising, a new form of advertising where advertisers are able to specifically target their preferred audiences and demographics (rather than placing ads in generic public forums such as billboards or during live events, in hopes that the coveted audience or demographic sees the ad). According to eMarketer, digital advertising is one of the fastest growing sectors in the advertising industry, which is expected to reach $835.82 billion by 2026; rising from $567.49 billion in 2022. Digital programmatic advertising’s reach includes channels such as online, mobile browsing, in-app, text messages, “out of home” video advertising (in locations such as gas stations and airports) and digital or internet television services. The explosive growth of programmatic digital advertising has created unique challenges for advertisers and publishers that want to connect and engage their audiences. One of the primary challenges facing the digital advertising industry is that, like the meteoric growth of digital advertising itself, fraud is also growing rapidly. Despite attempts by advertisers and publishers to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks, Juniper Research estimates that the losses experienced by advertisers will be increased to $113 billion by 2026. Additionally, programmatic advertising was seen by the majority of industry professionals as the overwhelming medium at highest risk of compromise to fraud. In a market of spent advertising dollars projected to increase almost 38% from 2022-2026, the total addressable market for properly servicing ad fraud is ripe for the picking.
Digital advertising fraud occurs when an ad is displayed to a fake website or Bot in an effort to falsely inflate web traffic numbers, rather than being displayed to a legitimate web site to be viewed by a human being. An advertiser that pays for an ad that is displayed to a Bot has wasted the budget spent for the placement of that ad, as it is human beings that might spend money on the product or service being advertised, as opposed to a Bot. Thus, brands and advertisers that cannot prevent their ads being shown to Bots become victims to the billions of dollars lost to ad fraud annually, as calculated by Juniper Research and Forrester Consulting.
We believe that digital advertising fraud is further exacerbated by the fact that our industry is increasingly fragmented. The most popular solutions that have emerged in the marketplace for selling digital advertising are not connected to the solutions used by industry participants for purchases of digital advertising. In other words, advertisers use DSPs to purchase digital advertising, whereas publishers use completely different platforms called SSPs to sell advertising space to those advertisers. Therefore, advertisers may not know who is selling them advertising inventory, and publishers may not know who is purchasing such inventory. With the two sides of any auction not connected, and likely not communicating with each other across different platforms, it is difficult to assign responsibility to tracking down fraud after an ad sale has already occurred. We have created a marketplace where advertisers and publishers can interact directly. This layer of direct transparency allows advertisers to more efficiently identify ad fraud, and to ensure that they are only buying advertising space that delivers the expected value of a particular campaign. Furthermore, fraud prevention is also fragmented as a result of advertisers and publishers using different platforms to conduct digital advertising auctions. Indeed, many DSPs and SSPs do not even have built-in fraud prevention solutions, instead relying on third parties to identify ad fraud after an ad is displayed. Our internally-developed fraud prevention solution is native to our platform and detects fraud before the digital advertising auction is concluded.
As a result of the fragmented, complex and inefficient infrastructure currently in use for programmatic advertising, fraud is rampant in the digital advertising marketplace. Bad actors’ use of fake websites and Bots to sell advertising space costs advertisers billions of dollars a year. A large part of the reason that widespread fraud runs rampant in the digital advertising industry is that current machine learning and fraud prevention solutions in our industry can only identify such fraud after an ad purchase has already occurred. We believe it is much harder to stop fraud when trying to catch perpetrators after the fraud has already occurred because the fraudsters have the ability to completely change the fingerprint of the Bot, which allows it to reenter the ecosystem and commit fraud again.

​

We believe it is more effective to stop fraud before it occurs than trying to catch perpetrators after the fraud has already occurred. Thus, we have developed what we believe to be the first machine learning technology that can detect fraud within the 300-millisecond window known as the “bid stream” prior to ad purchases. Our platform’s fraud detection solution, KAI is our patent-pending proprietary technology that uses artificial intelligence to analyze live advertising bid stream data to detect potential ad fraud, a major issue within the digital advertising ecosystem. KAI’s proprietary technology allows all advertisers to make better-informed, real-time decisions within this brief window of time by identifying potentially fraudulent activity in real-time. KAI is trained using different statistical and machine learning algorithms and is capable of detecting various types of fraud, including user fraud, device fraud, content fraud and heuristic fraud. KAI analyzes 100% of real-time programmatic data and industry-specific information to determine patterns and data points consistent with fraudulent activity, helping advertisers maximize return on ad spend and protecting publishers. KAI is fully integrated into Kubient’s Audience Marketplace, or alternatively, can be deployed as a standalone application or enterprise solution on third-party real-time bidding platforms. 
Latency Solution: Machine Learning
We believe that our platform allows us to process digital advertising auctions faster than the competition. Faster auctions ensure that ad campaigns create more impressions that are seen by consumers, as consumers are less likely to become frustrated by slowly loading websites or apps (which normally results in consumers leaving such websites or apps before the ad is displayed).
To substantially reduce and minimize latency issues across our fully integrated open marketplace, we use a highly specialized programming language originally designed to be used in extremely fast (but highly dependable) digital telephone communications switches, as well as quant-based speed trading of securities on Wall Street. In addition, our platform’s proprietary machine-learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, high volume storage, detailed analytics capabilities, and a distributed infrastructure that supercharges our bidding process and helps our customers place, and win, more bids for advertising space. We believe we are transforming the digital advertising industry by analyzing billions of data points in record real time speed to enable our solution to make complex decisions in milliseconds, and to execute over 1 million queries per second, billions of transactions per week and trillions of bid requests per month.
Additional Platform Functionalities
Not only do we believe our platform works faster, more efficiently and more safely in terms of fraud than our competition, we also believe that it provides added functionality over our competitors, such as real time reporting of ad sales, and an open audience marketplace which enables publishers, including websites, mobile applications, video and other digital media properties, to connect their advertising inventory more efficiently and effectively to buyers across the entire advertising ecosystem, including brands, DSPs, ad networks and advertising agencies.
In addition, our platform’s functionality allows us to quickly adapt to emerging media channels that might have been previously overlooked by the digital marketing ecosystem. For example, outdoor advertising, often referred to as out of home media, such as billboards, bus-stop shelters, public elevators, airport monitors and gas station pump placards, has not traditionally been connected to digital advertising sources. However, these traditional forms of out of home media are increasingly being converted to digital signage. Unlike their traditional out of home counterparts, these updated digital signs, often referred to as digital out of home (“DOOH”) media, can display programmatic advertising, such that all of the advantages of our Audience Marketplace can be applied to this rapidly proliferating media channel. By allowing brands, DSPs, ad networks, advertising agencies and brands to bid on DOOH publishers’ inventory in real-time, just as if DOOH screens were video screens on a desktop computer or mobile device, our Audience Marketplace will allow advertisers to scale campaigns across new and thriving media channels, thereby maximizing inventory fill rates and increasing the audiences that advertisers may target by digital means.
Kubient Managed Services (KMS)
The Company has embraced platforms, tools and a culture that’s designed to help clients achieve their required outcomes. We remain focused on differentiating by helping advertisers achieve tangible, quantifiable outcomes such as heightened brand awareness and increased sales. As such, the Company believes that its KMS offering will be able to benefit advertisers by providing: (i) better audience and performance insight, campaign control, transparency, and execution (ii) expert staff with varied, relevant backgrounds to assist advertisers, and (iii) access to quality tools and platforms for advertisement placement with an emphasis on return on media investment.

Additional Platform Functionalities
Not only do we believe our platform works faster, more efficiently and more safely in terms of fraud than our competition, we also believe that it provides added functionality over our competitors, such as real time reporting of ad sales, and an open audience marketplace which enables publishers, including websites, mobile applications, video and other digital media properties, to connect their advertising inventory more efficiently and effectively to buyers across the entire advertising ecosystem, including brands, DSPs, ad networks and advertising agencies.
Intellectual Property
We previously filed two utility patent applications. The first patent application relates to our inventory and decision management system that allows DOOH media buying agencies to purchase ads on our programmatic and real-time-bidding marketplace. This application is currently pending before the US Patent Office. The second patent application relates to our KAI real time, digital advertising fraud prevention solution. This application was approved by the US Patent Office and issued on December 6, 2022, as US Patent No 11,521,231. Since the issuance of our first fraud prevention patent, we have filed a continuation application, which covers advances in our fraud prevention technology since the filing of our first application. This continuation application is currently pending before the US Patent Office.
Customers and Revenue
We provide our customers with a platform to connect advertisers and publishers. Generally, our revenue generation process begins with publishers. When a publisher aims to fill the available advertising space on its website or app, we typically enter into a twelve-month master service agreement allowing the publisher to sell advertising inventory through our platform. Once the publisher executes our master service agreement and is accepted onto our platform, the publisher is allowed to electronically communicate with our platform through its ad server, in order to provide us information about the publisher’s advertising inventory, user base, minimum sale prices and other data signals, as applicable. We also enter into master service agreements to allow third-party exchanges that aggregate publishers’ available advertising inventory to sell such inventory on our platform. We earn a mark-up, which is the spread between what we collect from advertisers and what we remit to publishers. We only pay for inventory when an advertiser is connected to a publisher and an impression is successfully delivered. We sometimes refer to the amount we pay publishers for inventory upon the delivery of an impression as “cost pay.” As described further below, cost pay is generally lower than what advertisers ultimately spend to have their ad impression delivered on a publisher’s website or app.
We also typically enter into twelve-month master service agreements with advertisers that wish to purchase advertising inventory, either on our platform or through their DSP. Our proprietary algorithms use the industry information available (from advertisers, publishers, third parties and our own internal database) to automatically target and bid on publishers’ inventory to meet an advertiser’s campaign objective. We generate revenue from advertisers by charging them fees on a sliding scale based on a percentage of their spend on advertising purchased through our platform, the total of which we sometimes refer to as “gross spend.”
Thanks to the speed of our platform, the matching of publisher and advertiser occurs in fractions of a second, within the short time frame of the bidstream. We recognize revenue upon the completion of each matching transaction, at the moment when an impression has been delivered to the consumer viewing a website or application. We generally bill and collect the full purchase price of impressions from advertisers, unless the advertiser pays through its DSP, in which case the DSP is the entity that pays our fees. In either case, our gross revenue from each impression is equal to gross spend minus cost pay.
We consider our customers to be those that generate revenue during the period and is a mix of direct publishers, third-party exchanges that aggregate both publishers’ available advertising inventory and advertising budgets, along with direct advertisers and advertising agencies. Further, the Company’s definition of “customer” encompasses advertisers that purchased even a single impression on the Company’s platform during the period, not just advertisers that signed a twelve-month master service agreement.
We believe that growth of the programmatic advertising market is important for our ability to continually grow our business. Adoption of programmatic advertising by advertisers allows us to acquire new customers and grow revenue from existing customers. We also believe that current industry trends will lead more advertisers to seek out a better fraud prevention solution to protect their advertising budgets, such as the one offered on our platform.

Similarly, we believe that the adoption of programmatic advertising by unique advertising inventory owners, such as digital out of home content providers for which we have developed a unique solution, will allow us to expand the volume and type of advertising inventory that we present to advertisers using our platform.
KAI
On December 6, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) approved our application and issued US Patent No 11,521,231 for our proprietary ad fraud identification and prevention technology, KAI. The patent provides intellectual property protection for KAI from now until 2040. Just two months after this issuance, in the first quarter of 2023, we announced the release of KAI 2.0.

Industry Overview
Most consumers are unaware that when they browse a webpage, watch a video on the internet, use a mobile app or watch an internet-connected TV, there is often a behind-the-scenes auction for the purchase and sale of digital advertising space as the consumer’s desired content loads. In such auctions, advertisers (i.e., ad space buyers, such as sporting goods or consumer products manufacturers) purchase advertising space from publishers (i.e., ad space sellers, such as mobile app developers or website operators). Advertisers bid on each impression and if the bid is won, the ad is displayed on the publisher’s website or app being viewed by the consumer.
As the technology behind these auctions began to develop, traditional methods of digital advertising were used, where manual negotiations conducted by human brokers played a vital role in deciding the prices of digital advertising inventory to be bought and sold. Similarly, human brokers sought to place ad inventory in the digital equivalents of traditional public forums such as billboard-like banner ads or during digitally-broadcast sporting events, in hopes that the largest audience possible might see an ad.
However, in recent years, the technology behind these auctions has changed dramatically. Now, “real time bidding” has become an automated process that enables the buying and selling of individual impressions for each digital ad in milliseconds. In the blink of an eye, real time digital auctions determine what ad will display, where the ad will be displayed and what price the advertiser has to pay to the publisher for displaying the ad. The real time auction process is currently in the process of completely replacing the role of a human broker, by automating the buying and selling of ad space in a 300 millisecond window called the “bid stream.”
Another significant challenge facing participants in the digital marketing industry is the problem of latency, or loading wait times. Existing participants in the digital advertising marketplace have invested billions of dollars in large and cumbersome system infrastructures that are costly and slow by today’s standards. Their outdated infrastructure has caused hundreds of companies to provide a patchwork of solutions to address the slow and costly nature of the current digital advertising infrastructure that we believe are ineffective when compared with our solution. As a result of this patchwork of solutions, we believe the digital advertising marketplace has become complex and inefficient, with relatively long delays before an ad is displayed becoming commonplace. These delays often result in a user leaving a website or smartphone app before the advertiser’s content loads. If the user does not view the ad which the advertiser paid to place on the publisher’s website or app, then the advertiser has wasted the budget spent for the placement of that ad.
The problem of ineffective digital advertising has created large-scale lost revenue in our industry. Given that ROI is generally the main driver of digital advertising decision making, the inability to calculate it correctly, or at all, will continue to perpetuate the ineffective digital advertising environment. To combat the large-scale loss in advertising dollars spent, the landscape of marketing from the perspective of metric-based analysis has evolved. In their 2022 “The State of Marketing” report, Salesforce states that marketers are embracing more sophisticated metrics to cater to various KPI standards. The following metrics are the most tracked by marketing organizations: revenue, customer satisfaction analytics, web/mobile analytics, customer acquisition costs, marketing/sales funnel performance, content engagement, customer retention rates, customer referral rates/volume, and customer lifetime value. While all of these marketing KPIs saw an increase across the board, web/mobile analytics, customer acquisition costs, and customer satisfaction analytics saw the biggest year-over-year jumps in adoption. Additionally, a related study called “State of the Connected Customer” published by Salesforce explained that “from here on out, customer engagement is digital-first” with customers estimated to have spent 56% of online interactions with companies in 2020 and an increase to 60% of online interactions with companies in 2021. The report also shows that the younger generations of Millennials and Gen Zers to be more inclined to engage companies through digital channels. The increasing need for effective advertising spend has seemingly illuminated the increasing need by both publishers and advertisers to cut fraudulent advertising engagement significantly.

Competition
We derive our revenue from the digital advertising market, which is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, complex and fragmented. We currently compete for advertising spend with large, well-established companies as well as smaller, privately-held companies. Some of our larger competitors with more resources may be better positioned to execute on advertising campaigns conducted over multiple channels such as social media, mobile and video, yet we provide unique channels not found in the digital advertising market typically, such as the true programmatic DOOH auctions we perform. We believe that this, coupled with our other capabilities, will allow us to keep step with the larger competitors in the short term and surpass them in the long term.
While the majority of the market is dominated by two companies, Facebook and Google, we do not consider them to be our competitors. Our growth is focused in the rest of the available market and there are many companies who compete with us for that share. The Trade Desk is one of our fastest growing competitors for brand and advertiser budgets with a solid foundation and strong cash flow and client base. Their product known as a Demand Side Platform competes with our own Demand Side Platform however, we believe our platform has key advantages, such as built-in proprietary fraud prevention, direct publisher connections, a Supply Side Platform and a centralized auction hub. These advantages, in our opinion, provide us with more leverage when approaching advertisers and requesting budget. There are other platforms and exchanges that can be considered a competitor to one or more of our products as well.
A majority of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have more capital to invest in their businesses however they operate on technology we consider to be outdated and inferior to our newer more agile technology. Competitors could also seek to gain market share by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers, introducing products and solutions that are similar to ours or introducing new technology tools for advertisers and digital media properties, yet the failure of these competitors to offer transparency on pricing as we do is likely to reduce or negate such impact. Moreover, increased competition for video advertising inventory from digital media properties could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to digital media property owners to acquire that advertising inventory which is beneficial to us as our technology offers a more efficient auction thus allowing us to reduce cost for advertisers and increase revenue for publishers.
Some large advertising agencies that represent advertising customers have their own relationships with digital media properties and can directly connect advertisers with digital media properties. Our business will suffer to the extent that our advertisers and digital media properties purchase and sell advertising inventory directly from one another or through other companies that act as intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, ad exchange or other third-party solutions have or may become intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.
Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, ad exchange or other third-party solutions have or may become intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties and thereby compete with us. Despite this, we believe that they do not offer a full software suite like us, as such, the long-term effect of any interruption caused by such companies will be limited.
Our fraud prevention solution competes with the small landscape of other fraud prevention companies such as Human, Double Verify and Integral Ad Science. However, we believe that our product is the only product in this space that has patent pending technology allowing it to perform instream prevention as opposed to the landscapes standard.

Sales and Marketing
Given our self-serve business model, we focus on supporting, advising and training our customers to use our platform independently as soon as they are ready to transact. There is an element of education about our platform that requires us to invest in sales and marketing programs and personnel to grow our business. We focus our efforts to build this awareness through trade shows and sponsored events.
The addition of the KMS offering has augmented our sales and marketing capabilities by adding assigned account managers, real time dashboard monitoring, performance analysis, as well as quarterly client reviews, ensuring that our advertising clients using the Audience Marketplace have all logistics running smoothly and that any assistance they need would be there in an instant. 
As of March 28, 2023, our sales and marketing team consisted of 5 employees. The team employs a consultative approach to both new and existing customers. Once a new customer has access to our platform, they work closely with our customer service teams as they onboard the new customer and provide continuous support throughout the early campaigns. Typically, once a customer has gained some initial experience, it will move to a fully self-serve model and request support as needed.
Seasonality
Our cash flows from operations vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertiser spending. For example, many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Indeed, in digital advertising, seasonal downswings typically occur at the start in January (the beginning of the calendar year) and October (the beginning of the fiscal year for many companies). Upswings occur in December (the end of the calendar year) and September (the end of the fiscal year for many companies). This is due to the timing of when budgets are negotiated and distributed. Other swings occur around holidays, and other large consumer focused events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Platform Development
Part of our dedication to innovation means that we are constantly improving our platform, with new features and products being routinely released. We empower our development teams by encouraging them to release updated features and increase functionality fast and often. As a company, we are always exploring new and better ways to continuously improve the performance of our technology. Our development teams are intentionally lean and nimble in nature, providing for transparency and accountability.
Privacy and Data Protection Regulation
Privacy and data protection legislation and regulation play a significant role in our business. We and our customers use data about Internet users collected through our platform to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to Internet users based on their particular geographic locations, the type of device they are using, or their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activities. We do not use this data to identify specific individuals, and we do not seek to associate this data with information that can be used to identify specific individuals. We take steps not to collect or store personally identifiable information, or personal data. The definitions of personally identifiable information and personal data, however, vary by jurisdiction and are evolving. As a result, our platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each jurisdiction where we do business to avoid violating applicable legislation and regulation.
In the United States, a complex patchwork quilt of both state and federal legislation governs activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. Digital advertising in the United States has, up until very recently, primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has primarily relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits companies from engaging in “unfair” or “deceptive” trade practices, including alleged violations of representations concerning privacy protections and acts that allegedly violate individuals’ privacy interests. The FTC has commenced the examination of privacy issues that arise when marketers track consumers across multiple devices, otherwise known as cross-device tracking.

The United States legal landscape concerning data and privacy continues to evolve at a rapid, and sometimes unpredictable pace. Domestic laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how online business handle data. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. On January 1, 2023, the CCPA was amended by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CPRA”). The CPRA expands upon and enhances the provisions of the CCPA. Further, the CPRA establishes its own enforcement body. The CCPA/CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Similar privacy legislation in the vein of the CCPA has been proposed in a number of states. Indeed, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have also enacted similar statutes; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), and Connecticut’s CTDPA. In addition, a dozen other states have data privacy bills either introduced or in committee, with the expectation that they will be enacted in coming years, further complicating the compliance landscape. In the wake of the enactment of the foregoing statutes, operationally, the impact of compliance has immediate effect. To be sure, all the statues require certain access and consent rights be extended to internet users. Therefore, compliance would necessarily involve an additional layer of infrastructure to accommodate such right.
Because our platform reaches users throughout the world, including Europe, Australia and Asia, some of our activities may also be subject to foreign legislation. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including but not limited to the European Union. The European Union has adopted what is known as one of the most robust and comprehensive data protection regulations in the world - the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR and contains numerous requirements and obligations on data processors and comprehensive documentation requirements for data protection, processing, and compliance programs. In addition, the GDPR promulgates data subject rights for EU citizens, which provides increased control for EU citizens. Specifically, EU citizens posses rights of access, corrections, deletion, and portability. These rights translate into increased operational costs to companies who have to take steps to operationalize these rights in order to comply and meet any request. Non-compliance risks substantial fines. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. In additional the GDPR, the European Union is currently in the process of replacing the current ePrivacy directive with the ePrivacy Regulation, which contains enhanced protections and regulations concerning the use of electronic communications services, including in connection with online tracking technologies. 
Accordingly, once the ePrivacy Regulation is enacted, the compliance landscape will only become more challenging. Certainly, an increase in operational costs and risk will arise to the extent we continue to do business in the European market. In particular, risks associated with non-compliance proceedings from governmental agencies, as well as limitations on our ability to attract and retain European customers. 
Brazil and China have also established data protection statutory frameworks as well.
The interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are simply not predictable in light of the nascent nature of the data privacy legal landscape. These laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data handling practices or how our products and platform capabilities operate. The possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims and penalties may necessitate a change in our business activities and practices or modify our products and platform capabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
In prior years, some government regulators and privacy advocates advocated vigorously for a Do Not Track standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their browsers, not to have their online browsing activities tracked. In 2010, the FTC issued a staff report emphasizing the need for simplified notice, choice and transparency to the consumer regarding the collection, use and sharing of data, and suggested implementing a Do Not Track browser setting that would allow consumers to choose whether or not to allow tracking of their online browsing activities. All major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a Do Not Track setting. However, there is no commonly accepted definition of “tracking,” no consensus regarding what message is conveyed by a Do Not Track setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a Do Not Track preference.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, we will not be required to:

· | provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide more than two years of audited financial statements and related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or hold stockholder advisory votes on the executive compensation required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of the:

· | last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.235 billion or more in total annual gross revenues;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more as of June 30);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
Finally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year.
