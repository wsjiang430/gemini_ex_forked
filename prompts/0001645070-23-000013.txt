Sterling Overview
Sterling Check Corp. (“the Company,” “Sterling,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is incorporated in the state of Delaware and its principal executive offices are at 1 State Street Plaza, 24th Floor, New York, New York. Our phone number is 1 (800) 853-3228 and our website address is www.sterlingcheck.com. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “STER”. 
We are a leading global provider of technology-enabled background and identity verification services. We provide the foundation of trust and safety that our clients need to create great environments for their most essential resource—people. We offer a comprehensive hiring and risk management solution that begins with identity verification, followed by criminal background screening, credential verification, drug and health screening, processing of employee documentation required for onboarding and ongoing risk monitoring. Our services are generally delivered through our purpose-built, proprietary, cloud-based technology platform that empowers 
organizations with real-time and data-driven insights to conduct and manage their employment screening programs efficiently and effectively. Our clients face a dynamic and rapidly evolving global labor market with increasing complexity and regulatory requirements. We believe that our services and platform enable organizations to make more informed employment decisions, improve workplace safety, protect their brand and mitigate risk. As a result, we believe our solutions are mission-critical to our clients’ core human resources, risk management and compliance functions. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we completed over 110 million searches for over 50,000 clients, including over 50% of the Fortune 100 and over 50% of the Fortune 500.
We have built an award-winning proprietary and cloud-based technology platform. Our client and candidate interfaces provide easy-to-use and mobile-first ordering, task and program management, results delivery and reporting analytics. This enables our clients to gain meaningful insights into their risk mitigation programs, all while creating exceptional candidate and employee experiences. Our interfaces are supported by our powerful artificial intelligence (“AI”)-driven fulfillment platform, which leverages more than 3,300 automation integrations, including Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) and Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) bots. This enables 90% of our United States (“U.S.”) criminal searches to be automated and allows us to complete 50% of U.S. criminal searches within the first five minutes, 65% of U.S. criminal searches within the first 15 minutes, over 70% of U.S. criminal searches within the first hour and 90% within the first day. As of December 31, 2022, over 95% of our revenue is processed through platforms hosted in the cloud, which allows us to consistently maintain 99.9% platform availability while being prepared to scale into the future. These platforms are seamlessly integrated into over 75 applicant tracking systems (“ATS”) and Human Capital Management (“HCM”) systems and our clients’ in-house supply chain systems, thus creating relatively frictionless, fast and unified candidate hiring experiences. Moreover, gig economy, contingent workforce, and enterprise clients, who utilize proprietary candidate workflow systems, may integrate into Sterling’s platform by leveraging our proprietary API. When combined, we believe our solutions deliver convenient and easy-to-use front-end interfaces, accurate and fast results, and enable our clients to effectively manage complex programs in a compliant and cost-effective manner. We believe that our technology cannot be easily replicated without substantial investment.
As part of our strategic transformation, in early 2019, we launched Project Ignite, a three-phase strategic investment initiative to create a cloud-native enterprise-class global platform. The remaining investment, which we substantially completed in 2022, migrated our corporate technological infrastructure to the cloud and enabled us to decommission redundant fulfillment systems. We have benefited from the delivery of our new client and candidate interfaces, scalable cloud-based infrastructure for our global production platform and an improved security environment through new business wins, improved client retention and the ability to launch products rapidly to meet immediate client needs, as we did in 2022 when we developed our robust and proprietary core I-9 offering into a fully integrated I-9 solution within our Sterling platform and partner ecosystem. In 2022, we also strengthened our competitive differentiation through the expansion of our identity capabilities in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom (the “U.K”). In the U.S., with ID.me, we believe that we became the only background screening provider to have a fully integrated reusable identity workflow within the screening process, furthering our leadership position to deliver identity services for employers in the U.S. In the U.K., we became the first background screening organization to become a certified digital identity service provider and have partnered with Yoti to develop a comprehensive global identity verification solution. This new capability enables a faster and easier experience for prospective talent in the U.K. to verify themselves using modern technology while reducing the chance of identity fraud. At the end of 2022, we also launched Project Nucleus which we expect to drive meaningful cost savings and efficiency gains in our cost of revenues. This initiative aims to enhance our organization by re-engineering processes, driving fulfillment labor cost reductions and identifying and executing on additional automation opportunities with a focus on our global fulfillment process. As part of our journey of growth and optimization, in 2022, we continued to refine our corporate strategy and our commitment to delivering stockholder value by executing on the growth opportunities in front of us. We have a number of key execution elements to help us achieve our goals, including increasing our revenues with existing clients, acquiring new clients, growing market share internationally, and utilizing M&A to supplement our organic revenue growth. As part of our refreshed strategy, we have begun executing on a restructuring program to realign senior leadership and functions, with the goal of elevating our go-to-market strategy and accelerating our technology and product innovation. Over the long term, we expect these investments and strategic changes to further enhance our margins, improve time to market as we build once and deploy globally and allow us to increase innovation.
Our client-centric approach underpins everything we do. We serve a diverse and global client base in a wide range of industries, such as healthcare, gig economy, financial and business services, industrials, retail, contingent, technology, media and entertainment, transportation and logistics, hospitality, education and government. Employers are facing numerous challenges, including complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements, a rise in fraudulent job applications, a growing spotlight on reputation and a more complex global workforce. Successfully navigating these challenges requires an industry-specific perspective, given differing candidate profiles, economics, competitive dynamics and regulatory demands. To serve these differing needs, 
our sales and support delivery model is organized around teams dedicated to specific industries (“Verticals”) and geographic markets (“Regions”). Our delivery model provides our clients with both the personal touch and consultative partnership of a small boutique firm and the global reach, scale, innovation and resources of an industry leader. Additionally, this delivery model supports our principle of “Compliance by Design”, enabling clients to maintain compliance globally. We believe the combination of our deep market expertise from our sales and support combined with the flexibility of our proprietary technology platform enable us to deliver industry-relevant, highly specialized solutions to our clients in a scalable manner, driving growth and differentiating us from our competitors. This has allowed us to develop long-standing relationships and a highly trusted brand with our clients as evidenced by the average tenure of our top 100 clients, based on 2021 and 2022 total revenue, at nine years, our average client net promoter score (“NPS”) of greater than 50 and a gross retention rate of 96% for 2021 and 2022.
Throughout our more than 45-year operating history, innovation and self-disruption have been at the core of what we do every day. Our history of unique, industry-oriented market insights allows us to be at the forefront of innovation which includes multiple industry-leading solutions. For example, we pioneered criminal fulfillment technology (CourtDirect), arrest record and incarceration alert products, post-hire monitoring capabilities, AI-enhanced record review and validation process and the industry’s only proprietary technology in a single-sourced U.S.-nationwide fingerprint network. Our commitment to innovation has continued with the recent development of enhanced global language support capabilities, a cloud-based operating platform, our exclusive partnership with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) serving as their fingerprint services provider, and a comprehensive global identity verification solution through our partnership with ID.me in the U.S. and with Yoti internationally. Enabled by our market leadership and platform investments, we have established a foundation and roadmap for future innovation which includes industry-specific products, growing our Identity-as-a-Service capabilities and further geographic expansion.
On September 27, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”), in which we and certain selling stockholders sold an aggregate of 16,427,750 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, consisting of 4,760,000 newly issued shares that we sold, 9,525,000 secondary shares that the selling stockholders sold and 2,142,750 shares that the selling stockholders sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares at an offering price of $23.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $94.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of $6.8 million and offering expenses of $8.1 million, of which $0.2 million was unpaid as of December 31, 2021. On November 1, 2021, we utilized proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand to repay $100.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our term loan (the “First Lien Term Loan”). 
On November 30, 2021, we acquired Employment Background Investigations, Inc. (“EBI”) for a purchase price of $67.8 million, consisting of $66.3 million of cash and $1.5 million of contingent consideration recorded at fair value. EBI provides background screening, drug testing, occupational healthcare and electronic Form I-9 solutions for today’s talent acquisition and workforce management needs. This acquisition expanded our presence in key U.S. Verticals, including financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing and transportation.
On November 23, 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our shares of common stock over a period through December 31, 2024. The program is expected to be funded through our existing cash and future free cash flow. The share repurchase program is being executed on a discretionary basis through open market repurchases, private transactions or other transactions, including through block trades and Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 939,417 shares for approximately $14.0 million.
On November 29, 2022, we completed the refinancing of our existing credit facilities with new credit facilities comprised of a $300.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement (as defined in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facility”) extended our debt maturity profile to November 2027, increased our credit capacity, and is expected to reduce our annual interest expense. On February 28, 2023, we entered into an amortizing $300.0 million notional value interest rate swap. The notional value steps down from $300.0 million to $150.0 million on February 27, 2026. The swap provides for us to pay, as applied to the notional value, a fixed rate of interest of 4.26% monthly and receive, on a monthly basis, an amount equal to the greater of the one-month term SOFR and a floor of (0.10%), as applied to the notional value (the “Floating Leg”). The interest rate swap matures on November 29, 2027. The interest expense related to the 2022 Credit Agreement will be offset by proceeds received from the Floating Leg of the interest rate swap. 
In January 2023, we expanded our global presence into Latin America through the acquisition of Socrates Limited and its affiliates (‘Socrates”), the largest independent screening company in Latin America. The acquisition will allow us to better serve the rapidly growing regional hiring needs of both multi-national and local clients in a region with rapidly increasing hiring demands.
On March 1, 2023, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of A-Check Global, a U.S.-based employment screening organization, providing us access to a high quality, enterprise-focused customer base diversified across attractive verticals including healthcare and telecom.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, our revenues were $454.1 million, $641.9 million and $766.8 million, respectively. Our net losses were $52.3 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and our net income was $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We recorded an operating loss of $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and operating income of $0.4 million and $59.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, our Adjusted EBITDA was $99.8 million, $179.2 million and $198.5 million, respectively, and our Adjusted Net Income was $26.7 million, $92.2 million and $106.5 million, respectively. For the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income and a reconciliation to net income, their most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Our Market Opportunity
The global background and identity verification market in which we operate is large, growing and highly fragmented representing a $18 billion total addressable market as of 2021, which is expected to grow at a 12% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) to $33 billion in 2026. The total addressable market comprises three distinct components as follows: the $6 billion global pre-hire employment screening services market (source: Acclaro Growth Partners (“Acclaro”), July 2021), expected to grow at a 6% CAGR to $9 billion in 2026, the $3 billion global post-hire employment screening services market (source: Acclaro, July 2021), expected to grow at a 12% CAGR to $5 billion in 2026, as well as the $9 billion global identity verification market (source: MarketsandMarkets, December 2021), expected to grow at a 17% CAGR to $19 billion in 2026.
Our addressable market is rapidly evolving and benefits from a number of key demand drivers, many of which increase the need for more flexible, comprehensive screening and hiring solutions, including the following:
•Growing participation in the gig economy and contingent workforce
The gig economy and contingent workforce consists of independent contractors, online platform workers, contract firm workers and contingent workers. According to Upwork’s 2022 Freelance Forward survey, 39% of the U.S. workforce performed freelance work during 2022, an increase over 2021’s 36% rate, and this proportion is expected to increase. Amongst Gen-Z and millennials, the share of workers who participated in freelance work are even higher at 43% and 46%, respectively. The rise and expansion of the gig economy and contingent workforce results in a greater portion of the workforce being sourced from temporary or on-demand labor pools. Additionally, the rise of competing gig platforms has made it easier for gig workers to shift between platforms, thus increasing the demand for screening. As the gig economy caters to clients in a very direct and personal way (e.g., rideshare, goods delivery, household services) and large corporations continue to increase utilization of a contingent workforce that may access sensitive information, safe and effective background screening capabilities have become critical. We believe that continued growth in the gig and contingent workforce model for the foreseeable future will support clear demand for Sterling’s deep expertise and tailored solutions.
•Elevated voluntary employee churn
Generational and structural shifts in the workforce have led to elevated levels of voluntary employee churn, particularly with younger workers. Members of the millennial and Gen-Z generations switch jobs more frequently than previous generations. According to a December 2022 LinkedIn study, 61% of American workers are considering leaving their jobs in 2023. Among Gen-Z workers, 72% are considering quitting, as are 66% of millennials. Moreover, the generational movement away from unions and defined benefit plans reduces contractual and financial incentives to stay in a particular role, reducing switching costs for employees. The ongoing structural shift from in-office to remote work further reduces the historical geographic matching challenge employers and employees faced, further reducing switching costs for employees and expanding talent pools for employers. These trends support increasing demand for global, fast and efficient employment screening and identity verification services that only providers of scale, like Sterling, can sufficiently address.
•The rise of fraudulent job applications and growing spotlight on a company’s reputational risk
False claims within job applications are a growing concern for employers. According to a 2023 ResumeBuilder.com study, 72% of Americans admit to lying on their resumes, with education and years 
of experience being the top two areas of falsification. False claims by candidates can put an organization at significant risk. Costs include not only salary but also incentives, benefits, recruiting expenses, administrative costs and the cost to restart the process in recruiting a candidate. In extreme cases, the employee may cause harm in the workplace, leading to a claim of negligent hiring, forcing the employer to contend with the cost and time of litigation and possible significant damages or settlements. Additionally, there may be considerable reputational risk to the employer, whose safety and trust may be called into question. Utilizing background and identification verification services helps organizations to mitigate these risks.
•Proliferation of personal data driving need for identity verification
According to a 2022 report by the Federal Trade Commission, the total number of fraud and identity thefts in 2021 was 5.7 million, an almost 18% increase compared to 2020 (4.9 million). In addition, according to a recent Risk Based Security report, the top two data types exposed in breaches were names (63.9%) and Social Security numbers (40.6%). This growth in exposed identities, especially names and social security numbers, puts more identities at risk of theft. Verifying identity is a powerful tool that employers can use to help ensure that their candidates and workers are who they claim to be and that fraudulent data is not used during the hiring and onboarding process. 
•Increase in background screening adoption outside the U.S.
We believe that pre-hire candidate screening is significantly less common outside of the U.S. Many international markets are beginning to view employment background checks as a critical component of their hiring functions. Additionally, the international expansion of U.S.-based global companies and their desire to offer centralized and comparable hiring practices has introduced the benefits of background screening to foreign markets. For these employers, global background checks are critical in order to comply with regulatory requirements, standardize their quality of hires and protect against negligent hiring risks. However, international background checks or verifying foreign credentials presents additional complexities, as employers may not be familiar with foreign customs or information sources, and the time and cost to hire employees with international histories are often much more significant. Background and identity verification service firms that can navigate these international challenges present a clear advantage for employers.
•Increase in continuous monitoring or post-hire screening processes
While some industries have regulatory requirements for post-hire screening, employers from all industries are increasingly focused on managing risk in the workplace through continuous screening and monitoring. According to a 2021 report by the Professional Background Screening Association (“PBSA”), 19% of organizations worldwide conduct background checks on a recurring basis in addition to during the initial hiring/onboarding process. Continuous screening allows for greater mobility and safety for remote, onsite and contingent jobs, with monitoring solutions such as screening for healthcare sanctions, medical licenses, motor vehicle registration monitoring and social media monitoring helping ensure compliance with on-going certification and licensing requirements as well as prompting risk warnings on any changes to an employee’s profile, including any criminal activity, drug use or health changes, amongst others.
•Increasing regulatory, compliance and risk management requirements
Increasing regulation is creating a heightened and complex risk of potential liabilities related to hiring and workforce management that is increasingly difficult for employers to manage. U.S. employee privacy and data protection laws are complicated and vary state-to-state. In addition, the interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) is continuously evolving. Other complexities include variations in drug testing laws by industry and state and the introduction of “ban the box” and “fair chance” laws at the local, state, and federal level, which limit an employer’s ability to inquire about criminal histories and to consider them in making employment decisions. Outside the U.S., the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) introduced significant changes in the way personal data is protected and handled in the European Union (the “EU”). In response, organizations are increasing their focus on compliance functions to ensure they meet these evolving legal and regulatory requirements, often turning to outsourced service providers. As they do, large service providers like Sterling with the depth and experience to help companies navigate these intricacies will continue to benefit from the increase in regulatory complexity.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we differentiate ourselves through the following key competitive strengths:
•A market leader with significant scale and breadth. We are a leading global provider of technology-enabled background and identity verification services across a wide array of industries and geographies—completing 110 million searches across over 240 countries and territories in 35 languages for over 50,000 highly-diversified clients during the year ended December 31, 2022. We are a market leader in the U.S., Canada and many markets throughout the world, including within Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia Pacific (“APAC”) and Latin America. Our global fulfillment capabilities are supported by operations in 16 jurisdictions—the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K. We believe this differentiates Sterling with large, marquee clients who demand sophisticated solutions across broad enterprises with nuanced operating priorities.
•Award-winning, proprietary technology platform and extensive global product suite.
We believe our proprietary technology platform and global product suite provide us with a number of competitive advantages, including the following:
Proprietary Technology and Analytics Platform: We operate a global cloud-based platform, purpose-built to address the unique needs of our clients. With over 95% of our revenue processed through platforms in the cloud, our technology platform is scalable to serve our global client base and flexible to adapt to changing dynamics within industries. We deliver a seamless user experience—our mobile-friendly client and candidate interfaces (Sterling Client Hub, Sterling Candidate Hub and Sterling Analytics Hub) are intuitive and easy-to-use. Our customizable, powerful data analytics platform provides clients with the information they need to gain real-time insights and make data-driven decisions as they seek to manage, streamline and optimize their programs. Our proprietary fulfillment platform technologically sets us apart in our ability to manage the complexities of background screening. Sterling’s fulfillment platform is AI-driven and augmented with RPA, which results in high accuracy, low hiring costs and low time-to-hire rates, with over 70% of U.S. criminal searches completed within the first hour and 90% within the first day. Integrated clients represent a growing share of our business, with over 60% of revenue now integrated. We expect this percentage to continue to increase as adoption of ATS and HCM software solutions grows. We have developed a comprehensive integration platform by partnering with many of the leading HCM and ATS platforms. Those clients with third-party HCM and ATS systems may integrate with Sterling through one of our over 75 platform integrations. Gig economy, contingent workforce and enterprise clients, who utilize proprietary candidate workflow systems, may integrate into Sterling’s platform by leveraging our well-documented public RESTful API. This API provides clients with access to Sterling’s powerful services along with a wide range of capabilities, customization options and mobility solutions. All of our platform integrations create opportunities for our clients to improve productivity and profitability, and in turn create stickier client relationships for Sterling. We believe that these proprietary systems cannot be easily replicated without substantial investment.
Global Product Suite: We offer an extensive suite of global products addressing a wide range of complex client needs. Our solutions include identity verification, comprehensive background screening, credential verification, drug and health screening, processing of employee documentation required for onboarding and ongoing risk monitoring. Sterling’s background screening solutions utilize proprietary automation technology that we believe delivers thorough, fast and accurate records with global criminal screening capabilities in over 240 countries and territories. Our credential verification services are backed by our proprietary fulfillment engine. We provide comprehensive drug and health screenings with access to approximately 20,000 collection sites supporting the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (“SAMHSA”) in the U.S. Sterling provides onboarding document management services as well as ongoing workforce and medical license monitoring. We believe our global product suite positions us well to access a broader set of clients and future revenue and growth opportunities.
Identity Workflow Solutions: We believe we offer one of the most complete full-stack identity workflow technologies, which allows our clients to verify a candidate’s identity before starting a background check. With more work shifting remote, the growth of gig economy contract work and an increasing use of the contingent workforce, the need for pre-verified identity during the pre-employment process continues to grow. Our full suite of identity solutions includes telecom and device verification, document verification, facial recognition, biometric matching and video chat identity proofing. In addition to online identity verification, we have proprietary technology in a single-sourced national network of fingerprint collection sites across all 50 U.S. states, where we can capture and use multiple sets of biometrics in a single visit using internally developed innovative hardware and software, which can be integrated with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the “FBI”), FINRA and other screening processes. We believe our identity solutions add demonstrable value to clients and candidates, and we are well-positioned to benefit as the market adopts identity verification as part of background screening.
•Highly diversified and long-tenured client base. Our deep insight into the industries and geographies we serve through more than 45 years of experience has allowed us to develop a client base that is diversified across size, industry and geography with minimal concentration. This is enabled by our deep market expertise and our delivery model where we have verticalized around specific industries and geographic markets. This go-to-market approach creates a cycle of innovation, product development, benchmarking and consultative best-practices. We currently serve over 50,000 clients, including over 50% of the Fortune 100 and over 50% of the Fortune 500. Our gross retention rate for 2021 and 2022 was 96%. In 2022, no single client accounted for more than 3% of our revenue and our top 25 clients accounted for less than 25% of our revenue. The average relationship for our top 100 clients, based on 2021 and 2022 total revenue, is nine years and growing. These metrics reflect how deeply embedded we are in our clients’ daily human resources (“HR”) and compliance workflows. We are well diversified across healthcare, the gig economy, financial and business services, industrials, retail, contingent, technology, media and entertainment, transportation and logistics, hospitality, education and government industries. As the complexity and nuances of acquiring talent increases for organizations, we believe we are well-positioned to grow with our clients.
•Attractive financial profile. We have an attractive business model underpinned by recurring revenues, significant operating leverage and low capital requirements that contribute to strong free cash flow. A majority of our U.S. enterprise client contracts are exclusive to Sterling or require Sterling to be used as the primary provider. Additionally, they are typically multi-year agreements with automatic renewal terms, no termination for convenience clauses and set pricing with Sterling’s right to increase prices at certain intervals including the ability to increase pass-through costs to our clients with 30 days notice. The strength of our contract terms combined with our high levels of client retention results in a high degree of revenue visibility. The vast majority of our revenues are either recurring or re-occurring in nature. While we experienced year-over-year revenue declines in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to base revenue moderation caused by macroeconomic uncertainty, we have otherwise shown consistency in our execution, with our organic revenues growing by double digits year-over-year in seven out of the eight quarters of 2021 and 2022. We have driven these results by deploying strategies and tactics focused on winning new business, driving up-sell and cross-sell, and increasing our gross retention rate. In the eight quarters of 2021 and 2022, when our total Company average revenue growth was 32% per quarter, our average revenue growth from the combination of new business, up-sell and cross-sell, net of attrition, was 14% per quarter. Additionally, we benefit from natural operating leverage, utilizing our robust automation processes that result in attractive contribution margins associated with incremental revenue generated from our solutions. Our capital requirements remain minimal with capital expenditures (including capitalized software development costs and exclusive of acquisitions) of 3.0% of revenues in 2021 and 2.6% of revenues in 2022. We incurred net losses of $52.3 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and generated net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $19.4 million. Although we incurred net losses during 2020 and 2021, we continued to generate strong free cash flow, allowing us the financial flexibility to invest in the business and pursue growth through acquisitions.
•Experienced management team with depth of experience and track record of success. Our senior management team has a track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve and technology-enabled businesses, with 90% of our senior management team being new or in new roles since 2018. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Josh Peirez, has extensive strategy, product and operational experience and plays an instrumental role in driving Sterling toward our global vision. Our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Peter Walker, has over 10 years of experience as a CFO with global expertise in finance, strategy, M&A and risk management and leads the finance organization, investor relations and all aspects of financial management and reporting. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Lou Paglia, leads global operations and is responsible for driving revenue growth, delivering client service, and ensuring our services meet the evolving market needs. We also maintain a strong core of business leaders dedicated to specific Verticals and Regions that leverage substantial experience across the background screening, risk management and information services industries. We believe this management team is well positioned to lead our business into the future. 
Growth Strategy
We intend to capitalize on our attractive market opportunity by continuing to execute across the following key revenue and profit growth strategies:
•Expand existing client relationships. Our substantial base of over 50,000 existing clients presents a significant opportunity to increase adoption of new services. Since 2019, over 50% of new clients in the U.S. have contracted for more than one product line, which demonstrates our ability to grow within our client base. We have implemented rigorous client success programs to better anticipate our clients’ needs and identify appropriate solutions. For example, we conduct quarterly business reviews with our enterprise clients, where we review program performance, client needs, industry trends and potential enhancement opportunities. Through this collaborative approach, we cultivate long-term client relationships primed for adoption of new services. Further, we are seeing global clients that use different providers in different geographies consolidate into one platform, and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
•Win new clients. We have an established track record of new client wins and believe there is substantial opportunity to further grow our client base. Operating in a large and highly fragmented addressable market, we win against both large and small competitors due to our deep market expertise from our sales and support verticalization combined with the flexibility of our proprietary technology platform. This combination enables us to deliver industry-relevant, highly specialized solutions to our clients in a scalable manner, driving profitable growth and differentiating us from our competitors. Our size and scale positions us to serve enterprise organizations well. We believe that many competitors, especially smaller ones, will continue to be challenged in meeting enterprise client needs, including sophisticated and flexible platforms, global capabilities and the ability to handle large volumes, complex programs and varying compliance requirements. Our differentiated product and service offerings, platform capabilities, and go-to-market strategy have resulted in significant new business momentum, with growth from new business of 12% in 2021 and 9% in 2022.
•Grow Identity-as-a-Service offering. Based upon our more than 45 years of industry experience, we believe that most background screening companies in the U.S. do not typically check identities or verify candidate-provided biographical data—two things that are critical for a successful background check. When clients select Sterling’s comprehensive and fully customizable identity verification solution, candidates are guided through a simple process that verifies their identity, supported by our exclusive partnership with ID.me. All relevant biographic data is then automatically imported, with the candidate’s consent, into Sterling Candidate Hub and used to initiate the background check, resulting in greater accuracy and reduced fraud. We believe that the strong value proposition for clients coupled with the strength of Sterling’s offering will make Identity-as-a-Service a key contributor to our success in expanding existing client relationships and winning new clients. Outside of the U.S., we expect our workflow partnership with U.K.-based Yoti to expand our digital identity solutions to international markets by building on the same vision and best-in-class identity verification offerings we have in place in the U.S. with ID.me.
•Introduce new products and penetrate adjacent markets. We have a robust new product roadmap. Project Ignite has enabled us to launch products rapidly to meet immediate client needs, as we did in 2022 when we developed our robust and proprietary core I-9 offering into a fully integrated I-9 solution within our Sterling platform and partner ecosystem. In 2022, we also strengthened our competitive differentiation through the expansion of our identity capabilities in both the U.S. and the U.K. In the U.S., with ID.me, we believe that we became the only background screening provider to have a fully integrated reusable identity workflow within the screening process, furthering our leadership position to deliver identity services for employers in the U.S. In the U.K., we became the first background screening organization to become a certified digital identity service provider and have partnered with Yoti to develop a comprehensive global identity verification solution. This new capability enables a faster and easier experience for prospective talent in the U.K. to verify themselves using modern technology while reducing the chance of identity fraud. We intend to continue to invest in developing industry-first solutions, further innovating in our existing Verticals and Regions as well as pursuing adjacent market opportunities that leverage our existing technology platform. For example, our digital wallet credentials solution is being designed to provide candidates with a user-centric, verified profile to prove their identity and share verified credentials with employers. We anticipate this solution will provide us with a new opportunity to monetize our services and the ability to further penetrate the business-to-consumer (“B2C”) market. Another product innovation is the continued enhancement of post-hire monitoring solutions, which monitor, among other things, healthcare sanctions, medical licenses, recent arrests, motor vehicle registrations and social media. Lastly, we plan to pursue new or underpenetrated adjacent market opportunities including talent assessment, reference checking, onboarding and investigative due diligence.
•Pursue further geographic expansion. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $76.7 million, or 17%, of Sterling revenue was generated outside of the U.S. compared to $119.2 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $123.0 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 
slight decrease during 2022 is partially attributable to our 2021 acquisition of U.S.-based EBI and strong growth in the U.S. We see compelling opportunities to extend our operating presence in other geographies and unify the global experience for clients as our international business continues to expand profitably, benefiting from operating leverage due to investments made in a global technology infrastructure and global fulfillment. We expect continued adoption of outsourced background screening outside the U.S. and are well positioned to benefit from this trend. We continue to introduce innovative region-specific products to best meet the needs of clients within each geography. We believe we have a unique ability to translate client needs into superior local market solutions through a combination of portfolio depth and breadth, local know-how and language capabilities. In EMEA, we continue to be a market leader in the U.K., with particular strength with financial services and gig companies. In parallel, we are growing our presence across the region with particular focus in continental Europe and the Middle East. To facilitate this expansion, we continue to expand the impact of our global multilingual hub in Poland. We entered the APAC market through two acquisitions and have continued to drive growth organically in both established and emerging screening markets, with more than 20% revenue growth in 2022 in this region and particular strength with financial services companies. In Canada, where revenue continued to grow in 2022, we have a strong position in small- and medium-sized businesses and are focused on the significant opportunity to serve more of the Canadian operations of our U.S. clients with our unified global platform. In January 2023, we expanded our global presence into Latin America through the acquisition of Socrates, the largest independent screening company in Latin America. The acquisition will allow us to better serve the rapidly growing regional hiring needs of both multi-national and local clients in a region with rapidly increasing hiring demands. 
•Leverage proprietary data. With over 45 years of industry experience, we have the know-how to obtain data from robust and trusted sources, access to historical data and the resources to put data to work. We will explore opportunities to develop, augment, and acquire proprietary data sets that could be used to fuel our existing core business and create new opportunities in a multitude of ways, including: improving speed and the quality of our services; creating cost efficiencies, industry benchmarks, and client program recommendations and optimizations; and building unique products.
•Pursue strategic M&A. We view a targeted, disciplined approach to strategic mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) as highly complementary to our other key growth objectives, compounding and/or accelerating related opportunities. Historically, Sterling has successfully identified, acquired and integrated several businesses that broaden and enhance our suite of client solutions and geographic presence. We will continue to execute a rigorous framework for building an actionable pipeline of acquisitions, with a focus on both (i) strategic benefits such as depth and breadth of capabilities, regional presence, and end market exposure and (ii) tangible opportunities to generate synergies and strong financial returns on capital deployed. As part of this targeted growth strategy, we are focused on acquiring targets that (i) are U.S. tuck-ins, (ii) provide us with increased scale in existing international markets, or (iii) expand us into new geographies. With hundreds of smaller competitors in our space, we see M&A as a strategic opportunity to increase market share while realizing synergies. Through our investments in technology, we have established a unified platform, allowing us to quickly integrate targets and drive synergies. We expect Sterling’s proven track record of M&A—with 10 acquisitions over the last 11 years—to continue to support and elevate the various layers of our future growth profile.
Our Technology and Operating Platform
Our product portfolio is enabled by a core set of cloud-based, proprietary technology tools that provide access to court records, expedite workflows, and deliver highly accurate results. The outputs of these technology tools are seamlessly integrated into our client and candidate interfaces and our clients’ HCM systems enabling a simple, fast and unified candidate hiring experience. These systems cannot easily be replicated and have enabled Sterling to boast some of the fastest turnaround times in the industry, while maintaining the quality our clients expect.
In early 2019, we launched Project Ignite, a three-phase strategic investment initiative, to create a cloud-native enterprise-class global platform with best-in-class user experiences and product capabilities. This initiative has enabled us to deliver a new client experience with enhanced analytics and dashboard tools; a streamlined, mobile-first, and localized candidate experience; movement of platforms processing over 95% of our revenue in the cloud; new product innovations; increased automation for improved efficiency, turnaround time and quality; and an improved security environment. We continue to benefit from these enhancements through new business wins and improved client retention. Over the long term, we expect these investments will continue to enhance our margins, improve time to market—as we build once and deploy globally—and allow us to increase innovation.
Client and Candidate Interfaces
At the center of the Sterling background screening experience are our Sterling Candidate Hub, Sterling Client Hub and Sterling Analytics Hub, each purpose-built to meet the needs of specific end users.
•Sterling Candidate Hub. Sterling Candidate Hub, launched in 2019, was built with today’s candidate in mind from start to finish. Our background, identity and compliance services sit between the recruiting and employee onboarding stages within a company’s employee lifecycle. As such, Sterling Candidate Hub is one of the first interactions candidates have with our clients; we have heard time and again from clients how important these initial interactions are, as they set the tone with new employees. Positive first impressions can lead to improved job acceptance rates, employee satisfaction and productivity. In response to these needs, we have developed an intuitive, frictionless and mobile-first candidate experience. Sterling Candidate Hub provides a streamlined process for candidates to interact with Sterling and manage their entire screening process. The platform allows candidates the flexibility to provide information from any device in multiple languages and allows them to save time with mobile document uploads and e-signature capabilities. The platform is intelligent, so as to customize the information requested based on the specific package of services ordered; this means candidates need not waste time providing extraneous information. Progress is managed through text notifications and reminders.
•Sterling Client Hub. No two clients are the same, but all demand a powerful yet easy to use platform. This is why we purpose-built our cloud-based, proprietary technology client platform, Sterling Client Hub, in 2020. Sterling Client Hub consolidates candidate orders and data into a single, unified workflow, allowing clients to easily place orders, manage tasks, monitor statuses and view consumer reports. Its mobile responsive design stands apart from more cumbersome competitor platforms. Results are easy-to-read with intuitive results display and collapsible/expandable search details. The platform is flexible by design to allow clients the ability to configure permissions, access control by role, invitation and task workflows, packages and adjudication rules. Single-sign-on capabilities allow enterprise clients the ability to manage their programs consistent with security best practices. Sterling Client Hub is highly secure, designed to be easily augmented with new services and regularly updated to meet evolving compliance standards. All this enables our clients to manage complex screening programs with ease while reducing time-to-hire.
•Sterling Analytics Hub. The currency of data and value of data-driven insights to clients, especially to program managers, is of paramount importance. Our Sterling Analytics Hub provides clients with a customizable, powerful data analytics platform to display a comprehensive view of their screening programs. Our robust suite of dashboards provides clients with the information they need to gain better insights and to make data-driven decisions as they seek to manage, streamline and optimize their programs. The Sterling Analytics Hub puts comprehensive program management one click away, while providing drill down capabilities and underlying data.
Platform Integrations
We believe we have one of the most integrated platforms in our industry as evidenced by our over 75 integrations with leading providers in the HCM and ATS ecosystem as well as our robust Sterling Gig API capabilities. Over 60% of our revenue is generated from integrated clients.
Our integration capabilities allow clients to benefit from improved productivity and profitability, streamlined candidate experiences and reduction in user-based errors and subsequent candidate disputes. Sterling benefits by increasing the stickiness of clients, reducing potential relationship friction from user-based errors and harvesting leads from our strong referral partnerships.
•Sterling Integration Hub. Our services can be directly integrated into our clients’ proprietary workflows through one of our more than 75 platform integrations, further streamlining our clients’ HR processes and improving candidate experiences, while creating a stickier client relationship. We have developed a robust partner ecosystem with industry-leading HCM system providers such as Oracle, SAP SuccessFactors, Workday Recruiting and Ultimate Kronos Group, among others. The Sterling Integration Hub middleware is proprietary and easily configurable to meet the needs of most corporate HR systems. Unlike many of our competitors, we are not dependent on third-party middleware, which gives us both the flexibility and the ability to customize to the needs of the market and control our own roadmap. We deliver secure, partner-ready integration solutions that are built to scale to any size business.
•Sterling Gig API. Sterling offers a well-documented public RESTful API. Our API enables gig economy and enterprise companies to easily integrate their own applications into Sterling’s platform. It provides a wide range of capabilities, customization options and mobility solutions out of the box, which means that implementation will not detract from core product development. We are seeing this flexible API used with greater frequency where traditional HR based integration methods, like HRXML, have previously been used. In addition, this API opens up a multitude of use cases where Sterling can easily integrate into client and partner workflow applications.
Fulfillment Technology
Since Sterling launched one of the industry’s first automated criminal record fulfillment platforms, CourtDirect, in 2006, we have been at the forefront of leveraging technology to improve service fulfillment. We have continually invested, innovated and iterated on our fulfillment technology and data acquisition for over 15 years. In total, our investments make it difficult for a competitor to replicate our global fulfillment systems without substantial investment. Our fulfillment platform leverages over 3,300 proprietary and AI-driven automation integrations, including APIs and RPA bots, which enables 90% of our U.S. criminal searches to be automated and allows us to complete 50% of U.S. criminal searches within the first five minutes, 65% of U.S. criminal searches within the first 15 minutes, over 70% of U.S. criminal searches within the first hour and 90% within the first day. Our automation provides a significant competitive advantage and margin enhancement opportunity that can be deployed to other areas of Sterling, including account setup, procurement and financial reporting.
Our well-developed fulfillment technology highlights the resiliency of our business model under even extreme conditions, providing clients with ease-of-mind and allowing them to focus on their own businesses. For example, Sterling’s technologically enhanced fulfillment allowed us to fulfill searches in at least 98% of U.S. jurisdictions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while we believe certain competitors struggled to operate.
Historical investments in CourtDirect, AI SmartData and Verifications Portal technologies not only reduce costs for Sterling and our clients, but also lead to improvements in speed, quality and compliance.
•CourtDirect Technology. Underpinning Sterling’s U.S. criminal searches is our third generation of CourtDirect, our proprietary criminal records delivery system. This technology automates a historically manual and time-consuming process by integrating with jurisdictions throughout the U.S. With access to millions of criminal records, CourtDirect provides faster turnaround times while decreasing human data entry errors. Because CourtDirect is our proprietary technology, we use vendors to retrieve county court records on a limited basis, unlike many of our competitors. In jurisdictions where automation is not possible or practical, we seek to hire our own court runners rather than rely exclusively on third-party vendors. This gives us greater control over our supply chain and the ability to achieve faster turnaround times on average.
•AI SmartData Technology. Where CourtDirect performs automated criminal record search and retrieval, our proprietary AI SmartData technology automates Sterling’s criminal record review processes, thus eliminating manual steps so that services can be completed quickly and efficiently. The technology starts by ensuring that returned criminal records can be positively attributed to the specific candidate being searched using our proprietary AI matching algorithms. The technology then standardizes criminal charges, conviction codes and disposition codes among the thousands of courts within the U.S., after which it applies U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations to the standardized records. Through years of work, we have been able to standardize over 750,000 permutations of state, charge and disposition combinations. The standardization work that AI SmartData performs also allows us to administer a clients’ customized adjudication matrix at their direction more easily. With AI SmartData all of this is done without human intervention, resulting in reduced human error, increased accuracy and shorter turnaround times. For example, we noted an approximately 50% reduction in turnaround times following the adoption of AI SmartData to Sterling’s criminal record review process. Currently over 50% of our potential criminal record reporting volume is auto-closed using the technology; where required, Sterling’s experienced team members perform the record review processes. Unlike an outsourced AI solution that some competitors use, Sterling has full control to make changes quickly in response to client needs, changes in laws and regulations, or simply for enhancements based upon our own review.
•Verifications Portal. Our Verifications Portal is a proprietary fulfillment platform that delivers increased efficiencies, higher productivity, improved quality and faster turnaround times for our clients. The Verifications Portal’s functionality removes the need for manual work assignment by queuing up the next available work for a Sterling verifier based on the employee’s skillset. Additionally, it leverages algorithms to intelligently group and map work. For example, the Verification Portal can group verifications from a particular employer and assign them to a single agent so that outreach to said 
employer is optimized. It uses automation to allow Sterling to highly customize our clients’ credential verification programs without sacrificing productivity, speed or accuracy. The Verifications Portal is used in conjunction with direct APIs to our vendor partners and our proprietary Verifications Contact Database that tracks known entities and their preferred mode of fulfillment, decreasing the verifier’s research time. This database is a proprietary asset compiled over many years and updated daily, providing a strong competitive advantage in enabling Sterling to fulfill verifications more efficiently.
Global Operations
Supplementing our fulfillment technology is an experienced, resilient and global operations team that partners with our Vertical and Region teams to provide exceptional quality, consistent delivery and customization capabilities for our clients. Sterling utilizes an in-house offshore strategy rather than relying on third-party outsource partners, which many of our competitors utilize. The benefits of leveraging an in-house global operations team strategy include rigorous oversight of quality control, enhanced speed of execution, a broad and diverse talent pool, economies of scale and attractive labor costs; resulting in a unified, knowledgeable employee base that is dedicated to Sterling’s mission and our clients’ experience.
Today, the operations team is located across 13 countries—U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore and the U.K.—with, what we believe is, the industry’s first offshore captive fulfillment center launched in India in 2006. This allows us to be nimble in scaling geographically to support incremental volumes and also provide country and regional specialization to meet our clients’ needs. Additionally, the geographically diverse footprint of the operations team supports our business continuity plan, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic when we flexed work across geographies as needed.
We have multiple initiatives underway to further reduce our turnaround times, improve our margins and further enhance client experiences. First, we continually leverage process reengineering to improve quality and efficiency. Second, through technology investments as part of Project Ignite, we intend to extend the success we’ve seen with RPA in our U.S. criminal fulfillment processes to our other product lines, including verifications, drug and health and non-U.S. criminal screening. In addition, by consolidating clients onto our single global platform in phase three of Project Ignite, we are able to drive greater efficiency within our operations teams and to better manage resources through seasonal and unexpected demand spikes. At the end of 2022, we also launched Project Nucleus which we expect to drive meaningful cost savings and efficiency gains. The goal of this initiative is to enhance our organization by re-engineering processes, driving fulfillment labor cost reductions and identifying and executing on additional automation opportunities.
Our Suite of Services
Identity Verification
Sterling’s identity verification services provide our clients with real-time information about a candidate to help validate and verify who they are hiring before they begin a background check. With the continued movement toward remote work, the prevalence of digitized identification information and increase in data breaches, there is an ever-growing risk that a candidate may be using a stolen identity when applying for a job and completing a background check. Our comprehensive set of solutions helps clients to mitigate that risk through the following services:
•Online Identity-as-a-Service Suite. 
•In the U.S., Sterling’s exclusive partnership with ID.me provides us with an identity verification solution that is recognized as best-in-class and has been adopted by numerous U.S. federal agencies and states. Individuals get a reusable secure digital identity credential so they only go through identity verification once. Our online Identity-as-a-Service suite with ID.me is made up of five identity verification building blocks that are combined to meet a client’s unique required level of comfort, including meeting the U.S. federal National Institute of Standards and Technology 800-63 technical requirements for federal agencies and contractors implementing digital identity verification services. The building blocks are:
•Telecom and Device Verification: Verify that the SIM card in a mobile device is associated with the candidate’s identity. Evaluate the tenure of the account, device location and fraud history.
•Identification Document Verification: Scan, verify and parse document images using machine vision to extract content, leveraging a proprietary database of rules and AI to verify document authenticity. ID.me currently contains 100 million pre-verified identities within the database and is growing. 
•Facial Recognition with Biometric Matching: Match a government identity document to the candidate’s selfie image using advanced machine learning technologies. 
•Social Security Number Verification: Validate a candidate’s biographic information, such as name, address and other identifying information against credit bureau records.
•Live Video Chat Identification Proofing: As a failover option or upon client preference, we provide individuals the ability to complete identity proofing with a trained “Trusted Referee” via video conferencing. 
•Internationally, Sterling has partnered with Yoti to streamline background checks and expand its digital identity solutions. The global partnership is expanding our digital identity capabilities in EMEA, APAC, Canada and Latin America, accelerating our vision to create privacy-centric portable identities for candidates.
•The partnership will enable a digital identity verification workflow to be integrated directly into the hiring process, allowing employers to take an identity-first approach, where a candidate’s identity is verified before completing other background checks and before actually being hired.
•Candidates who verify their identity through Sterling and Yoti will be able to seamlessly create a secure, reusable digital identity. This will allow them to verify their identity once and share their details with other businesses in seconds, making the verification process more streamlined for employers and candidates. Individuals will be able to use their digital identity for future job opportunities, age verification and any process requiring identity verification. 
•Sterling clients and their candidates will be able to enjoy the unique experience in Sterling’s international regions with a phased rollout planned during 2023, and the first phase beginning in the U.K.

•Fingerprinting. We provide fingerprinting services through our proprietary technology in a single-sourced and convenient national network with locations in all 50 U.S. states. Our state-of-the-art digital fingerprint capture technology reduces rejection rates and speeds up processing for faster onboarding and we are certified with the FBI, FINRA, Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Agency for Healthcare Information to submit electronic fingerprints directly. In addition, FINRA has contracted with Sterling to be its exclusive fingerprint provider. Under this agreement, we process and submit fingerprints to the FBI for all broker-dealer firms and funding portals. 
Background Checks
Our background check solutions utilize proprietary automation technology that delivers more thorough, faster and accurate records. These solutions include:
•Criminal record checks. Within the U.S., there is no single source for criminal records; instead, records are stored at 3,500+ local and county courthouses as well as separate state and federal databases, making it time and cost prohibitive to search all jurisdictions. Sterling uses a four-step process to address the complexity of the U.S. court systems. First, we determine where to search to locate a candidate’s possible criminal records and under what potential names using some or all of (i) a social security number trace to determine the addresses where a candidate has lived and what aliases the candidate may have used, (ii) a search of a national criminal record database and (iii) an incarceration and bookings database. Second, we leverage our CourtDirect technology to search and review each primary source jurisdiction and review the records for completeness. Next, we utilize our AI SmartData technology to determine whether candidate data matches any court records, filter the records per compliance requirements and apply specific client instructed adjudication rules. Finally, we deliver the results in a consumer report. Collectively, these steps enable us to provide what we believe are among the quickest turnaround times—50% of U.S. criminal searches within the first five minutes, 65% of U.S. criminal searches within the first 15 minutes, over 70% of U.S. criminal searches within the first hour and 90% within the first day—and highest accuracy as well as automation for efficient and effective client experiences.
Outside the U.S., Sterling supports criminal record searches in over 240 countries and territories. A global workforce requires dynamic, in-depth background checks from an experienced provider. The trend toward more people traveling across international borders for work requires the ability to conduct background checks in multiple geographies and jurisdictions for a single candidate. Each country and territory may have its own set of criminal data availability and access restrictions. For most of Sterling’s searches, we have access to nationwide or local court records directly or through approved partners. Some geographies require local police clearance authorizations that are obtained by the candidates, which are then validated by Sterling. In geographies that do not allow for either nationwide or local court records retrieval or police clearance authorization, Sterling utilizes databases that aggregate records worldwide from governments, courts, regulatory and law enforcement agency sources to identify potential criminal activity.
•Sex offender registries. Within the U.S., Sterling searches through the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) National Sex Offender Public Website (“NSOPW”), which includes registered sex offenders in 49 U.S. states, U.S. territories, the District of Columbia and participating Indian tribes. Sex offender registry searches are critical to ensuring employees, especially those with direct access to consumers and vulnerable populations, do not have relevant records.
•Civil court records. Sterling searches U.S. county court and federal civil settlement records and equivalents in many other countries and territories based on where the candidate has lived that match our client’s needs and requirements. Our Civil Court Record Searches help make clients aware of potential threats and arm them with facts to make well-informed decisions on which candidates align best with their organization. Our search reveals details such as breach of contracts, civil judgments, lawsuits, paternity suits, domestic disputes, divorces and restraining orders.
•Motor vehicle and driving license records. Our Motor Vehicle Record (“MVR”) reporting includes license type and class, restrictions, expiration date, endorsements, suspensions or revocations, violations/tickets, accidents and Driving Under the Influence (“DUI”) or Driving While Intoxicated (“DWI”) violations. Within the U.S., many of our clients require compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and DOT regulations.
•Executive investigations. For clients who require a higher level of insight, our enhanced due diligence subsidiary, Sterling Diligence, provides executive-level due diligence and executive screening and global investigations. Our executive investigation services are trusted by Fortune 100 companies, as well as some of the world’s most prestigious law firms, accounting firms, professional service providers, financial institutions, and mergers and acquisitions specialists.
•Credit reports. Credit checks are often mandated for candidates with managerial, accounting, financial record or check-writing responsibilities, and our reports reveal unbiased insights into candidates’ financial trustworthiness.
•Liens, Judgments, Bankruptcies. Our liens, judgments and bankruptcies product checks a U.S. nationwide database to determine where a candidate may have relevant records. We then search the identified U.S. civil courts to confirm and validate the records prior to reporting. This search is often combined with a credit check.
•Social media searches. Social media background checks provide vital information that help employers minimize the risk of a bad hire. Sterling helps companies protect their brands by screening potential and current employees using publicly available online information. Our social media searches, the scope of which are determined by our clients, reduces risk with a solution that enhances ethical decision-making and compliance by proactively identifying behaviors such as bigotry, sexism and violence.
•Contingent Workforce Solution. Our contingent workforce solution allows clients to centrally and effectively manage their contingent worker program by quickly and easily onboarding new contractors, obtaining program and contractor level reporting and having candidates pay for their own screens if desired.
•Sanctions, risk and compliance checks. Sterling can search a variety of sanctions databases, including: the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, commonly referred to as a terrorist watch list; Office of Inspector General (“OIG”); List of Excluded Individuals/Entities; the System for Award Management (“SAM”); the Excluded Parties List System (“EPLS”); the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”); state exclusions, sanctions, debarment, and disciplinary actions against 
healthcare professionals and businesses lists; and a database of foreign government restriction, sanction and exclusion records.
Credential Verification
Our global verification services include the following:
•Employment verification. Verifies a candidate’s employment history and records with HR, payroll or third-party providers. Verification can cover periods of traditional employment, as well as temp agency assignments, military history, and periods of self-employment. An employment history can be supplemented with a gap assessment, wherein Sterling identifies and validates gaps in a candidate’s employment history.
•Education verification. Verifies a candidate’s education history and records with school registers or designated third-party providers at the collegiate, high school, GED and home-schooling levels.
•Credential verification. Verifies many types of licenses and credentials such as financial FINRA checks, nursing licenses, medical licenses and others.
•Professional reference checks. Verifies a candidate’s character and work proficiency. 
•Department of Transportation. Within the U.S., verifies employment with DOT-regulated companies. Verification confirms job title, start/end dates, reason for leaving, prior accidents, injuries and other DOT mandated information.
Drug and Health Screening
Our U.S. drug and health screening services offer comprehensive pre-and post-hire drug screening with access to an expansive collection network of approximately 20,000 test sites nationwide. We offer drug screening services designed to reduce turnaround times, increase efficiency and improve the overall candidate and client experiences. The convenience of end-to-end electronic processing, online scheduling and walk-in collection sites enable employees and candidates to access locations and times that work best for them. Our Medical Review Officer (“MRO”) partners are licensed physicians responsible for receiving and reviewing each laboratory result issued. In addition, we offer access to an array of occupational health screening and clinical services such as physicals, fit for duty exams, titers, vaccinations, and biometric services. 
Our commitment to client-centric innovation throughout our service lines led to the development of our fast-growing Clinical Services Concierge service. For those clients that require additional support to clinical services, this service can help relieve the stress of managing a complex drug and health screening program. We offer personalized candidate instruction through a dedicated clinical concierge professional who can provide candidates step-by-step assistance to lead them through the process, creating a more seamless process and ensuring candidates are able to start on the date planned. We can also tailor our testing and services to meet our clients’ unique business and compliance requirements including instant point-of-care tests, onsite testing options and random testing selection.
Onboarding
Our onboarding solutions include the following:
•Sterling I-9. With ever-changing U.S. regulations, many employers either complete Form I-9 incorrectly or continue to rely upon paper-and-pencil Form I-9 completion with onsite storage. Remote workplaces and telework create additional requirements and logistical challenges. Sterling’s in-house, fully digital I-9 solution, Sterling I-9, provides seamless integration with our full suite of screening and onboarding services. It provides a mobile-responsive experience for both clients and their candidates. Having an in-house solution, unlike many of our competitors, allows for deeper integrations into our clients’ workflows while enabling us to respond faster to client and market needs.
•Onboarding forms. Sterling’s offering eases the burden for clients of processing the employee documentation required for onboarding. Our offering includes standard tax withholding and Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) disclosure forms as well as client-designed custom onboarding forms. Our solution validates data upon entry and checks for skipped questions, thus reducing opportunities for mistakes.
Ongoing Monitoring
Employers across industries are increasingly focused on managing risk in the workplace beyond initial hire through continuous screening and monitoring. Our ongoing monitoring solutions within the U.S. include the following:
•Workforce monitoring. Our workforce monitoring solution provides tools for clients to mitigate risk and liability through near real-time alerts on employee potential criminal behavior, such as DUIs, assaults, fraud and theft.
•Medical license monitoring. Our medical licensing monitoring solution helps mitigate brand and regulatory risk by providing a more efficient way for clients to identify individuals whose valid medical licenses may no longer be valid.
•Motor vehicle records monitoring. Our MVR monitoring solution provides continuous driver monitoring, driver list management, real time reporting, on-demand MVRs and access to driver training. For certain industries (e.g. transportation and logistics, gig, etc.) driver risk management is a critical business issue affecting reputation, profitability and regulatory compliance.
Our Clients
We serve the background and identity verification services needs of more than 50,000 clients. Our client base is diversified in size of client and industry and includes over 50% of the Fortune 100 and over 50% of the Fortune 500. We have minimal client concentration with no client accounting for more than 3% of revenue, and our top 25 clients accounting for less than 25% of revenue. We serve the healthcare, gig, financial and business services, industrials, retail, contingent, technology, media and entertainment, transportation and logistics, hospitality, education and government industries. We employ an operating model organized by Vertical and Region that produces differentiated end-market insights and allows us to tailor solutions to meet the needs of each industry we serve.
Our client relationships are contractual in nature and typically have multiple year terms with no termination for convenience clauses. A majority of our U.S. enterprise client contracts are exclusive to Sterling or the client is required to use Sterling as their primary provider. Our success is driven by a competitive service offering of fast, reliable, and accurate screening information delivered on a cost-effective basis. Additionally, our offerings are tightly integrated with our clients’ ATSs and HCM systems, further cementing our services into our clients’ daily HR workflows. Taken together, these factors have yielded strong client relationships with an average tenure of nine years across our top 100 clients based on 2021 and 2022 total revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Sterling’s lead generation and sales organization is one of our defining differentiators in the market. A strong sales culture permeates our organization as nearly all senior members of the management team are active in seeking and winning new business. We sell our solutions through a direct sales team organized by Vertical and Region. Each Vertical and Region has dedicated product marketing personnel and budget. Sales representatives are then responsible for the end-to-end selling process, including discovery, demonstration, negotiation and closing. Our sales representatives are trained to take a consultative approach to the entire new business process in order to understand the specific challenges and industry-specific nuances faced by clients. Based on this research, they design a pursuit strategy and propose solutions tailored to the client’s needs. Sterling’s sales approach ensures that we keep the client and their needs at the center of our process. Each sales representative’s productivity is tracked toward individual quotas with performance measured and reported daily.
Additionally, Sterling utilizes professional services and client success teams, which are also aligned by Vertical and Region, that are responsible for seamless client onboarding, client retention and upselling opportunities. Our Vertical and Region teams partner with centralized shared services groups that provide certain critical processes, including sales cycle management, training, analytics, requests for proposals, marketing operations, brand and digital marketing, pricing, integrations support and client implementations. This provides clients with a smooth experience from prospecting through implementation and support. As of December 31, 2022, we have over 100 sales representatives and over 450 client success professionals.
Clients count on Sterling for thought leadership in how they design and optimize their programs. Our client partnership model builds on our Vertical and Region team approach to help clients meet their specific objectives.
Our People
Our award-winning culture enables us to attract and retain diverse talent from a variety of industries and innovative companies. Our mission is to provide the foundation of trust and safety that our clients need to create great environments for their most essential resource—people. We believe everyone has the right to feel safe. As an organization, we strive to build a culture around four core values:
•It’s all about the people. Our business is about helping people find the right people. We care deeply about colleagues, clients and their candidates. 
•The client is always in the room. We exist to help our clients build a foundation of trust and safety. We make decisions that are best for the clients, based on data and judgment, not ego and politics. 
•Deliver results, they matter. We play to win. We are smart, fast and driven. We take risks, make mistakes and learn from them. We deliver. 
•Start with trust and prove it every day. We trust each other and prove ourselves worthy of trust to our clients and colleagues every day. 
We are a virtual-first company with the majority of our global employees working remotely. We believe this approach allows us to attract talent wherever people choose to live and allows us to better support our employees as they strive to balance the needs of their work and personal lives. We believe strongly in investing in the development of our people throughout their time with us and in ensuring we have an inclusive environment that contributes to our high-performing teams globally.
•Talent Acquisition. As a virtual-first organization, we hire talented individuals who raise the bar at Sterling and align with our culture and values. We attract talent no matter where the talent resides rather than relying on local talent pools. We strive to have a diverse candidate slate and interview panel.
•Employee Engagement and Connections. We provide virtual activities for employees to connect, and we host regular town halls to ensure company goals, progress and values are shared throughout the organization. In 2022, we also launched “Sharing Our Stories” forums that offer an opportunity for employees to learn, gain insights and strengthen connections by engaging with Sterling leaders and colleagues on relevant topics.
•Talent Development and Learning. We have a strong focus on learning and development with access to thousands of online self-paced courses, instructor-led values training, and people leader trainings. We launched our mentorship program under the banner of IMPACT: Individualized Mentorship Program Aiming at Creating a Transformational workplace. IMPACT offers select employees the opportunity to be mentored by leaders at Sterling and participate in various virtual forums over the course of the six-month program. 
•Health and Wellness. We offer comprehensive and competitive benefits globally including retirement plans, generous vacation time, unlimited sick days, leave programs, and allowances for meals and transportation in some countries. Our benefits and programs focus on both the physical and the mental health of employees. We have introduced Sterling WOW (Working on Wellbeing), a global initiative designed to provide opportunities to connect and access resources that support and strengthen mental, physical, financial and community wellbeing. 
•Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”). At Sterling, we are committed to diversity and inclusion by championing and accepting individual uniqueness and cultivating a safe culture of belonging so that everyone can perform at their best in support of our clients, candidates and communities we serve. Our multi-year D&I strategic focus is to enhance diversity throughout our global workforce; energize our inclusive workplace culture; and partner to strengthen outcomes in the global marketplace. We do this in many ways including through our global employee resource groups (“ERGs”), intentional D&I training and focused communication to encourage difficult conversations, while providing employees with the tools and knowledge required to be an ally and an advocate for our diverse workforce. We are proud that women represent more than half of our global employee workforce as well as half of our senior leadership team.
We believe that our culture creates an environment where people are engaged, proud of the work they do and want to remain, as evidenced by 83% of respondents in our fourth quarter 2022 employee pulse survey saying they would recommend Sterling to a friend or colleague.
As of December 31, 2022, we have over 6,000 active employees, including 4,500 in our offshore captive operations in India and the Philippines. We also engage temporary employees and consultants when needed to enhance our workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced any work stoppages. We consider the relationships we have with our employees to be excellent.
Competition
The market for global background and identity verification services is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete with global competitors as well as regional providers.
The global background screening services market can be broken down into the following categories:
•Global Full-Suite Players. Players in this category, where Sterling competes, are characterized by their global scale and enterprise offerings. Other competitors in this category include First Advantage and HireRight. Sterling differentiates itself from other players in this category through its highly specialized and innovative solutions, exceptional client support backed by deep market knowledge, fulfillment reliability, service quality (speed, accuracy, and compliance), and robust integration capabilities.
•Mid-Tier Players. These competitors tend to focus on a particular geographic region, industry or product line, and have limited global capabilities. Examples of mid-Tier players are Accurate Background, ADP, Cisive, Checkr, DISA, and Triton. Sterling differentiates itself from these players through its service quality, regional compliance expertise, consultative client support, global service and fulfillment capabilities, and price.
•Small and Independently-Owned Players. There are hundreds of small and independently-owned background screening players. These players tend to focus on one to two verticals. They typically serve SMBs, license their platform from third parties, and rely on vendors for fulfillment. When Sterling competes and wins against these players, we generally do so based on our modern proprietary 
platform, compliance expertise, robust integration ecosystem, and exceptional service delivery times and accuracy.
The identity verification market is vast and growing. There are a multitude of applications for identity verification ranging from background screening, to consumer identification services, to government-controlled security access points. Supporting these applications are a variety of companies providing either technologies or services. Sterling primarily operates in the background screening and credential verification subsector of this market as well as the biometric capture and record channeling subsector.
In the identity verification background screening and credential verification subsector, we compete with a few global full-suite and mid-tier background screening players. Sterling differentiates itself through our integration of identity verification into our proprietary platform as well as the breadth of identity verification technologies we offer and our partnerships with ID.me in the U.S. and with Yoti internationally.
In the identity verification, biometric capture and record channeling subsector we compete with a few fingerprint network providers. We win in this space based on our technology, security, captive nationwide network of fingerprint collection sites and being FINRA’s exclusive fingerprint services provider.
In general, we compete for business based on numerous factors, including service speed, accuracy and results, ease-of-use, breadth of offering, fulfillment reliability, compliance expertise, reputation, client service, platform quality and price.
Regulation
Many aspects of our business are subject to regulation in a number of jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally. In these jurisdictions, government regulators oversee the conduct of our business, and have broad powers to promulgate and/or interpret laws, rules, and regulations that may serve to restrict or limit our operations.
We are subject to laws and regulations globally regarding among other things, the collection, use, disclosure, sale, transfer, receipt, storage, transmission, destruction, and other processing of personal data, including, among others, (i) the FCRA and state consumer reporting agency regulations, (ii) the GDPR, (iii) the U.K. data protection regime (the “U.K. GDPR”), (iv) the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), (v) the Drivers’ Privacy Protection Act and (vi) the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”). In addition, a November 2019 settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) also requires us to comply with the FCRA. These laws and regulations increase our operational requirements and subject us to risk of costly governmental fines and penalties, as well as private claims.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on developing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as confidential information, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, domain names, copyrights, patents, and U.S. and foreign registrations and applications for the foregoing. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, clients, suppliers, partners and vendors. While we believe that our intellectual property, in the aggregate, is generally important to our business and operations, we do not regard any aspect of our business as being dependent upon any single intellectual property right. We rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protections.
Seasonality
Demand for our products and services and our revenue is affected seasonally by macroeconomic hiring trends. Typically, revenue acceleration begins in the first quarter, with steady growth across the quarters as hiring accelerates. The fourth quarter, ending December 31, is typically our lowest revenue quarter due to a general market trend of lower hiring during the latter half of December due to the holidays. Also, certain clients across various industries historically have ramped up their hiring throughout the first half of the year as winter concludes, commercial activity tied to outdoor activities increases, and the school year ends, giving rise to student and graduate hiring. 
Supplier Diversity
As a global leader in background and identity services, we pride ourselves on not only finding the right people for our clients, but also the right vendors for our business. We recognize the importance of having a diverse vendor base that reflects our customers around the world. We embrace diversity through our employees, our suppliers and partners we work with, our customers, and the communities in which we work and live. Sterling’s vendor diversity mission is to proactively identify, build relationships with, and purchase goods and services from certified diverse businesses. Sterling’s Vendor Diversity Program is administered and monitored by the Strategic Sourcing & Global Procurement team. The program is governed by internal goals and contractual commitments to our clients. At Sterling, we understand the critical need to vet and perform due diligence on vendors within our supply base. A thorough due diligence process allows us to identify diverse vendors and include those vendors in our day-to-day screening business. We further expect our suppliers to operate within the framework of principles, guidelines, and policies aligned with our ethical, social, and environmental responsibilities, as described in our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Indemnification and Insurance
Our business exposes us to potential liability including, but not limited to, potential liability for (i) breach of contract or negligence claims by our customers, (ii) non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and (iii) employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, we may also be liable for the acts or omissions of others, such as suppliers of goods or services.
We attempt to manage our potential liability to third parties through contractual protection (such as indemnification and limitation of liability provisions) in our contracts with customers and others, and through insurance. The contractual indemnification provisions vary in scope and generally do not protect us against some potential liabilities, such as liability arising out of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, in the event that we seek to enforce such an indemnification provision, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient resources to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or may otherwise not comply with its contractual obligations. Further, the limitation of liability provisions in our customer contracts also vary in scope, thresholds and exclusions.
We currently maintain errors, omissions and professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe to be appropriate. However, the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims made and such claims may be contested by applicable insurance carriers.
