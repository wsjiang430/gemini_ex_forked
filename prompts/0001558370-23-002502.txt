ITEM 1.               Business.
​
Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) have been engaged in the manufacture and sale of confectionery products for over 100 years. This is the only industry segment in which the Company operates and is its only line of business. The majority of the Company’s products are sold under the registered trademarks TOOTSIE ROLL, TOOTSIE FRUIT ROLLS, FROOTIES, TOOTSIE POPS, TOOTSIE MINI POPS, CHILD’S PLAY, CARAMEL APPLE POPS, CHARMS, BLOW-POP, CHARMS MINI POPS, CELLA’S, DOTS, JUNIOR MINTS, CHARLESTON CHEW, SUGAR DADDY, SUGAR BABIES, ANDES, FLUFFY STUFF, DUBBLE BUBBLE, RAZZLES, CRY BABY, NIK-L-NIP, and TUTSI POP (Mexico).
​
The Company’s products are marketed in a variety of packages designed to be suitable for display and sale in different types of retail outlets. They are sold through food and grocery brokers or directly by the Company itself to customers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. These customers include wholesale distributors of candy, food and groceries, supermarkets, variety stores, dollar stores, chain grocers, drug chains, discount chains, cooperative grocery associations, mass merchandisers, warehouse and membership club stores, vending machine operators, e-commerce merchants, the U.S. military and fund-raising charitable organizations.
​
The Company’s principal markets are in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The majority of production from the Company’s Canadian plants is sold in the United States. The majority of production from the Company’s Mexican plant is sold in Mexico.
​
The domestic confectionery business is highly competitive. The Company competes primarily with other manufacturers of confectionery products sold to the above mentioned customers. Although accurate statistics are not available, the Company believes it is among the ten largest domestic manufacturers in this field. In the markets in which the Company competes, the main forms of competition comprise brand recognition, as well as competition for retail shelf space and a fair price for the Company’s products at various retail price points.
​
The Company’s backlog of orders as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $16 million and is consistent with the prior year. 
​
The Company has historically hedged certain of its future sugar needs with derivatives at such times that it believes that the forward markets are favorable. The Company’s decision to hedge its major ingredient requirements is dependent on the Company’s evaluation of forward commodity markets and their comparison to vendor quotations, if

available, and/or historical costs. The Company has generally entered into commodity futures contracts before the commencement of the next calendar year to better manage product pricing changes or product weight decline (indirect price change) adjustments to its product sales portfolio and ingredient costs. The Company will generally purchase forward derivative contracts (i.e., “long” position) in selected future months that correspond to the Company’s estimated procurement and usage needs of the respective commodity in the respective forward periods.
​
From time to time, the Company will increase its sales prices to recover higher input costs, primarily ingredients, packaging materials, and freight and delivery. The Company may also change the size and weight of certain of its products in response to significant changes in ingredient and other input costs.
​
The Company does not hold any material patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. The Company’s major trademarks are registered in the United States, Canada, Mexico and in many other countries. Continued trademark protection is of material importance to the Company’s business as a whole.
​
Although the Company does research and develops new products and product line extensions for existing brands, it also improves the quality of existing products, improves and modernizes production processes, and develops and implements new technologies to enhance the quality and reduce the costs of products in order to provide value to its consumers. The Company does not expend material amounts of money on research or development activities.
​
The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, the Company’s activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate the businesses outside of the United States. The Company maintains quality assurance, food safety and other programs to help ensure that all products the Company manufactures and distributes are safe and of high quality and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
​
The Company’s compliance with federal, state and local regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company nor does the Company anticipate any such material effects from presently enacted or adopted regulations.
​
The Company employs approximately 2,300 full-time persons at all locations. Our business has seasonality which results in bringing on some additional employees to meet seasonal production demands principally in advance of the Halloween selling season in the third quarter each year. The Company experiences a relatively consistent sales level throughout the year except for an increase in the third quarter which reflects pre-Halloween and back-to-school sales. In anticipation of this seasonal sales period, the Company generally begins building inventories, and its seasonal workforce, in the second and third quarter of each year. Although Halloween is the most significant season in sales and related production, other seasons, including Christmas, Valentines, and Easter also have some impact on workforce levels. The Company’s union labor agreement at its Chicago plant was executed in 2018 and expired in September 2022. The Company and the union have agreed to continue the existing contract on a month to month basis while negotiations continue (see also risk factor below), which is consistent with past contract negotiation timelines.
​

Tree, Inc. (which includes net sales from Family Dollar which is owned by Dollar Tree) aggregated approximately 12.4%, 12.1%, and 11.7% of net product sales during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Some of the aforementioned sales to Wal-Mart and Dollar Tree were sold to McLane Company, a large national grocery wholesaler, which services and delivers certain of the Company’s products to Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree and other retailers in the U.S.A. Net product sales revenues from McLane, which includes these Wal-Mart and Dollar Tree sales as well as sales and deliveries to other Company customers, were 20.4% in 2022 and 21.0% in 2021 and 22.1% in 2020. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s three largest customers discussed above accounted for approximately 39% and 36% of total accounts receivable, respectively. Although no customer, other than McLane Company, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Dollar Tree, accounted for more than 10% of net product sales, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company historically offers extended credit terms for sales made under seasonal sales programs, including Halloween. Each year, after accounts receivables related to third quarter sales have been collected, the Company invests such funds in various marketable securities.
