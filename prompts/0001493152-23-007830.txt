OMNIMETRIX – POWER GENERATION MONITORING AND CONTROL AND CATHODIC PROTECTION MONITORING AND CONTROL
 
OmniMetrix is a Georgia limited liability company based in Buford, Georgia that develops and markets wireless remote monitoring and control systems and services for critical assets (including stand-by power generators, pumps, pumpjacks, light towers, turbines, compressors, fire pumps and other industrial equipment) and multiple markets in the IoT ecosystem, as well as cathodic protection solutions for the pipeline industry (gas utilities and pipeline companies). Acorn owns 99% of OmniMetrix, with the remaining 1% owned by OmniMetrix’s former CEO.
 
Following the emergence of IoT applications whereby companies aggregate multiple sensors and monitors into a simplified dashboard for customers, OmniMetrix believes it plays a key role in this economic ecosystem. In addition, OmniMetrix continues to see a rapidly growing need for backup power infrastructure to secure critical military, government, and private sector assets against emergency events including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, demand response and cybersecurity threats. Residential and industrial standby generators, turbines, compressors, pumps, pumpjacks, light towers and other industrial equipment are part of the critical infrastructure increasingly being monitored in IoT applications. OmniMetrix solutions monitor critical equipment used by cell towers, manufacturing plants, medical facilities, data centers, retail stores, public transportation systems, energy distribution and federal, state and municipal government facilities, in addition to residential back-up generators. Given that OmniMetrix monitors all major brands of critical equipment and continues to invest in research and development in response to customer and potential customer feedback, OmniMetrix is well-positioned to grow its customer base and expand its product offerings in this market.
 
Products & Services
 
In the PG segment, OmniMetrix sells a line of devices and services built on our baseline TrueGuard wireless remote monitor. These devices are broadly applicable across all brands and models of emergency power generators and industrial engine applications. The TrueGuard product family connects directly to the engine’s control panel and captures all data flowing through the control panel. As a result, the product provides the ability to identify whether an emergency generator is capable of operating as expected. OmniMetrix also sells our AIRGuard product which remotely monitors and controls industrial air compressors and our Smart Annunciator product which is typically sold to commercial customers that require a visual representation of the generator’s status and has a large touch-screen display.
 
In the CP segment, OmniMetrix offers three primary product lines: the Hero 2 Rectifier Monitor, the Patriot Plus Test Station Monitor, and the RADTM (Remote AC Mitigation Disconnect). All of these products are used to monitor cathodic protection systems, a process which reduces rust and corrosion on pipelines used to transport natural gas. As the name suggests, the Hero 2 Rectifier Monitor product monitors and controls the operation of the rectifiers, which are a critical component in the effort to prevent corrosion and are also the most common point of failure in the pipeline system. The Patriot Plus Test Station Monitor is also used to provide data points along the pipeline segment powered by the rectifier including AC current density. The industry’s first and patented RAD mounts onto existing Solid-state Decouplers in the field and can remotely disconnect/connect these AC mitigation tools which drastically reduces company expense while increasing employee safety.
 
Customers and Markets
 
At its core, the OmniMetrix family of PG monitors (TrueGuard PRO and TrueGuard 2) can remotely monitor and control a variety of industrial engine applications, including engines, standby generators, air and gas compressors, fire pumps, batteries, turbines, pumps and other equipment. Early in the company’s history, a strategic decision was made to focus primarily on the standby power generation market. In the past several years, the company has expanded its focus to add several additional applications where it sees demand. Standby generator monitoring is part of the IoT ecosystem, whereby multiple sensing and monitoring devices are aggregated into one simple dashboard for customers.
 
As OmniMetrix can monitor and control all major brands of standby generators, it is well-positioned to compete in this market.
 
In the early stages of OmniMetrix’s PG product and market development, relatively unsophisticated generator controls and early generation cellular and satellite communication processes limited the applications to alarm delivery. Customers were notified that some event had taken place after the fact. There was no diagnostic data opportunity, but service organizations could, at best, practice a reactive service approach.

With the advent of second-generation cellular systems and newer, computerized engine controls, OmniMetrix migrated to a design point of collecting large amounts of performance data from remote machinery, allowing service organizations to perform diagnostics on equipment before dispatching service. These enhanced control panels allowed the service organization to put the right person in the right truck with the right parts to effect a one-trip or a zero-trip solution. At this phase, service organizations could be efficient, proactive, and provide a higher level of customer satisfaction. They could also manage more customers by using remote monitoring. Customers have provided OmniMetrix feedback telling how customer service teams are able to work “smarter” and more efficiently by going directly to sites with problems, thus increasing the value of their businesses.
 
OmniMetrix is now focused on expanding its product offerings while it also continues to execute in its third phase of evolution, maturing the high-performance data collection design point into the first provider offering of automated prognostic solutions. For example, as most generator failures are the result of consumables, and as those consumables can be monitored, the consumption trends can be extrapolated into predictions of the most common failure modes.
 
OmniMetrix’s PG monitors have been installed on commercial, industrial and residential generators from original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) such as Caterpillar, Kohler, Generac, Cummins, Briggs & Stratton, MTU Energy and other generator manufacturers. OmniMetrix provides dual value propositions to the generator service organizations as well as to the machine owner. The dealers benefit from the receipt of performance data and status conditions from the generators they service for their customers, which allows the dealer service organization to be proactive in their delivery of service to their customers, as well as analyzing the remote machines before dispatching a service truck. Since the majority of service and warranty costs are incurred from the service providers, preemptive analysis of customer site conditions prior to dispatch can reduce their labor cost. From the machine owner’s perspective, the OmniMetrix product provides a powerful tool to be used in their constant effort to avoid failures that come from consumables such as batteries and fuel. With proper monitoring, 95% of machine failures can be avoided completely. This migration from failure reporting to failure prevention is fundamentally OmniMetrix’s focus and is the result of a strong data collection and analysis design point. We believe that this transition to prognostics sets OmniMetrix apart from its competitors, many of whom are still in the failure reporting phase of application development. OmniMetrix has shifted its primary focus to the commercial and industrial segments from residential due, in part, to the ability to customize our products to the customers’ specifications. We have also increased our marketing efforts to end-users in an effort to increase demand for our services. These efforts have proven to be successful, and OmniMetrix continues to execute on that strategy.
 
Competition
 
OmniMetrix is a vertical market company, deeply focused on providing excellent customer experience and product and service designs for a complete end-to-end program for its customers. Having been the first provider of wireless remote monitoring systems for standby generators, the company has had the opportunity to mature its offering to a level not offered by others who compete in our two segments. This long experience working with key brand and project partners over the years has resulted in product offerings that are highly competitive.
 
There are two types of competitors in the PG marketplace:
 

(1) | Independent monitoring organizations (such as OmniMetrix) produce the monitoring systems, but not the equipment being monitored. Among these are companies such as Ayantra, FleetZOOM, Gen-Tracker, and PowerTelematics. The other competitors operate in the reactive “failure notification” mode described in the early stages of the OmniMetrix business model. These competitors position themselves in a lower-performance, lower-price quadrant of the market typically due to the lesser amount of data their products can collect from the generator’s control panel compared to OmniMetrix. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | OEMs such as generator manufacturers or generator controls manufacturers that offer customer connectivity to their machinery. They offer a current generation connectivity replacing telephone dial-up modems that had been used in the past. Their offerings are limited to their own brands, so they do not fit into broad applications like the OmniMetrix products that service all brands. They are also generally designed for the machine owners’ use, in a reactive application.

We believe OmniMetrix has a well-established and well-defended position in the high-performance PG monitoring segment, due to its long history and numerous industry partner projects. While the execution of our aggressive sales strategy was interrupted by the impact of COVID-19, the company has resumed an aggressive sales effort into the market segment requiring less technology and lower price (including the extremely large residential generator market) as well as developing more sophisticated, diagnostic products and custom solutions for commercial and industrial clientele.
 
Within the CP marketplace, there are no OEM competitors, but there are several companies that provide monitoring capabilities similar to OmniMetrix such as Mobiltex Solutions, Abriox, Elecsys, and American Innovations. We believe that OmniMetrix systems provide greater functionality than these competitors, though those competitors are much larger and have greater resources, potentially enabling better channel penetration than OmniMetrix can accomplish.
 
Intellectual Property
 
OmniMetrix has always focused on being the technology leader in its markets, and as a result has created many “industry firsts” and “trade secrets”. Initially, the company only pursued patents on the most valuable processes and systems and otherwise made public disclosure of many processes to prevent others from making later patent claims on those items. Nonetheless, OmniMetrix has four issued valid patents. Furthermore, the company has agreements with its employees and consultants which establish certain non-disclosure and, in some cases, non-compete, requirements. OmniMetrix continually evaluates whether and how to best protect its intellectual property, but there can be no assurance that its efforts will be successful in all cases.
Facilities
 
OmniMetrix’s activities are currently conducted in 21,000 square feet of office and production space in the Hamilton Mill Business Park located in Buford, Georgia, under a lease that expires September 30, 2025. On July 6, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with King Industrial Realty, Inc., to sublease from the Company 1,900 square feet of unused office space. The sublease commenced on October 1, 2021 and will run through September 30, 2025, which is the end of the Company’s lease term with its landlord.
BACKLOG
 
As of December 31, 2022, OmniMetrix had a backlog of $6.2 million, primarily comprised of deferred revenue, of which $4.0 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2023. This compares to a backlog of $5.4 million at December 31, 2021.
