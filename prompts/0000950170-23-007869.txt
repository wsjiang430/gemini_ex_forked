Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the research and development of GeneTACTM molecules, which are a novel class of small-molecule gene targeted chimera therapeutic candidates designed to be disease-modifying by addressing the underlying cause of diseases caused by inherited nucleotide repeat expansion mutations. Certain diseases caused by inherited nucleotide repeat expansion, such as Friedreich ataxia (FA) and fragile X syndrome, can result in reduced gene expression and deficiency of vital proteins; in other diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type-1 (DM1), Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), and Huntington disease, the nucleotide repeat expansions result in the generation of toxic gene products, often associated with pathological nuclear foci and broad splicing disruptions. Our GeneTACTM small molecules are designed to selectively target expanded genetic repeat sequences, modulate gene expression either by dialing up or down mRNA transcription, depending on the cause of the disease, and restore cellular health. As a platform, we believe that GeneTACTM molecules have broad potential applicability across currently unaddressed degenerative, monogenic nucleotide repeat expansion diseases affecting millions of individuals worldwide.
 
In preclinical studies for our lead program in FA, we have observed restoration of frataxin (FXN) levels in multiple cell types from FA patients and an in vivo murine model of FA using our FA GeneTACTM molecules. At doses that were observed to be well tolerated in rodents and non-human primates, FA GeneTACTM molecules achieved biodistribution to brain and heart, key organs affected by FA, at concentrations that exceeded those observed to restore FXN levels in FA patient cells. Further, and consistent with this favorable target-organ biodistribution, we observed increased endogenous FXN expression in the brain and heart in an animal model of FA after treatment with our FA GeneTACTM molecules. In February 2022, the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for our lead FA GeneTACTM development candidate (DT-216) was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to DT-216 for the treatment of patients with FA. In March 2022, we completed dosing in the first cohort for the single-ascending dose (SAD) Phase 1 clinical trial of DT-216. In December 2022, we reported positive initial data from the SAD clinical trial showing that DT-216 was generally well-tolerated and able to overcome the FXN transcription impairment that causes FA, with a greater than two-fold increase in FXN mRNA in the cohort with the highest response. These data support the continued advancement of DT-216 in the ongoing multiple-ascending dose (MAD) Phase 1 clinical trial of DT-216 and the anticipated Phase 2 clinical trial in FA patients, which is expected to begin in the second half of 2023.
 
In December 2022, we nominated our second GeneTACTM development candidate (DT-168), an eye drop for the treatment of FECD. When tested in vitro in FECD patient-derived corneal endothelial cells, our FECD GeneTACTM molecules led to robust reductions in the pathogenic nuclear RNA foci and corrected key mis-spliced transcripts to levels observed in control corneal endothelial cells from unaffected donors. DT-168 was well tolerated and distribution of DT-168 was observed in and through the cornea in animal models after administration via eye drop. We believe these preclinical data support the potential of our novel GeneTACTM small molecules to correct the most common underlying genetic cause of FECD, and we plan to advance this research program through additional preclinical studies and submit an IND for DT-168 in the second half of 2023.
 
Our third program based on the GeneTACTM platform is DM1. Multiple DM1 GeneTACTM molecules elicited robust reduction of nuclear foci and correction of splicing defects in DM1 patient muscle cells. Preclinical in vivo studies demonstrated distribution of DM1 GeneTACTM molecules to key target tissues including skeletal muscle and heart, achieving tissue concentrations of intact DM1 GeneTACTM molecule that reduced pathogenic nuclear foci to normal levels in our in vitro experiments. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies and submit an IND in 2024.

We have continued to make significant progress in advancing our GeneTACTM portfolio in preclinical studies to address other serious nucleotide repeat expansion-driven monogenic diseases, and intend to declare additional product candidates as they progress towards the clinic.
 

We believe the structure and mechanism of action of our GeneTACTM molecules may offer the disease-modifying potential of genomic therapeutics, while also offering broad tissue biodistribution, resolution of aberrant gene expression preserving endogenous regulatory control elements, and leveraging established manufacturing, regulatory, and distribution frameworks for small molecules.
 
Our GeneTACTM Platform
 
We utilize our proprietary GeneTACTM platform to design and develop therapeutic candidates for inherited diseases driven by nucleotide repeat expansion. Individuals with nucleotide repeat expansion diseases are born with abnormally expanded stretches of specific nucleotide sequences, often with hundreds to thousands of excess repeats present in the mutant gene. Higher number of excess repeats can lead to more severe, and sometimes a more rapidly progressive form of disease. Nucleotide repeat expansion has been identified as the underlying cause of more than 40 debilitating degenerative diseases impacting millions of people. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic options that address the cause of any nucleotide repeat expansion diseases.
 
Specific DNA sequences of a gene can generate RNA through a process called transcription. The RNA is, in turn, used as a template to make the proteins that control cellular functions in a process called translation. Combined, transcription and translation are responsible for gene expression. Individuals who have a nucleotide repeat expansion in the DNA can experience different alterations of transcription. In some diseases such as FA, the transcription machinery stalls at the abnormally expanded repeat sequence leading to insufficient production of a critical protein called FXN. In other cases, such as in DM1, the abnormal RNA transcript arising from the nucleotide repeat expansion mutation is misprocessed, leading to a cascade of downstream toxicity and cellular dysfunction.
 
GeneTACTM molecules represent a novel class of small molecules designed to act on a diverse array of diseases and selectively target genetic repeat sequences, modulate gene expression either by dialing up or down mRNA transcription, and restore cellular health. We have developed a proprietary framework that combines our understanding of medicinal chemistry and structure-activity relationships that allow us to design DNA-targeting moieties that are connected via a linker to ligand moieties that engage and modulate the transcriptional machinery. GeneTACTM molecules are heterobifunctional, meaning that they are comprised of two principal moieties that are each designed to have a unique function:
 
•DNA-Targeting Moiety: one end of the GeneTACTM molecule is a DNA targeting molecule that has been designed to recognize and target the molecule to the specific nucleotide repeat sequence of interest (e.g. the repeated GAA sequence seen in the first intron of the FXN gene seen in FA or the CTG repeat in the 3’ non-coding region of the dystrophy myotonic protein kinase (DMPK) gene seen in DM1).
 
•Ligand Moiety: the other end of the molecule is designed to interact with the endogenous proteins that can regulate transcription to either dial up or dial down the expression of an individual gene.
 



The structures of the GeneTACTM molecules are designed to enable them to act specifically at the site of the disease-causing nucleotide repeat expansion by targeting the mutant allele and modulating the transcriptional machinery in a cell. Consequently, the cell can resume gene expression and production of normal protein isoforms that remain under normal physiological control. The versatility of the GeneTACTM platform allows us to design GeneTACTM molecules toward a specific nucleotide repeat expansion target, regardless of repeat number, and tailor it to address the underlying disease-specific dysfunction in gene regulation in one of the following ways:
 
•Restoration of Transcription: In diseases where the expanded nucleotide repeat structure can cause endogenous transcription machinery to stall, which leads to an insufficient amount of protein production, GeneTACTM molecules can be designed to target the desired loci in the genome and engage the endogenous transcriptional machinery with the goal of restoring normal levels of full-length pre-mRNAs. In FA, for example, where the expanded triplet repeat occurs in an intron, a non-coding region of the gene, the abnormally long nucleotide sequence is spliced out of the pre-mRNA thus enabling normal production of natural protein isoforms according to existing physiologic regulatory control.
 
•Reduction of Toxic Gene Product Levels: Another type of nucleotide repeat expansion disease occurs when the transcription process results in the accumulation of toxic gene products (e.g. DM1, Huntington disease, FECD), and in some cases the formation of nuclear foci, leading to multiple downstream cellular dysfunctions. In these cases, a single copy of expanded repeat containing allele is sufficient to cause the disease. Our GeneTACTM molecules are designed to selectively target the abnormally expanded nucleotide repeat to block the formation of the downstream toxic gene product and restore cellular function without interfering with the gene expression of the normal allele.
 
Our understanding of the properties of the GeneTACTM molecules is based on data-driven assessments of compounds we have designed and synthesized, as well as experience with our most advanced compounds for FA, FECD and DM1 tested in vitro and in vivo. We continue to develop know-how of diverse configurations of DNA targeting, linker, and ligand moieties that drive the drug properties of molecules which are best suited to be developed for treating the underlying cause of each specific disease. This understanding of GeneTACTM chemistry has enabled us to generate multiple candidates designed to have optimal potential therapeutic and drug characteristics.
 
Our Programs
 
We are developing a portfolio of GeneTACTM product candidates designed to address genetic diseases driven by inherited nucleotide repeat expansions that have urgent medical need and where no approved disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Because GeneTACTM molecules are designed to be a novel class of disease-modifying small molecule therapeutic candidates, we have selected disease programs where we believe the underlying cause is amenable to intervention using our technology and prioritized our development efforts where we believe there is a clear and efficient path to advance these candidates through clinical development, with the goal of providing a disease-modifying therapy for patients.
 

Our lead candidates and early development programs are summarized in the table below:
 
Figure 1: GeneTACTM Pipeline
 



FA Program Overview (DT-216)
 
Our FA program is focused on the development of a potentially disease-modifying treatment. FA is a devastating monogenic, autosomal recessive progressive disease where over 95% of cases are caused by homozygous guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) triplet repeat expansions in the first intron of the FXN gene, which encodes the mitochondrial protein FXN. The disease is characterized by spinocerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, pyramidal weakness, deep sensory loss, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal abnormalities, and diabetes mellitus. Clinical onset occurs most often around puberty, leads to severe disability by early adulthood, with substantial functional loss, wheelchair dependence, and loss of quality of life. Affected individuals have reduced life expectancy, with many premature deaths caused by complications of the cardiomyopathy at about the end of the fourth decade of life.
 
The estimated prevalence of FA is 1 in 40,000-50,000, affecting more than 5,000 individuals living in the United States and more than 20,000 in Europe. Our FA GeneTACTM candidate is designed to address the genetic basis of the disease by restoring functional FXN protein levels. In December 2022, we reported positive initial data from the SAD clinical trial showing that DT-216 was generally well-tolerated and able to overcome the FXN transcription impairment that causes FA. We anticipate the continued advancement of our first product candidate in the ongoing MAD Phase 1 clinical trial and the Phase 2 clinical trial, which is expected to begin in the second half of 2023.
 
FECD Program Overview (DT-168)
 
Our FECD program is focused on the development of a potentially disease-modifying medical treatment for FECD. FECD is characterized by progressive degeneration of the corneal endothelium and subsequent loss of vision. This genetic eye disease affects millions of people in the U.S., with approximately 75% of cases caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion within the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene, leading to the formation of pathogenic RNA foci, global splicing dysregulation, cellular dysfunction, and eventual loss of corneal endothelial cells. Due to the lack of disease-modifying therapies approved for FECD, corneal surgery is currently the only approved procedure used to restore vision. Our approach utilizes our FECD GeneTAC molecules to selectively target the expanded CTG repeats in the TCF4 gene to reduce RNA foci formation and mis-splicing. We believe our preclinical data to date supports the potential of our FECD GeneTAC small molecules to correct the most common underlying genetic cause of FECD, and we plan to submit an IND for DT-168 in the second half of 2023.
DM1 Program Overview
 
Our DM1 program is focused on the development of a potentially disease-modifying treatment for DM1. DM1 is a monogenic, autosomal dominant, progressive neuromuscular disease that affects skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and other organs. The cardinal features include muscle weakness, myotonia (slow muscle relaxation), and early cataracts. In addition, affected individuals often experience cardiac arrhythmias, changes in neuropsychological function, and gastrointestinal symptoms. DM1 is caused by a mutation in the DMPK gene and is estimated to have a genetic prevalence of 1 in 2,300-8,000 people, affecting more than 70,000 people in the United States and more than 90,000 people in Europe. Our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules are designed to address the genetic cause of the disease by preventing the expression of mutant gene product and consequently of pathogenic nuclear foci. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies and submit an IND in 2024.
Research Program Overview
 
We are also advancing our GeneTACTM product candidate portfolio into development in other serious nucleotide repeat expansion-driven monogenic diseases, such as fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia. Many of these monogenic diseases have overlapping triplet repeat expansions, including CTG repeats that cause DM1, allowing for the accumulating knowledge on how to design novel molecules to be applied across multiple diseases also caused by CTG and CAG repeat expansions. Additionally, our medicinal chemistry experiences with GeneTACTM molecules allow us to more rapidly design GeneTACTM molecules for additional proposed indications.
Our Strategy
 
We aim to leverage our GeneTACTM platform to design, develop and commercialize a pipeline of disease-modifying therapeutic candidates designed to treat a wide range of inherited nucleotide repeat expansion diseases for which there is urgent unmet medical need. In order to achieve our goal, we intend to:
 
•Advance our Lead Program in FA Through Clinical Development to Offer Meaningful Patient Benefit. FA is a serious monogenic degenerative disease for which there are currently no available disease-modifying treatments. Our FA GeneTACTM molecules are specifically designed to restore levels of FXN, the underlying cause of FA. Restoration of FXN has been shown to improve FA-like symptoms in animal models. We believe that demonstrating clinical proof of concept by restoring FXN expression in FA patients may confirm the therapeutic potential of our FA GeneTACTM molecules and underscore the broader potential of our GeneTACTM platform. We have completed IND-enabling safety studies in both rats and non-human primates and received FDA clearance of our IND in late February 2022. In March 2022, we initiated the SAD Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with FA. In December 2022, we reported positive initial data from the SAD clinical trial showing that DT-216 was generally well-tolerated and able to overcome the FXN transcription impairment that causes FA, with a greater than two-fold increase in FXN mRNA in the cohort with the highest response. These data support the continued advancement of DT-216 in the ongoing MAD Phase 1 clinical trial of DT-216 and the anticipated Phase 2 clinical trial in FA patients, which is expected to begin in the second half of 2023.
 
•Advance our FECD Program Through Clinical Development to Offer Meaningful Patient Benefit. FECD is a genetic eye disease characterized by bilateral degeneration of corneal endothelial cells and progressive loss of vision, for which the only approved option for treatment is corneal surgery. DT-168 is our FECD GeneTACTM small molecule designed to target the CTG repeats in the TCF4 gene and selectively block transcription of the expansion-containing allele. IND-enabling studies are ongoing and we expect to submit an IND for DT-168 in the second half of 2023.


•Advance our DM1 Program Through Clinical Development to Offer Meaningful Patient Benefit. DM1 is a serious monogenic degenerative disease for which there are currently no available treatments. Our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules are specifically designed to reduce the formation of CUG repeat hairpin structures that trap splicing factors and form pathogenic nuclear foci that cause DM1. Blocking the formation of CUG foci has demonstrated phenotypic benefit. We believe that demonstrating clinical proof of concept by reducing the repeat hairpin structures in DM1 patients may confirm the therapeutic potential of this candidate. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies and submit an IND in 2024.
 
•Leverage our GeneTACTM Platform to Expand our Pipeline and Address Additional Nucleotide Repeat Expansion Diseases with Significant Unmet Medical Need. There remains a significant unmet medical need for all nucleotide repeat expansion diseases. We plan to advance our GeneTACTM portfolio to address the underlying cause of other serious nucleotide repeat expansion-driven monogenic diseases, which may include fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, the majority of which have no approved disease-modifying treatments.
 
•Selectively Enter Into Strategic Collaborations. Given the broad potential of our GeneTACTM platform, we may explore collaborations in select disease areas or geographic regions that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of a strategic partner to accelerate the development and commercialization of our GeneTACTM product candidates.
 
•Independently Commercialize any Approved Products in Indications and Geographies Where we Believe we can Maximize Value. We intend to commercialize our product candidates that receive regulatory approval in indications and geographies where we believe we can maximize value by commercializing on our own.
 
•Establish a Leadership Position in Genetic Diseases by Continuing to Build and Leverage our Relationships with the Key Opinion Leaders, Physicians, and Patients. We have an established advisory network of pharmaceutical research and development experts, scientists, clinicians and patient organizations in areas relevant to our programs. We have continued to grow our network as needed to inform our programs with the most up to date data and practices that might enhance our ability to effectively bring potentially life saving treatments to patients in need.

Background on Genomic Medicines
 
What is Genetic Disease?
 
Genetic diseases arise when a change to the DNA, called a mutation, disrupts normal cellular functioning. These mutations can range from alteration of a single nucleotide in an individual’s DNA to major abnormalities affecting many genes or even entire chromosomes. When a mutation occurs in a single gene, the disease is referred to as a monogenic disease. More than 10,000 monogenic diseases have been identified and many are serious conditions that collectively affect millions of people globally, most of which have no effective therapeutic options.
What is Genomic Medicine?
 
Genomic medicines are created based on understanding of genetic causes of disease, targeting specific defects at the genetic level with the potential to address the underlying cause of disease and restore cellular function.
 
Technical and scientific advances in genomics have identified possible genetic targets for therapeutic interventions. Several approaches have been developed to address diseases caused by genetic mutations, including oligonucleotides, mRNA, gene therapy and gene editing. While these technologies have led to numerous product candidates over the last decade, significant challenges have limited their utility in the clinic as a result of:
 
•immunogenicity that creates safety concerns and limits activity and re-dosing;
 
•unregulated gene expression;
 
•off-target effects;
 
•limitations of dose adjustments/silencing;
 
•limitations and heterogeneity of biodistribution; and
 
•challenges with consistency, quality and scalability of manufacturing.
 
Advantages of Our Platform
 
We are using our GeneTACTM platform to develop small molecule genomic medicine candidates that are designed to offer precise modulation of gene transcription. We believe that the GeneTACTM platform may offer several potential mechanistic and development advantages over other genomic medicine modalities, including:
 
•GeneTACTM small molecules may be more tolerable over complex biologics because GeneTACTM molecules are less likely to cause adverse immune reactions;
 
•GeneTACTM molecules may be less likely to be immunogenic and therefore have no limitations with re-dosing;
 
•GeneTACTM treatment is designed to be reversible;
 
•GeneTACTM molecules are designed to act on the transcription machinery of the cell and do not alter the genome;
 
•GeneTACTM molecules' modulation of transcription is designed to preserve normal physiological post-transcriptional regulation and protein translation controls;
 
•GeneTACTM structure is designed to enable therapeutically active molecules to be deployed directly at the site of disease-causing mutations, which could enhance specificity and potency, and minimize off-target effects;
 
•GeneTACTM molecules are designed to enable ongoing dose optimization;
 
•GeneTACTM molecules can achieve biodistribution across target organs and into the cell without specialized engineering or delivery technologies;
 

•GeneTACTM molecules are synthetically tractable, offering a potentially readily scalable, cost-effective development path that does not require complex customized manufacturing equipment and processes; and
 
•GeneTACTM molecules have a modular heterobifunctional structure that is intended to allow us to rationally design novel targeting components for specific DNA sequences, creating a potentially highly efficient discovery engine that could enable us to rapidly expand our portfolio into new disease areas.
 
By combining the disease-modifying potential of genomic medicines with the drug-like properties, manufacturing and logistics advantages of small molecules, we believe GeneTACTM molecules could be developed as novel therapeutic options in genetic diseases where disease-modifying treatments have previously been elusive.
 
Our Portfolio
 
Friedreich Ataxia
 
Disease Overview, Prevalence and Current Treatment Landscape
 
FA is a monogenic, autosomal recessive, progressive multi-system disease that affects organ systems highly dependent on mitochondrial function, eventually leading to neurological, cardiac, and metabolic dysfunction. Clinical manifestations include poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of balance and ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrythmia, and glucose intolerance, including diabetes. FA patients also report impaired vision, hearing and speech. FA significantly impairs quality of life with loss of independence, physical limitations and reduced participation in social activities and work.
 
The primary cause of mortality (approximately 60% of FA patients) is cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure with the mean life expectancy reduced to approximately 35-40 years.
 
In over 95% of patients, FA is caused by an inherited homozygous increase in the number of GAA triplet repeats found in the first intron of the FXN gene. The number of repeats ranges from up to approximately 30 GAA repeats in healthy individuals to over several hundred to over 1,000 in FA patients. The expanded triplet repeat results in gene silencing and reduction in capacity to produce the FXN protein, which is required for proper functioning of the mitochondria and ultimately the entire cell. Levels of FXN correlate inversely with disease severity, and when levels are reduced to levels of approximately 25% of normal healthy individuals, iron homeostasis and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis are impaired, leading to general impairment of normal mitochondrial function. Heterozygote carriers typically have approximately half of the FXN levels of normal individuals, but are asymptomatic and hence on average, the doubling of FXN protein levels in FA patients to achieve carrier levels or higher is expected to restore mitochondrial function and provide therapeutic benefit.
 

The genetic basis for FA is illustrated in Figure 2 below.
 
Figure 2: Genetic basis for FA
 


The clinical course of FA is progressive, with most patients presenting in their adolescent years with gait ataxia and scoliosis. About 10 years after disease onset, most patients lose their ability to walk and require a wheelchair because of progressive loss of balance and muscle weakness in the torso and legs. Eventually, muscle weakness in the tongue and throat makes it difficult to swallow and eat, and almost all patients experience some degree of dysarthria (slowing/slurring of speech), which limits communication. Approximately 50% of FA patients develop glucose intolerance and approximately 30% develop diabetes. More than two thirds of FA patients have cardiac abnormalities at baseline including arrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac abnormalities are responsible for approximately 60% of mortality in FA patients. FA significantly reduces life expectancy and impairs quality of life for patients and their families with loss of independence, physical limitations and reduced participation in social activities and work.
 
The estimated prevalence of FA is 1 in 40,000-50,000, affecting more than 5,000 individuals living in the United States and more than 20,000 in Europe.
 
On February 28, 2023, Reata Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA approved omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. In addition, there are several product candidates in clinical development but neither omaveloxolone nor any of these product candidates have shown the ability to restore the deficiency in FXN protein, which is the underlying cause of the disease. There remains a high unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies.
 
Our Approach
 
Our FA program is based on GeneTACTM small molecules consisting of a DNA-targeting moiety designed to target the expanded GAA repeat sequence in the first intron of the FXN gene in FA patients, linked to a ligand moiety designed to recruit an endogenous transcriptional elongation complex to unblock the transcriptional machinery, and restore the production of functional natural FXN proteins to therapeutic levels.
 

The key advantages of our FA program include the following:
 
•Designed to Address the Underlying Cause of the Disease. FA is caused by reduced FXN protein levels. All disease manifestations are downstream effects of FXN deficiency. Our FA GeneTACTM molecules are designed to restore FXN levels, thereby restoring normal physiological activity.
 
•High Potency Compounds. Our FA GeneTACTM molecules have shown high potency and prolonged restoration of FXN levels in preclinical assays in FA patient cells and in vivo model of FA.
 
•Designed for Efficient Delivery of Drug to the Target Organs. We have observed good biodistribution and bioavailability for FA GeneTACTM molecules in multiple animal species, where they reached therapeutically relevant concentrations in the most affected organs such as heart, brain, muscle and spinal cord.
 
Preclinical Data
 
We believe that the results of our preclinical studies to date support the hypotheses that FA GeneTACTM molecules may confer a clinical benefit to FA patients. In in vitro experiments in primary cells from FA patients and in neurons and cardiomyocytes derived from FA patient stem cells, robust and durable increases in FXN mRNA and protein restoration was observed following exposure to FA GeneTACTM molecules, even at low nanomolar (nM) concentrations. In preclinical studies, FA GeneTACTM molecules achieved therapeutically relevant concentrations in key organs of disease, including the heart, brain, muscle and spinal cord, at doses that were well tolerated in multiple species.
 
We assessed the FA GeneTACTM activity in in vitro and in vivo models of disease, including multiple types of FA patient cells such as primary white blood cells, lymphoblastoid cells, and cardiomyocytes and neurons derived from stem cells. In vivo studies were conducted in the Pook800J mouse model, which contains a hemizygous insertion of the human disease allele with approximately 800 GAA repeats onto a genetic background lacking endogenous mouse FXN.
 
Increase in FXN mRNA and Protein in FA Patient Neurons
 Continuous exposure to low doses of an FA GeneTACTM molecule (10 or 100nM) increased FXN expression in neurons derived from an FA patient stem cell line (Figure 3). Increases in FXN mRNA levels preceded increases in FXN protein, consistent with the typical pattern of gene expression. Of note, the increase in FXN protein levels after continuous treatment with 10 or 100 nM of the FA GeneTACTM molecule resulted in similar FXN protein levels which were also similar to - and did not exceed - those in a non-FA patient-derived neurons in culture (grey horizontal bar in Figure 3 right panel).

Figure 3. Neurons from an FA patient were incubated with 10 or 100 nM of an FA GeneTAC molecule continuously, and cells were harvested for determination of FXN mRNA (left) or protein (right) levels on Days 3, 7, 10, and 14. Data are depicted as Mean ± SD (n=3/group). Grey horizontal bar (right panel) indicates range of FXN protein levels in non-FA patient derived neurons on Day 14
 
In preclinical studies in Pook800J mice, we observed an increase in FXN protein levels in both heart and brain tissue after treatment with FA GeneTACTM molecules.
 
Distribution and Tolerability of FA GeneTACTM molecules
 
In preclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys, repeat intravenous (IV) administration of our FA GeneTACTM molecules at weekly intervals led to exposure in the plasma at concentrations above 10nM for up to 48 hours after the last dose, while exposure in key target organs in the context of functional deficits encountered in FA (Figure 4), including the heart, brain and skeletal muscle, sustained well above concentrations shown to increase FXN mRNA and protein in FA patient cells for at least 7 days after the last dose. FA GeneTACTM molecule was also shown to be well tolerated and resulted in no clinically meaningful changes in hematology, serum biochemistry or histology.

Plasma and tissues were collected from 2 monkeys at 6, 24, and 168 hours after the Day 15 dose for determination of FA GeneTACTM molecule levels by LC-MS/MS. Data are depicted as the Mean + SE.
 
Clinical Data
 
DT-216 Phase 1 SAD Trial Design
 
The Phase 1 SAD clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate single doses of DT-216 administered intravenously in adult patients with FA. The primary and secondary study objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of DT-216 in FA patients. Change in FXN mRNA and protein expression relative to baseline, measured in a circulating subset of white blood cells, known as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were included as exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments.
 
Thirty-nine FA patients (mean age 32 years, 49% female) were dosed across six dose cohorts (5-10 patients per cohort) ranging from 25 mg to 600 mg and were randomized to receive either DT-216 (N=26) or placebo (N=13). All patients were homozygous for a GAA repeat expansion (mean=580, SD=203).


The study protocol was prospectively designed for DT-216 to be administered either as a single dose bolus or as a single dose split-administration on the same day. Patients in Cohorts 1-4 were dosed with a single bolus dose of DT-216 at increasing levels from 25 mg to 200 mg. Patients in Cohort 5 (400 mg) received either a single dose bolus or single dose split administration of DT-216, and all patients in Cohort 6 (600 mg) received a single dose split administration of DT-216. Safety assessments were conducted for at least 30 days post dosing.
 
Initial data from Phase 1 SAD trial
 
DT-216 was generally well-tolerated throughout the Phase 1 SAD trial. Findings from Cohorts 1-5 were:
 •No treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported
 •16 (73%) patients on DT-216 and eight (73%) patients on placebo reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event
 •Most adverse events (AEs) were mild and transient; there were no severe AEs
 •No clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical exams, electrocardiogram, and clinical safety laboratories (including liver function tests and serum creatinine)
 •Three patients on DT-216 had a localized superficial vein thrombosis at the injection site; of which two were mild and one was moderate; and all three were self-limited 
 
Data from Cohort 4 (200 mg) were excluded from the analysis of PK and PD data due to third-party issues with sample handling. PK data were analyzed for patients that were treated with DT-216 in Cohorts 1-3, 5 and 6. Plasma levels of DT-216 increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner, with peak concentrations within minutes, followed by a decrease in plasma levels within several hours.

PD data were available for 33 patients (Cohorts 1-3, 5 and 6, Figure 5). Treatment with a single dose of DT-216 resulted in a 2.24-fold increase in FXN mRNA, at 24 hours post-dose compared with pre-treatment baseline, in the cohort with the highest response (p < 0.01 DT-216 [N=3] vs. pooled placebo [N=11]). Treatment with a single dose of DT-216 in all cohorts 100 mg and above resulted in a statistically significant increase in FXN mRNA at 24 hours post dose. Individual patient responses to single doses of DT-216 ranging from 100-600 mg resulted in an increase in FXN mRNA at 24 hours ranging from 1.24 to 2.62-fold. A relationship between plasma exposure and treatment effect was observed in PBMCs (Figure 6).
 
Figure 5: Greater than two-fold increase in FXN mRNA in PBMCs in cohort with highest response




Figure 5. Post-splice FXN mRNA was measured using intron spanning RT-qPCR to detect post-spliced mature mRNA in FA patients at baseline, 24 hours and 48 hours after dosing with DT-216. Pharmacodynamic data from Cohort 4 (200 mg) excluded from analysis due to third-party issues with sample handling. Exploratory statistical analyses were conducted using an ANCOVA model which includes a main effect for the treatment group and the baseline delta Ct as a covariate and compares each active treatment group against the pooled placebo group. The reported p values are based on parametric statistical analysis methods. Non-parametric analyses gave similar results. Bars represent standard error of the mean.

As expected with short-term plasma exposure, there was no observed increase in FXN protein from baseline in PBMCs from patients treated with a single dose of DT-216 or placebo. Ex vivo DT-216 treatment for 60 hours of PBMCs isolated pre-treatment from patients enrolled in this trial elicited a doubling of FXN protein levels, showing that, with sufficient duration of exposure to DT-216, an increase in FXN mRNA naturally translated to an increase in FXN protein.
 
Design is evaluating DT-216 in an ongoing MAD Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, biodistribution and PD effects of three weekly doses of DT-216 in adult patients with FA. Design plans to dose at least three cohorts and expects to report initial data from the MAD trial in mid-2023 with final data expected by year-end.
 
Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD)
 
Disease Overview, Prevalence and Current Treatment Landscape
 
FECD is a genetic eye disease characterized by bilateral degeneration of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) and progressive loss of vision. Typically, the disease manifests after age 40 and can be detected through routine eye exam. As individuals age, CECs become dysfunctional and degenerate and eventually fluid accumulates in the cornea (corneal edema). As disease progresses, FECD leads to reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, glare, and can eventually lead to corneal blindness. Other symptoms include pain and grittiness in the eye.
 
This genetic eye disease affects millions of people worldwide. Over 70% of FECD cases are caused by cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) nucleotide repeat expansions in the TCF4 gene, which is transcribed into pathogenic TCF4 RNA that forms nuclear foci and sequesters splicing proteins, leading to transcript mis-splicing (spliceopathy) and loss of CECs. CECs harbor the longest known TCF4 repeat expansions in the body, potentially explaining why the cornea is the only affected tissue. There is currently no effective therapeutic intervention that addresses the root cause of the disease. Various modalities of keratoplasty, including corneal transplantation, constitute the only treatment option to correct advanced FECD.
 
Our Approach
 
Our FECD program leverages our expertise in designing GeneTAC small molecules to address the underlying cause of the disease. FECD GeneTAC molecules we designed have been shown to markedly reduce nuclear foci and improve spliceopathy in FECD CEC cultures derived from the corneal tissue of donors who ultimately underwent corneal transplant.
 
In December 2022, we nominated DT-168 as a development candidate for FECD. DT-168 is a GeneTAC small molecule designed to target the CTG repeats in the TCF4 gene and selectively block transcription of the expansion-containing allele. DT-168 is currently the only therapeutic development program designed to address the genetic root cause of FECD while benefiting from the favorable development advantages of small molecules, including that it is designed to be applied as an eye drop. We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies to support continued development of DT-168.
 
Preclinical Data
 
In preclinical studies in FECD patient CECs that contained toxic nuclear TCF4 RNA, we observed reduction of pathogenic nuclear foci following exposure to our FECD GeneTACTM molecules. As illustrated in Figure 7, we observed a reduction in CTG nuclear foci in FECD patient CECs exposed to our FECD GeneTACTM molecules as determined through a fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging and analysis. This reduction was seen within several days after exposure to our FECD GeneTACTM molecules at therapeutically relevant concentrations (IC50<10 nM).



With suppression of the mutant TCF4 transcription, reduction of formation of pathogenic nuclear foci and release of splicing proteins, the FECD GeneTACTM molecules corrected aberrant splicing, thus allowing restoration of normal mRNA processing. As illustrated in Figure 8, FECD GeneTACTM molecules reduced the abnormal MBNL1 RNA levels to that seen in healthy CECs at therapeutically relevant concentrations in CECs from multiple FECD patients.
 
We formulated DT-168 as an eye drop and showed that it was well-tolerated following 2 weeks of topical ocular dosing in rabbits and distributed throughout the cornea.

The findings to date support further development of DT-168 as a potential disease-modifying therapy. We plan to submit an IND for DT-168 in the second half of 2023.

Myotonic Dystrophy Type-1 (DM1)
 
Disease Overview, Prevalence and Current Treatment Landscape
 
DM1 is a dominantly-inherited, monogenic progressive neuromuscular disease affecting skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and other organs. Clinical manifestations include muscle weakness, myotonia (slow muscle relaxation), early cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias and changes in neuropsychological function. DM1 is progressive and may become extremely disabling, leading to poor quality of life and early mortality.
 
DM1 is caused by a mutation that leads to an increased number of CTG triplet repeats found in the 3’ non-coding region of the DMPK gene (Figure 9). The number of repeats ranges from up to approximately 35 in healthy individuals to many thousands in DM1 patients. When transcribed, the higher-than-normal number of triplet repeats in terminal end of the mutant DMPK allele form pre-mRNAs with large CUG hairpin loops that remain entrapped in the nucleus and form clumps also called foci. Specifically, mutant DMPK pre-mRNA sequesters a critical CUG-binding protein, muscle blind-like protein 1 (MBNL1), which leads to the formation of pathogenic nuclear foci and inhibits the ability of MBNL1 in processing many pre-mRNAs. As a result, multiple pre-mRNAs that encode key proteins are mis-spliced. This mis-splicing in the nucleus results in the translation of atypical proteins, which ultimately cause the clinical presentation of DM1. When levels of mutant DMPK mRNA containing higher numbers of CUG repeats are reduced, nuclear foci are diminished and MBNL1 proteins are freed to function normally. This disease process is illustrated below:
 

Figure 9: DM1: Genetic basis and clinical presentation
 


DM1 is estimated to have a genetic prevalence of 1 in 2,300-8,000 people, affecting more than 70,000 people in the United States and more than 90,000 people in Europe. However, we believe that the patient population is currently underdiagnosed due to lack of available therapies. DM1 is typically categorized into four overlapping phenotypes based on age of onset: late-onset; classical (adult-onset); childhood; and congenital (cDM1).
 
Overview of DM1 phenotypes
 

Phenotype | Age of onset | Estimated % of DM1 patients
Late-onset | | 40+ years | ~10%
Classical | 10 – 40 years | ~65% to 75% 
(Adult-onset) | | 
Childhood | 1 - 10 years | ~15% 
Congenital | Birth | ~5% to 15% 
(cDM1) | | 

 
All DM1 phenotypes, except the late-onset form, are associated with high levels of disease burden and premature mortality. The clinical course of DM1 is progressive, and may become extremely disabling, especially when more generalized limb weakness and respiratory muscle involvement develops. Systemic manifestations such as fatigue, GI complications, cataracts and excessive daytime sleepiness greatly impact a patient’s quality of life. As a result, DM1 leads to physical impairment, activity limitations, decreased participation in social activities and work and impairs quality of life for patients and their families. Life expectancy in classical DM1 ranges from 48-55 years. Respiratory failure due to muscle weakness (especially diaphragmatic weakness) causes at least 50% of early mortality, and cardiac abnormalities, including sudden death, account for approximately 30% of early mortality.
 
There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of DM1, leaving a high unmet medical need and opportunity for new disease-modifying therapies. There are several product candidates currently in preclinical and clinical development, one of which is in later stage clinical development and does not show disease-modifying potential, while the other product candidates are in preclinical stages and have yet to demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept.
 

Our Approach
 
Our DM1 program is based on GeneTACTM small molecule candidates consisting of a DNA-targeting moiety designed to target to the CTG repeats in the 3’ untranslated region of the DMPK gene, linked to a ligand moiety that is designed to block transcription of the mutant expanded CTG repeat without disrupting the normal DMPK expression. As a result, the DM1 GeneTACTM molecule is designed to prevent the formation of the CUG hairpin structures that trap splicing proteins and produce nuclear foci. Like our FA program, the DM1 program is designed to address the underlying cause of the disease and benefit from the favorable development advantages of small molecules.
Preclinical Data
 
We are currently conducting preclinical studies of our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules in DM1 patient cells. We have observed reduced nuclear foci in DM1 cells from multiple patients after administration of our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules. We believe these data support the potential for our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules to be evaluated in clinical trials as a potential therapy for patients with DM1.
 
In preclinical studies in DM1 patient cells that contained toxic nuclear DMPK RNA, we observed reduction of nuclear foci following exposure to our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules. When toxic nuclear DMPK levels are reduced, the nuclear foci are diminished, releasing splicing proteins, allowing restoration of normal mRNA processing, and potentially stopping or reversing disease progression. As illustrated in Figure 10, we observed a reduction in CUG nuclear foci in DM1 patient cells exposed to our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules as determined through a fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging and analysis. This reduction was seen within several days after exposure to our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules. The reduced CUG nuclear foci are indicated by the reduction in green punctate staining.
 
Figure 10: Decrease in CUG nuclear foci in DM1 patient cells exposed to DM1 GeneTACTM molecules
 


In preclinical studies in cells from multiple DM1 patients, we observed a reduction in the number of observable CUG nuclear foci after exposure to our DM1 GeneTACTM molecule. As seen in Figure 11, after exposing DM1 Patient 1 and 2 cells to our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules, we observed an increase in the percentage of cells with no observable CUG nuclear foci to over 92%, similar to healthy cells.
 

Figure 11: CUG nuclear foci in cells from multiple DM1 patients
 


Figure 12: Percent splicing correction for MBNL1 exon 7 inclusion in DM1 patient fibroblasts
 


DM1 GeneTACTM molecules corrected splicing defects in MBNL-1 transcript in DM1 myoblasts and restored the splicing levels to >90% of that seen in healthy human skeletal myoblasts (Figure 12). We plan to continue evaluating the properties of our DM1 GeneTACTM molecules in both in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies and submit an IND in 2024.
 

Discovery Programs
 
We are also advancing our GeneTACTM portfolio in other serious nucleotide repeat expansion-driven monogenic diseases, such as fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia as outlined in the table below. Many of these monogenic diseases have overlapping triplet repeat expansions, including CTG repeats that cause DM1, allowing for the accumulating knowledge on how to design novel molecules to be applied across multiple diseases, also caused by CTG and CAG repeat expansions. Additionally, our medicinal chemistry experiences with GeneTACTM molecules allow us to more rapidly design GeneTACTM molecules for additional indications.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully design, develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in the field of nucleotide repeat expansion diseases and small molecules, and foundational intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
Friedreich Ataxia. On February 28, 2023, Reata Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA approved omaveloxolone, a Nrf2 activator, for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. We are also aware of a number of companies with active clinical stage FA programs including (i) Larimar Therapeutics evaluating CTI-1601, a cell penetrating peptide FXN recombinant fusion protein, (ii) Lexeo Therapeutics evaluating a cardiac targeted FXN gene therapy, (iii) Minoryx Therapeutics evaluating leriglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist, and (iv) PTC Therapeutics evaluating vatiquinone, a 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor. In addition, several companies have stated that they have gene therapy programs for FA including Lacerta Therapeutics, Novartis, Pfizer, PTC Therapeutics, Solid Biosciences, StrideBio, and Voyager Therapeutics.
 
Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy. We are aware of a number of companies with active clinical stage FECD programs including (i) Aurion Biotech evaluating Vyznova, expanded donor cells for transplant, (ii) Emmecell evaluating donor cornea endothelial cells delivered through magnetic nanoparticles injected into the anterior chamber, (iii) Kowa Pharmaceutical evaluating Ripasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, for use in conjunction with corneal surgery, (iv) Santen Pharmaceutical evaluating STN1010904, an mTOR inhibitor, and (v) Trefoil Therapeutics evaluating TTHX1114, an engineered FGF1 delivered via intracameral injection, for use in conjunction with corneal surgery.


Myotonic Dystrophy Type-1. We are aware of a number of programs for DM1 including (i) AMO Pharma evaluating tideglusib, a GSK3-ß inhibitor, (ii) small molecules interacting with RNA under evaluation by Anima Biotech, (iii) anti-miRNA oligonucleotides under evaluation by Arthex Biotech, (iv) Astellas Pharma evaluating an AAV-antisense candidate, (v) Avidity Biosciences evaluating an antibody linked siRNA, (vi) Dyne Therapeutics evaluating an antibody linked oligonucleotide, (vii) Entrada Therapeutics evaluating a peptide conjugated oligonucleotide, (viii) an AAV-based RNA degrading gene therapy by Enzerna Biosciences, (ix) small molecules interacting with RNA under evaluation by Expansion Therapeutics, (x) Harmony Biosciences evaluating a histamine 3 receptor for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in DM1, (xi) an RNA-targeting AAV-based gene therapy by Locanabio, (xii) PepGen evaluating a peptide conjugated antisense oligonucleotide, and (xiii) gene editing treatments by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
 
Other Nucleotide Repeat Expansion Driven Diseases. There are currently no approved therapies targeting the underlying cause of other inherited nucleotide repeat expansion diseases where we believe GeneTACTM molecules could have applicability, including fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, among others.
 
We will also compete more generally with other companies developing product candidates that utilize alternative scientific and technological approaches to modulate individual genes, including other companies working to develop nuclease-based gene editing technologies, such as Beam Therapeutics, CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences and Sangamo Biosciences.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated within a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety profile, biodistribution, manufacturability, effectiveness of commercial activities, intellectual property protection and availability of reimbursement.
 

License Agreement
 
License Agreement with Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation
 
On February 20, 2019, we and Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) entered into a human therapeutics exclusive license agreement (the WARF License Agreement), pursuant to which we received (i) an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain of WARF’s patents relating to compounds and methods for treating genetic disease by modulating gene expression, including expression of frataxin, through nucleic acid binding moieties that specifically bind to one or more repeats of a target oligonucleotide sequence as well as a synthetic transcription factor having a nucleic acid binding moiety that specifically binds to a target oligonucleotide sequence and (ii) a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of WARF’s know-how relating to the foregoing patents, in each case (i) and (ii), to research, develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, have sold, export and import products developed through the use of such licensed patents and know-how in all fields. We are currently using the licensed patents and know-how in our FA program. The licenses granted pursuant to the WARF License Agreement are subject to certain rights retained by (i) the United States government under the Bayh-Dole Act and (ii) WARF to grant the University of Wisconsin, non-profit research institutions collaborating with the University of Wisconsin and governmental agencies non-exclusive licenses to practice and use the licensed patents for non-commercial research purposes. Such rights retained by the United States government and WARF are typical for a license from a U.S. university or research institution, and we believe such rights do not pose a material risk to our business. We further granted to WARF, the University of Wisconsin, the inventors of the licensed patents, and governmental research organizations a covenant not to sue under certain improvements to the licensed patents for non-commercial research purposes. Under the WARF License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable diligence to develop, seek regulatory approval for, manufacture, market and sell licensed products throughout the term of the agreement, including satisfying certain funding and diligence milestones.
 
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the WARF License Agreement, we paid WARF an upfront licensing fee of $250,000 and a milestone fee of $125,000 following the submission of our IND for DT-216. We are also required to pay WARF up to an aggregate of $17.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercial sales milestones. Each such milestone payment is payable once for each licensed product for which the milestone is achieved, except for the two milestones relating to IND submission and human proof of concept study, which are payable only for the first licensed product for which such milestones are achieved (and not for subsequent licensed products). In addition, we are required to pay WARF, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon first commercial product sale, a fixed royalty of a low single digit percentage on sales of licensed products by us and/or by our sublicensees, subject to certain reductions and a minimum total annual royalty payment of $100,000. Our royalty obligation will terminate on the date of expiration of the last-to-expire of the licensed patents in the relevant country. We are also obligated to pay WARF sublicense fees in the mid-single digits percentage for funding or royalties earned from the granting of sublicenses to the WARF patents and know-how. We are required to reimburse WARF for all costs associated with filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents prior to and after the effective date of the WARF License Agreement.
 
The WARF License Agreement will continue until the earliest of (i) the date of early termination in accordance with the agreement, (ii) expiration of the licensed patents in all countries, or (iii) our cessation, once begun, of royalty payments for more than two years. The WARF License Agreement may be terminated by us upon 90 days’ written notice, provided we include a statement of reasons for termination. WARF may terminate the WARF License Agreement (a) upon written notice if our cumulative earned royalties paid to WARF does not exceed $0.1 million on or before December 31, 2031, (b) if we fail to make timely payments, fail to timely provide development reports or provide any false information with respect thereto, fail to actively pursue the development plan, or commit any breach of any other covenant, representation or warranty under the WARF License Agreement, in each case, without curing such failure or breach within 90 days after written notice thereof, (c) if we commit any act of bankruptcy or become insolvent, or (d) immediately if we or our sublicensee(s) offer any rights to the licensed patents to our or our sublicensees’ creditors. As of December 31, 2022, the licensed patents include one issued U.S. patent that is projected to expire on or around March 29, 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. The license also includes seven pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Any patents that issue from these patent applications have projected expiration dates from 2037 through 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available.
 

Manufacturing
 
GeneTACTM molecules are synthetically tractable, offering a readily scalable, cost-effective development path that does not require complex customized equipment and processes. We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) manufacturing facilities and laboratories. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the raw materials and starting components used to make our GeneTACTM molecules, and we expect to continue to do so to meet our research and development and commercial activities. Our third-party manufacturers are qualified to manufacture our product candidates under cGMP requirements and other applicable laws, guidances and regulations. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials and components required for the manufacture of our product candidates.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we own 19 pending U.S. patent applications, eight pending European patent applications, two pending patent applications in Argentina, two pending patent applications in Taiwan, a pending patent application in Canada, China, and Japan, respectively, and three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, which, if issued (or in case of provisional applications, if issued from future non-provisional applications that we file), are expected to expire between 2039 and 2043, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. In addition, we acquired an exclusive license from WARF under one issued U.S. patent, three pending U.S. patent applications, one pending European patent application, two pending Canadian patent applications and one pending Australian patent application, with the issued patent expected to expire in 2037 and the other patents, if issued, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. These patents cover our proprietary GeneTACTM Platform technology that is used in our FA program, DM1 program and other therapeutic programs directed to genetic diseases that are further discussed below.
 
For our FA program, as of December 31, 2022, we own or hold an exclusive, worldwide license from WARF. In particular, we have licensed from WARF an issued U.S. patent, a pending U.S. patent application, and a pending patent application in Europe and Canada, respectively, directed to compounds and methods for modulating frataxin expression and treatment of FA. The U.S. patent and any patents issued from these pending patent applications are projected to expire on or around March 29, 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. We also license from WARF one pending U.S. patent application and two pending patent applications in Australia and Canada directed to methods and other compounds for treatment of FA. Any patents that eventually issue from this patent application are projected to expire on or around October 22, 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. Additionally, we own nine pending U.S. patent applications, two pending patent applications in Europe, Argentina and Taiwan, respectively, a pending patent application in Canada, China, and Japan, respectively, and a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application directed to other compositions of matter and methods for the treatment of FA. Any patents that eventually issue from these patent applications are projected to expire in the 2039-2043 timeframe, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available.
 
For our FECD program, as of December 31, 2022, we own three U.S. patent applications, a pending patent application in Europe, and a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application directed to compositions of matter and methods for the treatment of FECD. Any patents issuing from these patent applications are projected to expire in 2043, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available.
 

For our DM1 program, as of December 31, 2022, two of our pending U.S. patent applications, one pending patent application in Europe, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application are directed to compositions of matter and methods for the treatment of DM1. Any patents issuing from patent applications in these families are projected to expire in the 2039-2043 timeframe, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available.
 
As of December 31, 2022, nine of our pending U.S. patent applications, seven of our pending patent applications in Europe and a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application are directed to our therapeutic programs related to other genetic diseases (including, but not limited to, fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia) and the development of potential disease-modifying compounds. These therapeutic programs and the development of potential disease-modifying compounds utilize our GeneTACTM Platform technology and any patents that issue from these patent applications are projected to expire in the 2039-2043 timeframe not including any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also license from WARF a pending U.S. patent application that, if issued, is projected to expire on or around March 29, 2038, not including any patent term adjustments or extensions. These patent applications cover compositions of matter and methods of treating the related genetic diseases under our therapeutic programs, including the use of transcription modulator molecules that contain a DNA-binding moiety capable of specifically binding to certain nucleotide repeat sequences that are implicated in the applicable genetic disease. In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We are a party to the WARF License Agreement, described in more detail above, under which we are granted intellectual property rights to know-how that are important to our business.
 
We also seek to protect our intellectual property by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with companies with whom we share proprietary and confidential information in the course of business discussions, and by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them while in our employ.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
As a pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Product candidates that we develop must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and implementing regulations. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (NDA) process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and other applicable regulations;
 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good clinical practice (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
 
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
 
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 
•potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA to assess compliance with GCP regulations;
 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP requirements. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 
•Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 
•Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage and clinical efficacy at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the Pediatric Research Equity Act does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendations.
 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or (an) additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
 

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, the FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required clinical trials, or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 
A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes intensive FDA interaction and guidance. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug. Breakthrough therapy designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
 
Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, such designations or shortened review periods may not provide a material commercial advantage.
 

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long term stability of the drug product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we are and, upon approval and commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
The federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim under the False Claims Act includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act can be enforced through private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.


In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Data Privacy and Security
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and regulations implemented thereunder, imposes obligations on “covered entities,” including certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” and covered subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, whether as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
 
In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosure to consumers about such business’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provide consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), was approved by California voters on November 3, 2020 and went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies significantly the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Both the CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how they are interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 

We also are or will become subject to applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we are established or in which we sell or market our products or run clinical trials. For example, if we conduct EU-based clinical trials, we will be subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in relation to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data of EU-based data subjects (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to participants in our clinical trials in the European Economic Area (EEA), including the health and medical data of these participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each EU and EEA Member State, however, it provides that EU and EEA Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, control, process and otherwise use and share personal data (including health and medical data), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing activities and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal data is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to EU rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EU and EEA. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EU's standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR, and we maintain an office in Switzerland, which has its own set of stringent privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, or potential civil claims including class action type litigation.
 
Further, the United Kingdom (UK)’s withdrawal from the EU and the EEA has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. Specifically, while the Data Protection Act of 2018, which implements and complements the GDPR in the UK, it is uncertain how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated in the long term. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision permitting flows of personal data between the EU and the UK to continue without additional requirements. The UK Government also adopted a reciprocal adequacy decision in respect of EEA member states permitting flows of personal data from the UK to the EEA. However, the European Commission’s UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/extends that decision and remains under review by the European Commission during this period.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
 

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. For gene therapy and other products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
If we elect to participate in certain governmental programs, we may be required to participate in discount and rebate programs, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. For example, drug manufacturers participating under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively ACA), was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 

Among the ACA’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
 
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
 
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP);
 
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
 
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
 
There have been executive judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which, among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how any additional challenges or additional healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA or our business.
 

Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, additional federal regulations, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
 
Recently, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent congressional inquiries and legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control costs pharmaceutical and biological products. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.
 
We anticipate that these new laws will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, health reform initiatives may arise in the future.
 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we or our potential collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of an application for a clinical trial authorization (CTA) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an application made to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a favorable ethics committee opinion has been issued, clinical trial development may proceed.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials are to a significant extent harmonized at the EU level, but could vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The way clinical trials are conducted in the EU will undergo a major change when the Clinical Trial Regulation (Regulation (EU No 536/2014) comes into application, expected in 2022.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures. The application used to file an NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, but the exact requirements for authorization may vary.
 
Centralized Procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases, other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for other products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health or which contain a new active substance for indications other than those specified to be compulsory.
 
National Authorization Procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 
•Decentralized Procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU Member State of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 
•Mutual Recognition Procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.



The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 
The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition in the EU and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the investment required to develop the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free or reduced-fee protocol assistance, fee reductions for marketing authorization applications and other post-authorization activities and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
In the European Union, early access mechanisms for innovative medicines (such as compassionate use programs and named patient supplies), pricing and reimbursement, and promotion and advertising, amongst other things, are subject to national regulations and oversight by national competent authorities and therefore significantly vary from country to country.
 
Sanctions for non-compliance with the aforementioned requirements, which may include administrative and criminal penalties, are generally determined and enforced at national level. However, under the EU financial penalties regime, the EMA can investigate and report on alleged breaches of the EU pharmaceutical rules by holders of a marketing authorization for centrally authorized medicinal products and the European Commission could adopt decisions imposing significant financial penalties on infringing marketing authorization holders.
 
The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Following the transition period which ended on December 31, 2020, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom in the coming years.
 
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
