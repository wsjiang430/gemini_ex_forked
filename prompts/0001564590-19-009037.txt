ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

Overview 
 Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), was formed on January 8, 2013 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in self storage facilities. The Company’s year-end is December 31. As used in this report, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Company” refer to Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. and each of our subsidiaries. 
 SmartStop Asset Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”) organized in 2013, was the sponsor of our Offering of shares of common stock, as described below. Our Sponsor is a company focused on providing real estate advisory, asset management, and property management services. Our Sponsor owns 97.5% of the economic interests (and 100% of the voting membership interests) of Strategic Storage Advisor II, LLC (our “Advisor”) and owns 100% of Strategic Storage Property Management II, LLC (the “T2 Property Manager”). In addition, as a result of the SSGT Merger (defined below), certain of our properties are managed by SS Growth Property Management, LLC, which is also 100% owned by our Sponsor (the “GT Property Manager” and together with the T2 Property Manager, our “Property Manager”). See the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Transaction and Director Independence—Certain Relationships and Related Transaction—Property Management Agreements,” below, for more information.
 On October 1, 2015, SmartStop Self Storage, Inc. (“SmartStop”) and Extra Space Storage Inc. (“Extra Space”), along with subsidiaries of each of SmartStop and Extra Space, closed on a merger transaction (the “Extra Space Merger”) in which SmartStop was acquired by Extra Space for $13.75 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of approximately $1.4 billion. At the closing of the Extra Space Merger, our Sponsor was sold to an entity controlled by H. Michael Schwartz, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and became our sponsor. The former executive management team of SmartStop continues to serve as the executive management team for our Sponsor. In addition, the majority of our management team at the time of the Extra Space Merger continues to serve on our management team, as well as the management team of our Advisor and Property Manager. 
 We have no employees. Our Advisor, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on January 8, 2013. Our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and identifying and making acquisitions and investments on our behalf under the terms of the advisory agreement we have with our Advisor (our “Advisory Agreement”). The officers of our Advisor, as well as a majority of the officers of our Sponsor, are also officers of us. 
 Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, authorized 350,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Class A Shares”) and 350,000,000 shares of Class T common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Class T Shares”) and 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001. We offered a maximum of $1.0 billion in common shares for sale to the public (the “Primary Offering”) and $95.0 million in common shares for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (collectively, the “Offering”). 
 On January 10, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declared our registration statement effective. On May 23, 2014, we satisfied the $1.5 million minimum offering requirements of our Offering and commenced formal operations. On January 9, 2017, our Offering terminated. We sold approximately 48 million Class A Shares and approximately 7 million Class T Shares for approximately $493 million and $73 million respectively, in our Offering. On November 30, 2016, prior to the termination of our Offering, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which registered up to an additional $100.9 million in shares under our distribution reinvestment plan (our “DRP Offering”). The DRP Offering may be terminated at any time upon 10 days’ prior written notice to stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, we had sold approximately 2.7 million Class A Shares and approximately 0.4 million Class T Shares for approximately $27.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in our DRP Offering.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned 83 self storage properties located in 14 states and Ontario, Canada (the Greater Toronto Area). 
 On April 19, 2018, our board of directors, upon recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $10.65 for our Class A Shares and Class T Shares based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated as of December 31, 2017. See Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Market Information, for a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine, and the limitations of, the estimated value per share.

As a result of the calculation of our estimated value per share, beginning in May 2018, shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan are being sold at the estimated value per share of $10.65 for both Class A Shares and Class T Shares. 
 Our operating partnership, Strategic Storage Operating Partnership II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (our “Operating Partnership”), was formed on January 9, 2013. During 2013, our Advisor purchased limited partnership interests in our Operating Partnership for $200,000 and on August 2, 2013, we contributed the initial $1,000 capital contribution we received to our Operating Partnership in exchange for the general partner interest. In conjunction with the Toronto Merger (as defined in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) we issued an aggregate of approximately 483,197 Class A Units of our Operating Partnership to the common stockholders of Strategic Storage Toronto Properties REIT, Inc. (“SS Toronto”), consisting of Strategic 1031, LLC (“Strategic 1031”), a subsidiary of our Sponsor, and SS Toronto REIT Advisors, Inc., an affiliate of our Sponsor. Our Operating Partnership owns, directly or indirectly through one or more special purpose entities, all of the self storage properties that we have acquired and the self storage properties we will acquire in the future. On October 1, 2018, in conjunction with the amalgamation of our Canadian entities, Strategic 1031 exchanged 483,124 Class A Units of our Operating Partnership and received 483,124 shares of our Class A common stock.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 99.96% of the common units of limited partnership interests of our Operating Partnership. The remaining approximately 0.04% of the common units are owned by our Advisor, and SS Toronto REIT Advisors, Inc. As the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of our Operating Partnership. We conduct certain activities through our taxable REIT subsidiary, Strategic Storage TRS II, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “TRS”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership.  
 On October 1, 2018, we entered into a merger agreement with Strategic Storage Growth Trust, Inc., or SSGT, which we refer to as the SSGT Merger. The SSGT Merger was approved by SSGT's stockholders on January 18, 2019, and it was completed on January 24, 2019. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Events—Merger with Strategic Storage Growth Trust, Inc., for additional information related to the SSGT Merger.
 The T2 Property Manager was formed on January 8, 2013, and the GT Property Manager was formed on March 12, 2013. Our Property Manager derives substantially all of its income from the property management services it performs for us. Our Property Manager may enter into sub-property management agreements with third party management companies and pay part of its management fee to such sub-property manager. From October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2017, our Property Manager contracted with Extra Space for Extra Space to serve as the sub-property manager for each of our properties located in the United States pursuant to separate sub-property management agreements for each property.  
 On October 1, 2017, our Property Manager terminated the sub-property management agreements with Extra Space and our Property Manager began managing all of our United States properties directly. In connection therewith, an affiliate of our Property Manager reacquired the rights to the “SmartStop® Self Storage” brand in the United States. As a result, we also began using the “SmartStop® Self Storage” brand at our United States properties effective October 1, 2017. For more information, please see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
 All properties owned or acquired in Canada are managed by a subsidiary of our Sponsor and are branded using the SmartStop® Self Storage brand.
 Our dealer manager is Select Capital Corporation, a California corporation (our “Dealer Manager”). Our Dealer Manager was responsible for marketing our shares offered pursuant to our Primary Offering. Our Sponsor owns a 15% non-voting equity interest in our Dealer Manager. Affiliates of our Dealer Manager own a 2.5% non-voting membership interest in our Advisor. 
 Our Sponsor owns 100% of the membership interests of Strategic Transfer Agent Services, LLC, our transfer agent (our “Transfer Agent”). On May 31, 2018, the Company executed an agreement (the “Transfer Agent Agreement”), with our Transfer Agent to provide transfer agent and registrar services to us that are substantially similar to what a third party transfer agent would provide in the ordinary course of performing its functions as a transfer agent. Our Transfer Agent may retain and supervise third party vendors in its efforts to administer certain services. Please see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements – Related Party Transactions – Transfer Agent Agreement.

As we accepted subscriptions for shares of our common stock, we transferred all of the net offering proceeds to our Operating Partnership as capital contributions in exchange for additional units of interest in our Operating Partnership. However, we were deemed to have made capital contributions in the amount of gross proceeds received from investors, and our Operating Partnership was deemed to have simultaneously paid the sales commissions and other costs associated with the Offering. In addition, our Operating Partnership is structured to make distributions with respect to limited partnership units that are equivalent to the distributions made to holders of common stock. Finally, a limited partner in our Operating Partnership may later exchange his or her limited partnership units in our Operating Partnership for shares of our common stock at any time after one year following the date of issuance of their limited partnership units, subject to certain restrictions outlined in our Operating Partnership’s limited partnership agreement (the “Operating Partnership Agreement”). Our Advisor is prohibited from exchanging or otherwise transferring its limited partnership units so long as it is acting as our Advisor pursuant to our Advisory Agreement.
 Industry Summary 
 “Self storage” refers to properties that offer do-it-yourself, month-to-month storage unit rental for personal or business use. Self storage offers a cost-effective and flexible storage alternative. Customers rent fully-enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs. Customers typically have access to their storage units from 6:00AM – 10:00PM (365 days per year), and some of our facilities provide 24-hour access. Customers have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units. Self storage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 10 feet by 30 feet. 
 Self storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions, whether due to a life change or simply because of a need for extra storage space. According to the 2019 Self Storage Almanac, self storage facilities generally have a customer mix of approximately 77% residential, 19% commercial, 2% military and 2% students. The mix of residential customers using a self storage property is determined by a property’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or who are not yet settled in a large home. The items that residential customers place in self storage properties range from furniture, household items and appliances to cars, boats and recreational vehicles. Commercial customers tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records or extra inventory, or storage for seasonal goods. Self storage properties provide an accessible storage alternative at a relatively low cost. Properties generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing customers with assistance as needed. 
 The six key demand drivers of self storage are: (1) population growth; (2) percentage of renter-occupied housing units; (3) average household size; (4) average household income; (5) supply constraints; and (6) economic growth. Customers choose a self storage property based largely on the convenience of the site to their home or business. Therefore, high-density, high-traffic population centers are ideal locations for a self storage property. A property’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to secure rentals. Although most self storage units are leased to customers on a month-to-month basis, customers tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time. However, there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for self storage properties. Generally, there is increased leasing activity at self storage properties during the late spring and early summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period. 
 As population densities have increased in the U.S., there has been an increase in self storage awareness and development. According to the 2019 Self Storage Almanac:
  
• | at the end of 2018 there were 45,547 self storage facilities in the U.S.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at the end of 2017 there were 44,149 self storage facilities in the U.S.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at the end of 2016 there were 41,879 self storage facilities in the U.S.; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at the end of 2015 there were 41,443 self storage facilities in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The growth in the industry has created more competition in various geographic regions. This has led to an increased emphasis on site location, property design, innovation and functionality to accommodate local planning and zoning boards and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market. This is especially true for new sites slated for high-density population centers. 
 4

Self storage operators have placed increased emphasis on offering ancillary products that provide incremental revenues. Moving and packing supplies, such as locks and boxes, and the offering of other services, such as tenant insurance and truck rentals, help to increase revenues. As more sophisticated self storage operators continue to develop innovative products and services such as online rentals, 24-hour accessibility, climate-controlled storage, wine storage, customer-service call center access and after-hours storage, local operators may be increasingly unable to meet higher customer expectations, which could encourage consolidation in the industry. 
 We also believe that the self storage industry possesses attractive characteristics not found in other commercial real estate sectors, including the following: 
  
• | no reliance on a “single large customer” whose vacating can have a devastating impact on rental revenue;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no leasing commissions and/or tenant improvements;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | relatively low capital expenditures;
--+-------------------------------------


• | brand names can be developed at local, regional and even national levels;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | opportunity for a great deal of geographic diversification, which could enhance the stability and predictability of cash flows; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the lowest loan default rate of any commercial property type.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Business Overview 
 Unlike many other REITs and real estate companies, we are an operating business. We acquire, own, operate and manage self storage facilities. Our self storage facilities offer inexpensive, easily accessible, enclosed storage units or parking spaces to residential and commercial users on a month-to-month basis. Most of our facilities are fenced with computerized gates and well lighted. Many of our properties are single-story, thereby providing customers with the convenience of direct vehicle access to their storage units. At certain facilities, we offer climate controlled units that offer heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. Many of our facilities also offer outside vehicle, boat and recreational vehicle storage areas. Our facilities are generally constructed of masonry or steel walls resting on concrete slabs and have standing seam metal, shingle, or tar and gravel roofs. Customers typically have access to their storage units from 6:00 AM – 10:00 PM, and some of our facilities provide 24-hour access. Individual storage units are secured by a lock furnished by the customer to provide the customer with control of access to the space. 
 As an operating business, self storage requires a much greater focus on strategic planning and tactical operation plans. As we have grown our portfolio of self storage facilities, we have been able to consolidate and streamline a number of aspects of our operations through economies of scale. For example, our size and geographic diversification, as well as institution of a blanket property and casualty insurance program over all properties managed by our Property Manager nationwide, reduces our total insurance costs per property. As we acquire facilities, increased diversification further mitigates against risk and reduces the cost of insurance per property. To the extent we acquired facilities in clusters within geographic regions, we see property management efficiencies resulting in reduction of personnel and other administrative costs. 
 Investment Objectives 
 Overview 
 We have invested a substantial amount of the net proceeds of the Offering and will continue to invest cash from operations in self storage facilities and related self storage real estate investments. We may also use such amounts to pay down debt or make distributions. We may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions. Our investment objectives, strategy and policies may be amended or changed at any time by our board of directors. Although we have no plans at this time to change any of our investment objectives, our board of directors may change any and all such investment objectives, including our focus on self storage facilities, if our board believes such changes are in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, we may invest in real estate properties other than self storage facilities if our board deems such investments to be in the best interests of our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that our policies or investment objectives will be attained or that the value of our common stock will not decrease. 
 5

Primary Investment Objectives 
 Our primary investment objectives are to: 
  
• | invest in income-producing real property in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | preserve and protect our stockholders’ invested capital;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | achieve appreciation in the value of our properties over the long term; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | grow net cash flow from operations in order to provide sustainable cash distributions to our stockholders over the long-term.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We cannot assure our stockholders that we will attain these primary investment objectives. 
 Liquidity Events 
 Subject to then-existing market conditions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we intend to seek one or more of the following liquidity events within three to five years after completion of our Primary Offering: 

• | merge, reorganize or otherwise transfer our company or its assets to another entity with listed securities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commence the sale of all of our properties and liquidate our company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | list our shares on a national securities exchange; or
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | otherwise create a liquidity event for our stockholders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 However, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will achieve one or more of the above-described liquidity events within the time frame contemplated or at all. This time frame represents our best faith estimate of the time necessary to build a portfolio sufficient enough to effectuate one of the liquidity events listed above. Our charter does not require us to pursue a liquidity transaction at any time. Our board of directors has the sole discretion to continue operations beyond five years after completion of the Offering if it deems such continuation to be in the best interests of our stockholders. Even if we do accomplish one or more of these liquidity events, we cannot guarantee that a public market will develop for the securities listed or that such securities will trade at a price higher than what was paid for shares in our Offering. At the time it becomes necessary for our board of directors to determine which liquidity event, if any, is in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we expect that the board will take all relevant factors at that time into consideration when making a liquidity event decision. We expect that the board will consider various factors including, but not limited to, costs and expenses related to each possible liquidity event and the potential subordinated distributions payable to our Advisor. 
 Our Self Storage Acquisition Strategy 
 We focus on investing in a portfolio of income-producing self storage facilities and related self storage real estate investments that are expected to support sustainable stockholder distributions over the long term. In order to implement our investment strategy, we focus on income-producing self storage facilities located in primary and secondary markets. Many of these facilities have stabilized occupancy rates greater than 75%, but have the opportunity for higher economic occupancy due to the property management capabilities of our Property Manager. 
 We may make investments in mortgage loans secured by self storage facilities, including but not limited to, senior, mezzanine, or subordinated loans. We may also invest in self storage facilities internationally. 
 Self Storage Focus 
 “Self storage” refers to properties that offer do-it-yourself, month-to-month storage unit rental for personal or business use. The self storage industry is highly fragmented, comprised mainly of local operators and a few national owners and operators, including, we believe, only seven publicly traded self storage REITs. As a result of the track record of our Sponsor and its affiliates in investing in self storage facilities, our experienced management team and the fragmented nature of the self storage industry, we believe there is a significant opportunity for us to achieve market penetration in our markets. 
 6

We focus on pursuing investments in self storage facilities and related self storage real estate investments in markets with varying economic and demographic characteristics, including large urban cities, densely populated suburban cities and smaller rural cities, as long as the property meets our acquisition criteria described below under “General Acquisition and Investment Policies.” We also expand and develop certain facilities we purchase in order to capitalize on underutilization and excess demand. The development of certain facilities we purchase may include an expansion of the self storage units or the services and ancillary products offered as well as making units available for office space. Future investments will not be limited to any geographic area, to a type of facility or to a specified percentage of our total assets. We strategically invest in specific domestic or foreign markets when opportunities that meet our investment criteria are available. In general, when evaluating potential acquisitions of self storage facilities, the primary factor we consider is the property’s current and projected cash flow. 
 General Acquisition and Investment Policies 
 While we focus our investment strategy on self storage facilities and related self storage real estate investments, we may invest in other storage-related investments such as storage facilities for automobiles, recreation vehicles and boats. We may additionally invest in other types of commercial real estate properties if our board of directors deems appropriate; however, we have no current intention of investing more than 20% of the net proceeds of our Offering in such other commercial real estate properties. We seek to make investments that will satisfy the primary investment objective of providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders. However, because a significant factor in the valuation of income-producing real property is its potential for future appreciation, some properties we acquire may have the potential for both growth in value and for providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific properties. However, each acquisition is approved by our board of directors. The consideration paid for a property will ordinarily be based on the fair market value of the property as determined by a majority of our board of directors. In selecting a potential property for acquisition, we and our Advisor consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
  
• | projected demand for self storage facilities in the area;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | a property’s geographic location and type;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | a property’s physical location in relation to population density, traffic counts and access;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | construction quality and condition;
--+------------------------------------


• | potential for capital appreciation;
--+------------------------------------


• | proposed purchase price, terms and conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | historical financial performance;
--+----------------------------------


• | rental rates and occupancy levels for the property and competing properties in the area;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential for rent increases;
--+------------------------------


• | demographics of the area;
--+--------------------------


• | operating expenses being incurred and expected to be incurred, including, but not limited to property taxes and insurance costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential capital improvements and reserves required to maintain the property;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential for expanding the physical layout of the property;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the potential for the construction of new properties in the area;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | treatment under applicable federal, state and local tax and other laws and regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluation of title and impediments, if any, to obtaining satisfactory title insurance; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluation of any reasonably ascertainable risks such as environmental contamination.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire. The number and mix of properties will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition, such as our cash from operations or our ability to obtain financing. In determining whether to purchase a particular property, we may obtain an option on such property. The amount paid for an option, if any, is normally surrendered if the property is not purchased and may or may not be credited against the purchase price if the property is ultimately purchased. 
 Our Borrowing Strategy and Policies 
 Although we intend to use low leverage (less than 50% loan to purchase price) to make our investments, at certain times, our debt leverage levels may be temporarily higher. Our board of directors will regularly monitor our investment pipeline in relation to our projected fundraising efforts and otherwise evaluate market conditions related to our debt 
leverage ratios. 
 We may incur indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly- or privately-placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders. We may obtain a credit facility or a separate loan for certain acquisitions. Our indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our properties. We may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new properties, to pay for capital improvements, repairs or buildouts, to refinance existing indebtedness, to pay distributions, to fund redemptions of our shares or to provide working capital. 
 There is no limitation on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any property. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Our charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets, as defined, (approximately 75% of the cost basis of our assets), unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, with a justification for such excess. 
 We may borrow funds from our Advisor or its affiliates only if such loan is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive, commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties under 
the circumstances. 
 Except as set forth in our charter regarding debt limits, we may re-evaluate and change our debt strategy and policies in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we could consider when re-evaluating or changing our debt strategy and policies include then-current economic and market conditions, the relative cost of debt and equity capital, any acquisition opportunities, the ability of our properties to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to equity in connection with any change of our borrowing policies. 
 Acquisition Structure 
 Although we are not limited as to the form our investments may take, our investments in real estate will generally constitute acquiring fee title or interests in joint ventures or similar entities that own and operate real estate. We may also enter into the following types of leases relating to real property: 

• | a ground lease in which we enter into a long-term lease (generally greater than 30 years) with the owner for use of the property during the term whereby the owner retains title to the land; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a master lease in which we enter into a long-term lease (typically 10 years with multiple renewal options) with the owner in which we agree to pay rent to the owner and pay all costs of operating and maintaining the property (a net lease) and typically have an option to purchase the property in the future.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We make acquisitions of our real estate investments directly or indirectly through our Operating Partnership. We acquire interests in real estate either directly through our Operating Partnership or indirectly through limited liability companies or limited partnerships, or through investments in joint ventures. 
 8

Conditions to Closing Acquisitions 
 Generally, we will not purchase any property unless and until we obtain at least a Phase I environmental assessment and environmental history for each property purchased and we are sufficiently satisfied with the property’s environmental status. In addition, we will generally condition our obligation to close the purchase of any investment on the delivery and verification of certain documents from the seller or other independent professionals, including, but not limited to, 
where appropriate: 
  
• | appraisals, property surveys and site audits;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | building plans and specifications, if available;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | soil reports, seismic studies, flood zone studies, if available;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | licenses, permits, maps and governmental approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | historical financial statements and tax statement summaries of the properties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proof of marketable title, subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to us; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liability and title insurance policies.
--+----------------------------------------

Joint Venture Investments 
 We may enter into joint ventures, general partnerships, co-tenancies and other participations with real estate developers, owners and others for the purpose of owning and leasing real properties. Among other reasons, we may want to acquire properties through a joint venture with third parties or affiliates in order to diversify our portfolio of properties in terms of geographic region or property type or to co-invest with one of our property management partners. Joint ventures may also allow us to acquire an interest in a property without requiring that we fund the entire purchase price. In addition, certain properties may be available to us only through joint ventures. For example, from time to time we enter into joint venture arrangements with SmartCentres. For more information, please see Note 3—Real Estate Facilities—Joint Venture with SmartCentres.  In determining whether to recommend a particular joint venture, our Advisor will evaluate the real property which such joint venture owns or is being formed to own under the same criteria described elsewhere in this report. 
 We may enter into joint ventures with our Advisor or any affiliate thereof for the acquisition of properties, but only provided that: 
  
• | a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the investment by us and the joint venture partner are on substantially the same terms and conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To the extent possible and if approved by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, we will attempt to obtain a right of first refusal or option to buy if such venture partner elects to sell its interest in the joint venture entity or the property held by the joint venture. In the event that the venture partner were to elect to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the venture partner’s interest in the property held by the joint venture. Entering into joint ventures with affiliates of our Advisor will result in certain conflicts of interest. 
 Government Regulations 
 Our business is subject to many laws and governmental regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and courts, occur frequently. 
 9

Americans with Disabilities Act 
 Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Complying with the ADA requirements could require us to remove access barriers. Failing to comply could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. Although we intend to acquire properties that substantially comply with these requirements, we may incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. In addition, a number of additional federal, state and local laws may require us to modify any properties we purchase, or may restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access by disabled persons. Additional legislation could impose financial obligations or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons. Although we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on us, if required changes involve a greater amount of expenditures than we currently anticipate, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 
Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances. These laws often impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigating, removing or remediating these substances may be substantial, and the presence of these substances may adversely affect our ability to rent units or sell the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral, and may expose us to liability resulting from any release of or exposure to these substances. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location, we may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating these substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by us. We may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site that we own or operate. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. 
Other Regulations 
 The properties we acquire will be subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as zoning and state and local fire and life safety requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants. We intend to acquire properties that are in material compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, we cannot make assurances that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Disposition Policies 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had not disposed of any of our self storage facilities. We generally intend to hold each property we acquire for an extended period. However, we may sell a property at any time if, in our judgment, the sale of the property is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 The determination of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will generally be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, other investment opportunities and considerations specific to the condition, value and financial performance of the property. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. 
 We may sell assets to third parties or to affiliates of our Advisor. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, must review and approve all transactions between us and our Advisor and its affiliates.

Investment Limitations in Our Charter 
 Our charter places numerous limitations on us with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds, most of which are required by various provisions of the Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts published by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA REIT Guidelines). Pursuant to the NASAA REIT Guidelines we will not: 

• | Invest in equity securities unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approve such investment as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in commodities or commodity futures contracts, except for futures contracts when used solely for the purpose of hedging in connection with our ordinary business of investing in real estate assets and mortgages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in real estate contracts of sale, otherwise known as land sale contracts, unless the contract is in recordable form and is appropriately recorded in the chain of title.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make or invest in mortgage loans unless an appraisal is obtained concerning the underlying property, except for those mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by a government or government agency. In cases where our independent directors determine, and in all cases in which the transaction is with any of our directors or our Advisor and its affiliates, we will obtain an appraisal from an independent appraiser. We will maintain such appraisal in our records for at least five years and it will be available to our stockholders for inspection and duplication. We will also obtain a mortgagee’s or owner’s title insurance policy as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of the title.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make or invest in mortgage loans, including construction loans, on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans on such property would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of such property, as determined by an appraisal, unless substantial justification exists for exceeding such limit because of the presence of other loan underwriting criteria.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make or invest in mortgage loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of any of our directors, our Advisor or their respective affiliates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make investments in unimproved property or indebtedness secured by a deed of trust or mortgage loans on unimproved property in excess of 10% of our total assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue equity securities on a deferred payment basis or other similar arrangement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue debt securities in the absence of adequate cash flow to cover debt service.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue equity securities that are assessable after we have received the consideration for which our board of directors authorized their issuance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue “redeemable securities” redeemable solely at the option of the holder, which restriction has no effect on our ability to implement our share redemption program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grant warrants or options to purchase shares to our Advisor or its affiliates or to officers or directors affiliated with our Advisor except on the same terms as options or warrants that are sold to the general public. Further, the amount of the options or warrants cannot exceed an amount equal to 10% of outstanding shares on the date of grant of the warrants and options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lend money to our directors, or to our Advisor or its affiliates, except for certain mortgage loans described above.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Allocation Policy 
 In the event that an investment opportunity becomes available, our Sponsor will allocate such investment opportunity to us, private programs and/or Strategic Storage Trust IV, Inc., a public non-traded REIT sponsored by our sponsor (“SST IV”) based on the following factors: 

• | the investment objectives of each program;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | the amount of funds available to each program;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the financial and investment characteristics of each program, including investment size, potential leverage, transaction structure and anticipated cash flows;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | the strategic location of the investment in relationship to existing properties owned by each program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of the investment on the diversification of each program’s investments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the impact of the financial metrics of the investment, such as revenue per square foot, on each program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If, after consideration and analysis of these factors, the investment opportunity is suitable for us, SST IV, or another private program sponsored by our Sponsor, then: 
  
• | we will have priority for portfolios of properties with an aggregate purchase price of $150 million or more;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SST IV will have priority for (i) all individual stabilized properties and portfolios of properties, at least a majority of which (based on allocated purchase price) are stabilized, with aggregate purchase prices less than $150 million, and (ii) all joint venture development properties with SmartCentres Real Estate Investment Trust; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic Storage Growth Trust II, Inc., a private REIT sponsored by our sponsor (“SSGT II”), will have priority for all individual growth properties and portfolios of properties, at least a majority of which (based on allocated purchase price) are growth-oriented, with aggregate purchase prices less than $150 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event all acquisition allocation factors have been exhausted and an investment opportunity remains suitable for two or more of us, private programs, or SST IV, then our Sponsor will offer the investment opportunity to the program that has had the longest period of time elapse since it was offered an investment opportunity. It will be the duty of our board of directors, including the independent directors, to ensure that this method is applied fairly to us.
 Changes in Investment Policies and Limitations 
 Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interests of our stockholders. Each determination and the basis therefor is required to be set forth in the applicable meeting minutes. The methods of implementing our investment policies may also vary as new investment techniques are developed. The methods of implementing our investment objectives and policies, except as otherwise provided in our charter, may be altered by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders. The determination by our board of directors that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to be qualified as a REIT shall require the concurrence of two-thirds of the board of directors. Investment policies and limitations specifically set forth in our charter, however, may only be amended by a vote of the stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares. 
Investments in Mortgage Loans 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had not invested in any mortgages. While we intend to emphasize equity real estate investments and, hence, operate as what is generally referred to as an “equity REIT,” as opposed to a “mortgage REIT,” we may invest in first or second mortgage loans, mezzanine loans secured by an interest in the entity owning the real estate or other similar real estate loans consistent with our REIT status. We may make such loans to developers in connection with construction and redevelopment of self storage facilities. Such mortgages may or may not be insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration or another third party. We may also invest in participating or convertible mortgages if our directors conclude that we and our stockholders may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the subject property. Such mortgages are similar to equity participation. 
Investment Company Act of 1940 and Certain Other Policies 
 We intend to operate in such a manner that we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act. Our Advisor will continually review our investment activity to attempt to ensure that we do not come within the application of the 1940 Act. Among other things, our Advisor attempts to monitor the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in various investments so that we do not come within the definition of an “investment company” under the 1940 Act. If at any time the character of our investments could cause us to be deemed as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, we will take all necessary actions to attempt to ensure that we are not deemed to be an “investment company.” In addition, we do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers or actively trade in loans or other investments. 
 12

Subject to the restrictions we must follow in order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may make investments other than as previously described, although we do not currently intend to do so. We have authority to purchase or otherwise reacquire our common shares or any of our other securities. We have no present intention of repurchasing any of our common shares except pursuant to our share redemption program, and we would only take such action in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the requirements for qualifying as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 
 Employees 
 We have no employees. The employees of our Advisor and its affiliates provide management, acquisition, advisory and certain administrative services for us. 
 Competition 
 The extent of competition in a market area depends significantly on local market conditions. The primary factors upon which competition in the self storage industry is based are location, rental rates, suitability of the property’s design and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. We believe we will compete successfully on these bases. 
 Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. Such competitors may, among other possible advantages, be capable of paying higher prices for acquisitions and obtaining financing on better terms than us. 
 Industry Segments 
 We have internally evaluated all of our properties and interests therein as one industry segment and, accordingly, we do not report segment information.
