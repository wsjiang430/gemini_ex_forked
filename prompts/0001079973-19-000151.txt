Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
Lifeloc Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Lifeloc" or the "Company"), is a Colorado-based developer, manufacturer and marketer of portable hand-held and fixed station breathalyzers and related accessories, supplies and education.  We design, produce and sell fuel-cell based breath alcohol testing equipment.  We compete in all major segments of the portable breath alcohol testing instrument market, including law enforcement, workplace, corrections, original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") and consumer markets. In addition, we offer a line of supplies, accessories, services, and training to support customers' alcohol testing programs. We sell globally through distributors as well as directly to users.
 
We define our business as providing "near and remote sensing" products and solutions. Today, the majority of our revenues are derived from products and services for alcohol detection and measurement. We remain committed to growing our breath alcohol testing business. In the future, we anticipate the commercialization of new sensing and measurement products that may allow Lifeloc to successfully expand our business into new growth areas where we do not presently compete or where no satisfactory product solutions exist today.
 
In addition, with the October 2014 purchase of our corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property, we added a new reporting segment focused on the ownership and rental of real property through existing commercial leases.
 
Lifeloc incorporated in Colorado in December 1983.  We filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on May 31, 2011.  Our fiscal year end is December 31.  Our principal executive offices are located at 12441 West 49th Avenue, Unit 4, Wheat Ridge, Colorado 80033-3338.  Our telephone number is (303) 431-9500.  Our websites are www.lifeloc.com, www.stsfirst.com and lifeguardbreathtester.com.  Information contained on our websites does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.
 
Principal Products and Services and Methods of Distribution
 
Alcohol Breath Testers
 
In 1989, we introduced our first breath alcohol tester, the PBA3000. Our Phoenix® Classic was completed and released for sale in 1998, superseding the PBA3000. In turn, the Phoenix® Classic has been superseded by our FC Series and Workplace Series of portable breath alcohol testers, which are discussed below. Neither the PBA3000 nor the Phoenix® Classic is actively sold today.
 
In 2001, we completed and released for sale our new FC Series, designed specifically for domestic and international law enforcement and corrections markets. The portable breath alcohol testers comprising our FC Series are currently being sold worldwide, having contributed to our growth since their introduction. The FC Series is designed to meet the needs of domestic and international law enforcement for roadside drink/drive testing and alcohol offender monitoring. The FC Series is approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") as an evidential breath tester, making it suitable for sale to state law enforcement agencies for preliminary roadside breath alcohol testing.  The FC Series is routinely updated with firmware, software and component improvements as they become available.  It is readily adaptable to the specific requirements and regulations of domestic and international markets.

In 2005 and 2006, we introduced two new models, the EV30 and Phoenix® 6.0 Evidential Breath Tester ("Phoenix® 6.0"), which constitute our Workplace Series of testing devices.  Like their predecessor, the Phoenix® Classic, and our FC Series, these instruments are DOT approved. The DOT's specifications support the DOT's workplace alcohol testing programs, including those applicable to workplace alcohol testing for the federally regulated transportation industry. We also sell component parts used in alcohol testing devices, such as mouthpieces used by our breathalyzers, as well as forms and labels used for record keeping, and calibration products for user re-calibration of our devices.  We offer optional service agreements on our equipment, re-calibration services, and spare parts, and we sell supporting instrument training and user certification training to our workplace customers.
 
In 2006, we commenced selling breath alcohol equipment components that we manufacture to other OEMs for inclusion as subassemblies or components in their breath alcohol testing devices.
 
In late 2009, Lifeloc released the LifeGuard® Personal Breathalyzer ("LifeGuard®"), a personal alcohol breath tester that incorporates the same fuel-cell technology used in our professional devices.  Intended for the global consumer breathalyzer market, LifeGuard® is marketed internationally through global distributors.  
 
In 2011 and 2012 Lifeloc introduced Bluetooth wireless keyboard and printer communication options for our Phoenix® 6.0 along with a series of web based workplace training courses. We believe these two product innovations have been key to our success and leadership in workplace breath testing.
 
In 2013 Lifeloc expanded our FC Series of professional breath alcohol testers targeted at domestic and international law enforcement and corrections markets with the addition of the FC5 Hornet (the "FC5"). The FC5 is a passive (no mouthpieces required) portable handheld alcohol screening device that competes directly with passive alcohol screeners from our competitors in the education, law enforcement, workplace and corrections markets.
 
In 2013 we also introduced the Sentinel™ zero tolerance alcohol screening station, a fully automated wall mounted screening station for use in safety sensitive industries such as oil and gas and mining. Both devices expand Lifeloc's products for passive alcohol screening.
 
In the third quarter of 2014 we received approval from DOT for our EASYCAL® automatic calibration station for use with our Phoenix ® 6.0 Evidential Breath Testers, and we began shipments of the EASYCAL® to our law enforcement, corrections, workplace and international customers.   The EASYCAL® calibration station is a first of its kind device that automatically performs breath tester instrument calibration, calibration verification and gas management.  As compared to manual instrument calibration, the EASYCAL® reduces the opportunity for human error, saves time and reduces operating costs.  We anticipate submitting to the DOT for approval in the first quarter of 2019 a second generation EASYCAL® calibration station with broader capability.
 
In October 2015 we expanded our Sentinel™ line with the Sentinel™ VA alcohol screening station, a fully automated station to control vehicular access to safety critical facilities, such as mines, refineries, power stations and nuclear facilities.  With the Sentinel ™ VA alcohol screening station, all drivers entering a secure area can be tested quickly and efficiently without leaving their vehicle.
 
Testers for Drugs of Abuse
 
In October 2014 we were awarded a $250,000 grant from the Colorado Office of Economic Development to accelerate development of a breathalyzer that tests for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent in cannabis.  In 2016 the breathalyzer development effort was broadened to include the SpinDx™ technology as a potential detection method.  Terms of the grant required us to submit invoices as work was performed. We received $25,000, $42,396, $44,523 and $11,288 of grant reimbursements in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively.  The grant completion date was August 31, 2017, at which point $126,793 of grant funds remained unused and are no longer available.  Reimbursements received under the grant were included in our Statements of Income as reductions in Research and Development cost.  No revenue was recognized from these grant reimbursements.
 
In August 2016 we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with Sandia Corporation pursuant to which we acquired the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and market Sandia's patented SpinDx™ technology for the detection of drugs of abuse.  We believe this license agreement signifies the beginning of a relationship that may become material to the Company in the future.  A prototype was built by Sandia under our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement and received in 2017, after which we commenced work on commercializing the device.  SpinDx™ uses a centrifugal disk with micro fluidic flow paths allowing multiple tests to be carried out on a single small sample.  The SpinDx™ platform has the potential to improve real-time screening for a panel of high-abuse drugs, with the ability to efficiently and quantitatively measure relatively low concentrations of drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and other high-abuse drugs.  We intend to use this technology, sometimes referred to as "Lab on a Disk", to develop devices and tests that could be used at roadside, emergency rooms and in workplace testing to get a rapid and quantitative measure for a panel of such drugs of abuse.  We have detected delta-9-THC (the primary psychoactive component of marijuana) down to concentrations of 5 nanograms per milliliter in our laboratory.  This includes resolving the psychoactive delta-9-THC from its inactive metabolites.  Resolving the psychoactive levels from metabolites is an important step in establishing impairment.  We upgraded our base breathalyzer platform in 2018, and we remain committed to combining it with the SpinDx technology. Our goal is to use this combination to result in a THC breathalyzer.  There is no assurance that our efforts to develop a marijuana breathalyzer will be successful or that significant sales will result from such development if successful.

In March 2017 we acquired all of the assets related to the Real-time Alcohol Detection and Recognition product (“R.A.D.A.R.®”) from Track Group, Inc. (“TRCK”) for $860,000 in cash.  The purchased assets included the R.A.D.A.R.® device with cellular reporting for real-time alcohol monitoring, database infrastructure to tabulate and manage subscriber behavior, and biometric methodology and intellectual property to fully automate identity verification.  The R.A.D.A.R.® device was designed to be part of an offender supervision program as an alternative to incarceration, and it is assigned to offenders as a condition of parole or probation, with random testing throughout the day to demonstrate that they are meeting the conditions of their sentence.  We completed upgrading our base breathalyzer product in Q4 of 2018, and are nearing completion of work in improving the manufacturability of R.A.D.A.R.® devices, which we expect to launch in the first half of 2019.
 
Training
 
Drug and alcohol testing is highly regulated; thus quality training is an important component of our business.  Initially, our network of Master Trainers provided classroom training which generated certification fees.  This was expanded to include instructor materials, online training modules and direct (live) training via webcam.  In 2011, we launched Lifeloc University, a Learning Management System (LMS), defined as “a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses or training programs”, a critical component for online training courses since it provides student accountability.  In 2018 we updated and revised the Lifeloc University LMS utilizing responsive design so it could be viewed on mobile devices.
 
In December 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Superior Training Solutions, Inc. ("STS"), a company that develops and sells online drug and alcohol training and refresher courses. The assets we acquired from STS, which have been augmented and updated to enable mobile device usage, complement our existing drug and alcohol training courses.
 
Real Property
 
On October 31, 2014, we purchased the commercial property we use as our corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.  The building consists of 22,325 square feet, of which 10,670 square feet are currently leased to three tenants under leases that expire at various times in 2020. We intend to continue to lease the space we are not occupying, but in the future may elect to expand our own operations into space currently leased to other tenants.  Our purchase of the property was partially financed through a term loan in an original principal amount of $1,581,106, secured by a first-priority mortgage on the property. The loan matures in October 2024.
Additional Areas of Interest
 
Consistent with our business goal of providing "near and remote sensing" products and solutions, our acquisition strategy involves purchasing companies, development resources and assets that are aligned with our areas of interest and that can further aid in our entering additional markets.  We expect to actively research and engage in the acquisition of resources that can expedite our entrance into new markets or strengthen our position in existing ones.
Competition and Markets
 
We sell our products in a highly competitive market and we compete for business with both foreign and domestic manufacturers.  Most of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do.  In addition, there is an ongoing risk that other domestic or foreign companies who do not currently service or manufacture products for our target markets may seek to produce products or services that compete directly with ours.
 
We believe that considerations regarding competition for sales of alcohol monitoring products and services include regulatory approvals, product performance, product delivery, quality, service, training, price, device reliability, ease of use and speed.  We sell certain of our components to customers for incorporation into their own product lines and for resale under their own name.  We believe that, while our resources are more limited than those of our competitors, we will continue to compete successfully on the basis of product innovation, quality, reputation and continued customer service excellence.
 
One of our leading competitors is Intoximeters, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri, a long-established company with strong name recognition in the field of alcohol testing.  It has well established sales channels, a large customer base, and a broad product line.  CMI, Inc. of Owensboro, Kentucky, another major competitor, also has a well-established name, strong position in stationary units used in police work, and international market coverage.  Drägerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, based in Germany, manufactures safety and gas testing equipment.  Its breath alcohol testers are respected for their quality and performance.

In addition, other technologies for the measurement of breath alcohol exist and are employed in other market and application segments where the technology may be more suitable or developed to specific requirements. These include:
 
 
• | Infrared devices, which use infrared light absorption to detect breath alcohol. These devices generally lack portability, and are usually found in fixed locations, such as police stations, where subjects are brought for testing. This technology has the advantage of being mandated by law in most states for evidential use in breath testing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Semiconductor breath testing technology, which is used primarily in consumer breathalyzers. Its primary advantage is low cost, but the technology is not widely accepted by professional users as being as accurate as fuel cell technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chemical tests, which are based on urine and saliva testing. This approach to alcohol testing is more invasive, less convenient than breath testing, and may require subsequent analysis for results. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Blood alcohol tests, which require blood samples. These tests are widely believed to be the most accurate form of alcohol testing because they measure blood alcohol content directly from a sample of the subject's blood. However, the results are not instantaneous, and the tests are more invasive and expensive than breath alcohol testing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing
 
Marketing activities associated with our business include the communication of our value proposition through direct mail, direct and indirect sales channels, trade shows and an information-rich online presence.  We sell our products to the workplace and international markets primarily through distributors.  We sell our law enforcement, corrections and consumer products directly to the end user and our OEM products directly to manufacturers. Leveraging our installed base is important, as is maintaining a well-trained distributor network.  In 2009, we revised our workplace distributor program to place additional emphasis on volume incentives for growth in the form of a rebate program.  Under the program, distributors receive a progressively greater percentage rebate based on the dollar sales they generate. We believe this program helps incentivize our distributors to achieve a higher level of sales than would otherwise be the case.
Domestic Distribution
 
The majority of our sales into the workplace market are made through distributors.  Sales are made by these distributors pursuant to agreements that renew automatically each year unless terminated by either party with advance notice, and such agreements typically grant protected lead generation areas.
International Distribution
 
Over 90% of our international sales for all product lines are made by local distributors, who are given territories generally pursuant to agreements that renew automatically each year unless terminated by either party with advance notice.  Based on reports from our international distributors, we believe that many countries around the world are instituting tougher alcohol abuse prevention laws, strengthening the enforcement of current laws, or both. These laws set limits on the amount of alcohol an individual may have in the blood at specific times (e.g., while driving or during safety-sensitive work activities), or at any time for certain parolees and probationers.  Lifeloc has sold instruments to customers in over 60 countries on six continents worldwide.
Research and Development
 
Lifeloc defines its business broadly to include "near and remote sensing" applications in markets including those outside of traditional alcohol testing.  We believe that our future success depends to a large degree on our ability to conceive and develop improved alcohol detection and measurement products, as well as to identify attractive opportunities for growth outside of breath alcohol testing.  Accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in research and development.  We spent $1,121,827 and $1,076,763 during 2018 and 2017, respectively, on research and development, and on sustaining engineering.  The amount spent in 2018 was higher than the amount spent in 2017 due primarily to upgrading the R.A.D.A.R.® assets and our base product, as well as the SpinDx™ technology.  We expect to increase our emphasis on new product development efforts for existing and new markets.

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
A basic component of our instrument product line is the fuel cell, which we obtain from only a few suppliers.  We believe that our demand for this component is small relative to the total supply, and that the materials and services required for the production of our products are currently available in sufficient quantities and will be available for the foreseeable future.  However, there are relatively few suppliers of the high-quality fuel cells which our breathalyzers require.  Any sudden disruption to the supply of our fuel cells would pose a significant risk to our business.  New sources of fuel cells are uncertain at this time and changes to our fuel cells require approval by the DOT, which, if not received, could have a material effect on our revenues.  While we have traditionally used only one supplier of fuel cells, we have been developing our own fuel cell assembly capability using purchased sensors, which we finalized in 2018.  The next step will be to submit devices utilizing our assembled fuel cells to the Department of Transportation for approval in our Breath Testers.  Even if our own assembled fuel cells are approved, we will continue to purchase a portion of our total fuel cell requirements from our current supplier as necessary to meet the needs of the Company.
Patents, Intellectual Property and Royalties
 
We rely, in part, upon patents, trade secrets and proprietary knowledge as well as personnel policies and employee confidentiality agreements concerning inventions and other creative efforts (collectively, "Lifeloc IP") to develop and to maintain our competitive position. We do not believe that our business is dependent upon any patent, patent pending or license, although we believe that trade secrets and confidential know-how may be important to our commercial success.  
 
We file for patents, copyrights and trademarks to protect our intellectual property rights to the extent practicable.  We hold the rights to nine United States patents and have five patent applications pending, along with international patent applications on our EASYCAL® calibration station and on certain R.A.D.A.R.® assets.  These patents have expiration dates ranging from October 2020 to August 2033.  In 2017, we acquired seven United States patents and several active international patent applications in connection with our purchase of the R.A.D.A.R.® assets. The R.A.D.A.R.® patents and patent applications provide protection around the biometric identification methods used in the R.A.D.A.R.® devices along with a removable sampling chamber for maximum hygienics.  We act to protect our patents from infringement in each instance where we determine that doing so would be economical in light of the expense involved and the level and availability of our financial resources.  While we believe that each of our pending applications relate to a patentable device or concept, there is no guarantee that the patents will be issued.
 
We also enter into royalty and licensing agreements where we license or otherwise confer our intellectual property rights on a licensor in exchange for specified payment terms. In 2012 we entered into a royalty agreement with an OEM customer which provides for the monthly payment of royalties to us on all products containing certain of our software sold by our customer.  The agreement is of perpetual duration, but is terminable by the OEM customer upon six months' notice. In 2013 we began receiving royalties from another customer as a result of entering into a second royalty agreement, which provides for the monthly payment of royalties to us on all products containing certain of our software sold by our customer. The agreement is of perpetual duration, but is terminable by the customer upon six months' notice or by us upon 12 months notice.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 33 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment.  Lifeloc sells cylinders of ethanol in nitrogen (UN1956, Class 2.2) for use in calibrating breath alcohol testers. The gas mixture is a hazardous material as defined by the DOT (see 49 CFR 172). We believe we are in substantial compliance with the appropriate DOT regulations for the handling and shipment of dry gas containers, as well as all other state or local laws governing the transportation of hazardous materials. The DOT regulations include strict labeling and packaging requirements, as well as requirements pertaining to shipping papers and declaration forms that must be completed by the shipper.  In addition, we provide a Safety Data Sheet ("SDS") with every tank, and all employees involved in shipping hazardous materials are required to have appropriate certification.   Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability, which could have a material impact on our business. The cost of complying with these regulations is considered as an ongoing cost of operations, and is not material.
 Government Regulation of the Business
 All breath testers manufactured in the United States explicitly for personal use are regulated as Class I medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). These regulations apply to the manufacture and sale of our LifeGuard® product, and we are subject to inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with these regulations.  FDA inspections are conducted periodically at the discretion of the FDA.  On June 26, 2017, we were inspected by the FDA and no violations were issued. 
 In connection with its distribution of cylinders of ethanol in nitrogen for use in calibrating breath alcohol testers (described above under "—Environmental Matters"), Lifeloc has trained on and is following the requirements of OSHA's Hazardous Communications Standard of 2012 (referred to as "HazCom 2012"). Compliance with HazCom 2012 requires providing employee information and training, labeling of chemicals used by Lifeloc and updating MSDS to the new harmonized Safety Data Sheets ("SDS") as they become available. It also requires us to prepare and implement a hazard communication program to follow for workers potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals.
 We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and by various state departments of transportation.  The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees in aviation, trucking, railroads, mass transit, pipelines, and other transportation industries. The DOT Office of Drug & Alcohol Policy & Compliance ("ODAPC") publishes, implements, and provides authoritative interpretations of these rules.  These regulations cover all transportation employers, safety-sensitive transportation employees, and service agents.  Manufacturers submit devices to the DOT for testing and approval.  Instruments are tested according to their model specifications and, if passed, included on the Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath Alcohol Measurement Devices (the "CPL") published periodically in the Federal Register.  Law enforcement applications also require that portable breath testing instruments be included on the CPL.  Lifeloc's FC10, FC10Plus, FC20, FC20BT, EV30, and Phoenix® 6.0 are included on the CPL.  We believe that we were in substantial compliance with the regulations described above as of December 31, 2018 for our products sold into these markets and states.
