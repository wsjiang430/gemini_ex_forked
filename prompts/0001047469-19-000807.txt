     Item 1.    Business 
  Overview 
         Software developers are reinventing nearly every aspect of business today. Yet as developers, we repeatedly encountered an area where we could not innovatecommunications. Because communication is a fundamental human activity and vital to building great businesses, we wanted to incorporate communications into our software applications, but the barriers to innovation were too high. Twilio was started to solve this problem. 
         We believe the future of communications will be written in software, by the developers of the worldour customers. By empowering them, our mission is to fuel the future of communications. 
         Cloud platforms are a new category of software that enable developers to build and manage applications without the complexity of creating and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. These platforms have arisen to enable a fast pace of innovation across a range of categories, such as computing and storage. We are the leader in the Cloud Communications Platform category. We enable developers to build, scale and operate real-time communications within software applications. 
         Our platform consists of three layers: our Engagement Cloud, Programmable Communications Cloud and Super Network. Our Engagement Cloud software is designed to address specific use cases like account security and contact centers and is a set of Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs") that handles the higher-level communication logic needed for nearly every type of customer engagement. These APIs are focused on the business challenges that a developer is looking to address, allowing our customers to more quickly and easily build better ways to engage with their customers throughout their journey. Our Programmable Communications Cloud software is a set of APIs that enables developers to embed voice, messaging and video capabilities into their applications. The Programmable Communications Cloud is designed to support almost all the fundamental ways humans communicate, unlocking innovators to address just about any communication market. The Super Network is our software layer that allows our customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally. It interconnects with communications networks around the world and continually analyzes data to optimize the quality and cost of communications that flow through our platform. The Super Network also contains a set of API's giving our customers access to more foundational components of our platform, like phone numbers. 
         In February 2019, we completed our acquisition of SendGrid, the leading email API platform. Email is an important channel for businesses to communicate with their customers, and incorporating SendGrid's products into our platform will allow us to enable businesses to engage with their customers via email effectively and at scale. In addition, adding this important channel to our platform will allow us to more strategically address our customer's engagement strategy across voice, messaging, video, and now e-mail. 
         We had 64,286 Active Customer Accounts as of December 31, 2018, representing organizations big and small, old and young, across nearly every industry, with one thing in common: they are competing by using the power of software to build differentiation through communications. With our platform, our customers are disrupting existing industries and creating new ones. For example, our customers' software applications use our platform to notify a diner when a table is ready, provide enhanced application security through two-factor authentication, connect potential buyers to real estate agents, and power large, omni-channel contact centers. The range of applications that developers build with the Twilio platform has proven to be nearly limitless. 
         Our goal is for Twilio to be in the toolkit of every software developer in the world. Because big ideas often start small, we encourage developers to experiment and iterate on our platform. We love 
 4

   when developers explore what they can do with Twilio, because one day they may have a business problem that they will use our products to solve. 
         As our customers succeed, we share in their success through our usage-based revenue model. Our revenue grows as customers increase their usage of a product, extend their usage of a product to new applications or adopt a new product. We believe the most useful indicator of this increased activity from our existing customer accounts is our Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate, which compares the revenue from a cohort of Active Customer Accounts, other than Variable Customer Accounts, in a quarter to the same quarter in the prior year. Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate was 140% and 128% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Business MetricsDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate." 
   Our Platform Approach 
         Twilio's mission is to fuel the future of communications. We enable developers to build, scale and operate real-time communications within software applications. 
         We believe every application can be enhanced through the power of communication. Over time, we believe that all of our communications that do not occur in person will be integrated into software applications. Our platform approach enables developers to build this future. 
         Using our software, developers are able to incorporate communications into applications that span a range of industries and functionalities. Our technology partner customers, which embed our products in the solutions they sell to other businesses, are also able to leverage our products to deliver their applications. 
 


Common Use Cases 

 Anonymous
Communications.  Enabling users to have a trusted means of communications where they prefer not to share private information like their telephone
number. Examples include conversations between drivers and riders or texting after meeting through a dating website. 
 Alerts and
Notifications.  Alerting a user that an event has occurred, such as when a table is ready, a flight is delayed or a package is shipped. 
 Contact Center.  Improving
customer support of powering customer care teams with voice, messaging and video capabilities that integrate with other systems to add context, such as a caller's support ticket history of present
location. 
 Call Tracking.  Using phone
numbers to provide detailed analytics on phone calls to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns or lead generation activities in a manner similar to how web analytics track and measure online
activity. 
 Mobile Marketing.  Integrating
messaging with marketing automation technology, allowing organizations to deliver targeted and timely contextualized communications to consumers. 
 User Security.  Verifying user
identity through two-factor authentication prior to log-in or validating transactions within an application's workflow. This adds an additional layer of security to any application.

     Our Platform 
   Engagement Cloud 
         Part of our core strategy is to provide a broad set of lower level building blocks (i.e. the products in our Programmable Communications Cloud and Super Network) that can be used to build virtually any use case. By doing this, we allow developers' creativity to flourish across the widest set of use casessome of which haven't even been invented yet. As we observe what use cases are most common, and the work flows our customers find most challenging, we create the products in our Engagement Cloud to bring these learnings to a broader audience. While developers can build a broad range of applications on our platform, certain use cases are more common. Our Engagement Cloud APIs build upon our Programmable Communications Cloud to offer more fully implemented functionality for a specific purpose, such as two-factor authentication or a contact center, thereby saving developers significant time in building their applications. 
         The higher level APIs we have created in this layer of our platform are focused on addressing a massive opportunity to recreate and modernize the field of customer engagement. The means by which most companies engage with their customers is archaic and disjointed, made more glaring by the pace of development in other areas of communication. Our products in the Engagement Cloud combine the flexibility provided by our platform model along with the learnings we've gained over the past ten years focused on driving success at tens of thousands of customers. 
   Programmable Communications Cloud 
         Our Programmable Communications Cloud provides a range of products that enables developers to embed voice, messaging and video capabilities into their applications. Our easy-to-use developer APIs provide a programmatic channel to access our software. Developers can utilize our intuitive programming language, TwiML, to specify application functions such as <Dial>, <Record> and <Play>, leveraging our software to manage the complexity of executing the specified functions. 
         Our Programmable Communications Cloud consists of software products that can be used individually or in combination to build rich contextual communications within applications. We do not aim to provide complete business solutions, rather our Programmable Communications Cloud offers flexible building blocks that enable our customers to build what they need. Our Programmable Communications Cloud includes: 
 

 Programmable Voice.  Our
Programmable Voice software products allow developers to build solutions to make and receive phone calls globally, and to incorporate advanced voice functionality such as text-to-speech, conferencing,
recording and transcription. Programmable Voice, through our advanced call control software, allows developers to build customized applications that address use cases such as contact centers, call
tracking and analytics solutions and anonymized communications. 
 Programmable Messaging.  Our
Programmable Messaging software products allow developers to build solutions to send and receive messages globally, through channels like SMS, MMS, short codes, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and LINE,
and incorporate advanced messaging functionality such as emoji, picture messaging and localized languages. Our customers use Programmable Messaging, through software controls, to power use cases, such
as appointment reminders, delivery notifications, order confirmations and customer care. 
 Programmable Video.  Our
Programmable Video software products enable developers to build next-generation mobile and web applications with embedded video, including for use cases such as customer care, collaboration and
physician consultations.

     Super Network 
         Our Programmable Communications Cloud is built on top of our global software layer, which we call our Super Network. Our Super Network interfaces intelligently with communications networks globally. We use software to construct a high performance network that continuously optimizes quality and deliverability for our customers. Our Super Network breaks down the geopolitical boundaries and scale limitations of physical network infrastructure and provides our customers that use our Programmable Communications Cloud and Engagement Cloud offering access to over 180 countries. The Super Network also contains a set of API's giving our customers access to more foundational components of our platform, such as phone numbers. 
         We have strategically built out our global infrastructure and operate in 27 cloud data centers in nine geographically distinct regions. These data centers serve as interconnection points with network service providers and customers alike, giving us a truly global reach and a redundant means to connect businesses with billions of customers all over the world. Our provider relationships and deployed infrastructure have allowed us to catalogue the many different communications standards that exist today and offer them up to businesses as one consolidated platform with simple, easy-to-use APIs. We are continually adding new network service provider relationships as we scale, and we are not dependent upon any single network service provider to conduct our business. 
         The strength of Twilio's Super Network comes from the software intelligence we've embedded throughout our communications network. By leveraging our software expertise we eliminate the traditional complexities and uncertainties of telecommunications and deliver a consistent and high quality communications platform for our customers. This allows customers to spend less time focusing on mastering the highly specialized and complex telecommunications industry and more time focusing on building best-in-class customer engagement experiences. Our proprietary technology selects which network service providers to use and routes the communications in order to optimize the quality and cost of the communications across our product offerings. 
         Our Super Network analyzes massive volumes of data from our traffic, the applications that power it, and the underlying provider networks in order to optimize our customers' communications for quality and cost. As such, with every new message and call, our Super Network becomes more robust, intelligent and efficient, enabling us to provide better performance and deliverability for our customers. Our Super Network's sophistication becomes increasingly difficult for others to replicate over time as it is continually learning, improving and scaling. 
   Our Business Model for Innovators 
         Our goal is to include Twilio in the toolkit of every developer in the world. Because big ideas often start small, developers need the freedom and tools to experiment and iterate on their ideas. 
         In order to empower developers to experiment, our developer-first business model is low friction, eliminating the upfront costs, time and complexity that typically hinder innovation. We call this approach our Business Model for Innovators, which empowers developers by reducing friction and upfront costs, encouraging experimentation, and enabling developers to grow as customers as their ideas succeed. Developers can begin building with a free trial. They have access to self-service documentation and free customer support to guide them through the process. Once developers determine that our software meets their needs, they can flexibly increase consumption and pay based on usage. In short, we acquire developers like consumers and enable them to spend like enterprises. 
   Our Growth Strategy 
         We are the leader in the Cloud Communications Platform category based on revenue, market share and reputation, and intend to continue to set the pace for innovation. We will continue to invest 
 7

   aggressively in our platform approach, which prioritizes increasing our reach and scale. We intend to pursue the following growth strategies: 
 

 Continue Significant Investment in our Technology
Platform.  We will continue to invest in building new software capabilities and extending our platform to bring the power of contextual
communications to a broader range of applications, geographies and customers. We have a substantial research and development team, comprising approximately 47% of our headcount as of
December 31, 2018. 
 Grow Our Developer Community and Accelerate
Adoption.  We will continue to enhance our relationships with developers globally and seek to increase the number of developers on our platform.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 64,286 Active Customer Accounts and well over two million registered developer accounts registered on our platform. In addition to adding new developers, we
believe there is significant opportunity for revenue growth from developers who have already registered accounts with us but who have not yet built their software applications with us, or whose
applications are in their infancy and will grow with Twilio into an Active Customer Account. 
 Increase Our International
Presence.  Our platform serves over 180 countries today, making it as simple to communicate from São Paulo as it is from San
Francisco. Customers outside the United States are increasingly adopting our platform, and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from international customer accounts
accounted for 25% and 23% of our total revenue, respectively. We are investing to meet the requirements of a broader range of global developers and enterprises. We plan to grow internationally by
continuing to expand our operations outside of the United States and collaborating with international strategic partners. 
 Further Penetrate the
Enterprises.  We plan to drive greater awareness and adoption of Twilio from enterprises across industries. We intend to further increase our
investment in sales and marketing to meet evolving enterprise needs globally, in addition to extending our enterprise-focused use cases and platform capabilities, like our Twilio Enterprise Plan.
Additionally, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing enterprise customers. 
 Expand Our Partner Channel.  Our
Twilio Build partner program is focused on growing our community of technology and consulting partners. Twilio Build's ecosystem of partners offers customers both packaged applications and consulting
expertise that make it possible for any customer to innovate with Twilio regardless of region, industry, business model or development resources. To help our partners grow their businesses and
innovate for their customers, this program provides go-to-market support, certification and training programs, and a partner success team. We have relationships with a number of technology partner
customers that embed our products in the solutions that they sell to other businesses. We intend to expand our relationships with existing technology partner customers and to add new technology
partner customers. We plan to invest in a range of initiatives to encourage increased collaboration with, and generation of revenue from, technology partner customers. We have started developing
relationships with consulting partners who provide consulting and development services for organizations that have limited software development expertise to build our platform into their software
applications. We intend to continue to invest in and develop the ecosystem for our solutions in partnership with consulting partners to accelerate awareness and adoption of our platform. 
 Selectively Pursue Acquisitions and Strategic
Investments.  We may selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies that strengthen our platform. In
February 2015, we acquired Authy, a leading provider of authentication-as-a-service for large-scale applications. With the integration of Authy, we now provide a cloud-based API to 

 8

   

seamlessly
embed two-factor authentication and phone verification into any application. In November 2016, we acquired the proprietary Web Real-Time-Communication ("WebRTC") media processing
technologies built by the team behind the Kurento Open Source Project. The Kurento Media Server capabilities, including large group communications, transcoding, recording and advanced media
processing, has been integrated into Twilio Programmable Video. In February 2017, we acquired Beepsend, AB, a messaging provider based in Sweden specializing in messaging and SMS solutions. In 2018,
we acquired Ytica.com, a contact center analytics tool developer based in Czech Republic; Core Network Dynamics, a software mobile network infrastructure developer based in Germany; and certain assets
of VAI Technologies, a language recognition platform. In February 2019, we acquired SendGrid, Inc., the leading e-mail API platform. 


 The Twilio Magic 
         We believe there's a unique spirit to Twilio, manifested in who we are and how we work together. These are the principles we use to build an impactful, high growth business while staying true to ourselves. Collectively, these principles guide how we act, how we make decisions, and how we win. 



How We Act 

  Be an Owner.    Owners know their business, embracing the good news and the bad. Owners sweat the details and "pick up the trash." Owners think long term, and spend money wisely. 
         Empower Others.    We believe that unleashing human potentialboth inside and outside our companyis the key to our success. Be humble and realize it's not just about us. Invest in each other. 
  No Shenanigans.    Always act in an honest, direct and transparent way. 
 


How We Make Decisions 

         Wear the Customer's Shoes.    Spend the time to deeply understand customers, and solve problems from their perspective. Earn trust through every interaction. 
  Write It Down.    Our business is complex, so take the time to express yourself in prosefor your sake, and for the folks with whom you're collaborating. 
  Ruthlessly Prioritize.    Prioritization helps break down complex problems, and provides clarity in the face of uncertainty. Decisions are progress, so make decisions with available information and keep learning. 
 


How We Win 

  Be Bold.    We're driven by a hunger to build a meaningful and impactful company. Embrace crazy ideas and remember, every big idea starts small. 
         Be Inclusive.    To achieve our goals, we need a diverse set of voices in the room. Build diverse teams, and seek out unique points of view. 
  Draw the Owl.    There's no instruction book, it's ours to write. Figure it out, ship it, and iterate. Invent the future, but don't wing it. 
  Don't Settle.    Expect the best from yourself and others, because there's no feeling greater than being proud of our work. Hire the best people for every role.

Our development teams designed, built and continue to expand our Engagement Cloud, Programmable Communications Cloud and Super Network. 
 12

           As of December 31, 2018, we had 673 employees in our research and development organization. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform and bring the power of contextual communications to a broader range of applications, geographies and customers. 
   Sales and Marketing 
         Our sales and marketing teams work together closely to drive awareness and adoption of our platform, accelerate customer acquisition and generate revenue from customers. 
         Our go-to-market model is primarily focused on reaching and serving the needs of developers. We are a pioneer of developer evangelism and education and have cultivated a large global developer community. We reach developers through community events and conferences, including our SIGNAL developer conference, to demonstrate how every developer can create differentiated applications incorporating communications using our products. 
         Once developers are introduced to our platform, we provide them with a low-friction trial experience. By accessing our easy-to-configure APIs, extensive self-service documentation and customer support team, developers can build our products into their applications and then test such applications during an initial free trial period that we provide. Once they have decided to use our products beyond the initial free trial period, customers provide their credit card information and only pay for the actual usage of our products. Our self-serve pricing matrix is publicly available and it allows for customers to receive automatic tiered discounts as their usage of our products increases. As customers' use of our products grows larger, some enter into negotiated contracts with terms that dictate pricing, and typically include some level of minimum revenue commitments. Historically, we have acquired the substantial majority of our customers through this self-service model. As customers expand their usage of our platform, our relationships with them often evolve to include business leaders within their organizations. Once our customers reach a certain spending level with us, we support them with account managers or customer success advocates to ensure their satisfaction and expand their usage of our products. 
         We also supplement our self-service model with a sales effort aimed at engaging larger potential customers, strategic leads and existing customers through a direct sales approach. To help increase our awareness in the enterprise, we have expanded our marketing efforts through programs like our Twilio Engage roadshow were we seek to bring business leaders and developers together to discuss the future of customer engagement. We have developed products to support this effort as well, like the Twilio Enterprise Plan, which provides capabilities for advanced security, access management and granular administration. Our sales organization targets technical leaders and business leaders who are seeking to leverage software to drive competitive differentiation. As we educate these leaders on the benefits of developing applications incorporating our products to differentiate their business, they often consult with their developers regarding implementation. We believe that developers are often advocates for our products as a result of our developer-focused approach. Our sales organization includes sales development, inside sales, field sales and sales engineering personnel. 
         When potential customers do not have the available developer resources to build their own applications, we refer them to either our technology partners who embed our products in the solutions that they sell to other businesses (such as contact centers and sales force and marketing automation) or our consulting partners who provide consulting and development services for organizations that have limited software development expertise to build our platform into their software applications. 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had 549 employees in our sales and marketing organization.

     Customer Support 
         We have designed our products and platform to be self-service and require minimal customer support. To enable seamless self-service, we provide all of our users with helper libraries, comprehensive documentation, how-to's and tutorials. We supplement and enhance these tools with the participation of our engaged developer community. In addition, we provide support options to address the individualized needs of our customers. All developers get free email-based support with API status notifications. Our developers also engage with the broader Twilio community to resolve certain issues. 
         We also offer three paid tiers of email and phone support with increasing levels of availability and guaranteed response times. Our highest tier personalized plan is intended for our largest customers and includes guaranteed response times that vary based on the priority of the request, a dedicated support engineer, a duty manager and quarterly status review. Our support model is global, with 24x7 coverage and support offices located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Singapore. We currently derive an insignificant amount of revenue from fees charged for customer support. 
   Competition 
         The market for Cloud Communications Platform is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
 

 completeness of offering; 
 credibility with developers; 
 global reach; 
 ease of integration and programmability; 
 product features; 
 platform scalability, reliability, security and performance; 
 brand awareness and reputation; 
 the strength of sales and marketing efforts; 
 customer support; and 
 the cost of deploying and using our products. 

         We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We believe that none of our competitors currently competes directly with us across all of our product offerings. 
         Our competitors fall into four primary categories:
 

 legacy on-premise vendors, such as Avaya and Cisco; 
 regional network service providers that offer limited developer functionality on top of their own physical infrastructure; 
 smaller software companies that compete with portions of our product line; and 
 software-as-a-service "SaaS" companies and cloud platform vendors that offer prepackaged applications and platforms. 

         Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and larger intellectual property portfolios. As a result, certain of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In addition, some competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower 
 14

   prices, with greater depth than our products or geographies where we do not operate. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Moreover, as we expand the scope of our platform, we may face additional competition. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. 
         As of December 31, 2018, in the United States, we had been issued 104 patents, which expire between 2029 and 2037. As of such date, we also had 13 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are related to U.S. patents and patent applications. We have also filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had 15 trademarks registered in the United States and 94 trademarks registered in foreign jurisdictions. 
         We further seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
         Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, companies in the communications and technology industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We currently are subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. 
   Regulatory 
         We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we or our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.

        For example, GDPR, which took full effect on May 25, 2018, enhanced data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to the greater of € 20 million or 4% of global annual revenue. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, meeting the requirements of GDPR has required significant time and resources, including a review of our technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR. We have taken steps to prepare for complying with GDPR, including integrating GDPR-compliant privacy protections into our products and platform, commercial agreements and record-keeping practices to help us and our customers meet the compliance obligations of GDPR. However, additional EU laws and regulations (and member states' implementations thereof) further govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications. If our efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable EU laws and regulations are not successful, we may be subject to penalties and fines that would adversely impact our business and results of operations, and our ability to conduct business in the EU could be significantly impaired. 
         In addition, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 ("TCPA"), restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws, or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of our customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, we could face direct liability.
