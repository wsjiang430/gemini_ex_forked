 ITEM 1.Business
 Explanatory Note
 Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in March 2019 to serve as the subsidiary stock holding company for Pioneer Bank upon the reorganization of Pioneer Bank into the mutual holding company structure. As of June 30, 2019, the reorganization had not been completed. It was completed effective July 17, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no assets or liabilities and had not conducted any business activities other than organizational activities.

 Pioneer Bank
 General
 Founded in 1889, Pioneer Bank is a New York-chartered savings bank that operates 22 retail banking offices in Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady and Warren Counties in New York. We consider these six counties, Schoharie County and the surrounding areas, as our primary market area for our business operations. We attract deposits from the general public and municipalities and use those funds along with advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and funds generated from operations to originate commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial construction loans and home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans. Since January 2016, all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans have been purchases through our relationship with Homestead Funding Corp., an unaffiliated mortgage banking company. We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted primarily of U.S. Government and agency obligations, municipal obligations and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. Municipal deposit banking services are provided through a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary, Pioneer Commercial Bank. Pioneer Bank also sells commercial and consumer insurance products and employee benefit products and services through Anchor Agency, Inc., its insurance agency subsidiary, and provides wealth management services through its subsidiary, Pioneer Financial Services, Inc.
 At June 30, 2019, we had consolidated total assets of $1.5 billion, total deposits of $1.3 billion and net worth of $135.0 million. Pioneer Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the NYSDFS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Our website address is www.pioneerbanking.com.

 Market Area
 Our primary market area encompasses Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie and Warren Counties, which are located in the Capital Region of New York and include the cities of Albany, the capital of New York, Schenectady and Troy. Our offices are located in these counties and surrounding areas, with the exception of Schoharie County. The Capital Region has a diversified economy and representative industries include educational services, technology and health care, along with a strong state government workforce. Large employers in the Capital Region include General Electric, GlobalFoundries, the Golub Corporation, St. Peter’s Health Partners, Albany Medical Center, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State of New York.
 The total population in our primary market area in 2019 is approximately 1.0 million, as estimated by Claritas Pop-Facts Advanced, which provides demographic data based on U.S. Census and other data sources. Of the seven counties in our market area, Saratoga County has the highest level of median household income, estimated at $83,671 in 2019 and projected to grow nearly 9.8% through 2024, and Schoharie County has the lowest median household income, estimated at $54,853 in 2019 and projected to grow 4.1% through 2024, compared to the 2019 estimated median household income of $64,894 and $60,336 for New York and the United States as a whole, respectively.
 We believe that we have developed products and services that will meet the financial needs of our current and future customer base; however, we plan, and believe it is necessary, to expand the range of products and services that we offer to be more competitive in our market area. Our marketing strategies focus on the strength of our knowledge of local consumer and small business markets, as well as expanding relationships with current customers and reaching out to develop new, profitable business relationships.
 Competition
 We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the numerous financial institutions operating in our market area (including other community banks and credit unions), many of which are significantly larger than we are and have greater resources. We also face competition for investors’ funds from other sources such as brokerage firms, money market funds and mutual funds, as well as securities, such as Treasury bills, offered by the Federal Government. Based on FDIC data, at June 30, 2019 (the latest date for which information is available), we had 4.30% of the FDIC insured deposit market share in Albany County among the 20 institutions with offices in the county, 17.83% of the FDIC insured deposit market share in Rensselaer County among the 11 institutions with offices in the county, 3.47% of the FDIC insured deposit market share in Saratoga County among the 16 institutions with offices in the county, 2.28% of the FDIC insured deposit market share in Greene County among the seven institutions with offices in the county, 4.74% of the FDIC insured deposit market share in Schenectady County among the 12 institutions with offices in the county and 0.83% of the FDIC insured deposit market share in Warren County among the 10 institutions with offices in the county. In all six counties, either New York City money center banks (e.g. JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America) or large regional banks (e.g., Key Bank, Citizens Bank, M&T Bank and TD Bank) have a large presence.
 Our competition for loans comes primarily from the competitors referenced above and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies participating in the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, financial technology companies, specialty finance firms and technology companies.
 We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions, including financial technology companies, to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future.

 Lending Activities
 General. Our principal lending activity has been originating commercial real estate loans (including multi-family real estate loans), commercial and industrial loans, commercial construction loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. Beginning in January 2016, we entered into a strategic partnership with Homestead Funding Corp., a mortgage banking company, to outsource our residential mortgage loan originations, underwriting and closing processes. Through this partnership, we refer our customers to the mortgage banking company and then we decide whether we want to purchase the one- to four-family residential real estate loans originated by the mortgage banking company for our portfolio.
 Our commercial lending efforts focus on the small-to-medium sized business market, targeting borrowers with outstanding loan balances that typically range between $2.5 million to $8.0 million. We focus primarily on commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and commercial construction loans in our market area. As part of the commercial lending strategy, we will continue to use our commercial relationships to increase our commercial transactional deposit accounts.

      Commercial Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2019, we had $414.4 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 38.9% of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, industrial facilities, retail facilities, multi-family properties and other commercial properties, substantially all of which are located in our primary market area. At June 30, 2019, multi-family residential real estate loans, which are described below, totaled $72.4 million. Excluding multi-family loans, $102.7 million of our commercial real estate portfolio was owner-occupied real estate and $239.3 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied real estate.
 We generally originate commercial real estate loans with maximum terms of 10 years based on a 20‑year amortization schedule, and loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% (or 75% for non-owner occupied) of the appraised value of the property. Our typical commercial real estate loan has an adjustable rate which generally adjusts every five years that is indexed to the five-year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York amortizing advance indications, plus a margin, subject to an interest rate floor. All of our commercial real estate loans are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines, including requiring borrowers to generally have cash infusions of at least 10% of the loan amount or project cost and that 

 
  6
 
properties with a loan in excess of $500,000 are subject to biennial inspections to verify if appropriate maintenance is being performed. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 120% of the monthly debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property. Our commercial real estate loans are generally appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. Personal guarantees are often obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. The borrower’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates.
 Loans secured by commercial real estate generally are larger than one- to four-family residential loans and involve greater credit risk. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. As a result, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.
 At June 30, 2019, multi-family real estate loans, which we consider a sub-category of commercial real estate loans, totaled $72.4 million, or 17.5% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five to 100 rental units within our market area. We originate a variety of adjustable-rate multi-family residential real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally of up to 25 years (or 30 years if the age of the collateral is less than 10 years old), which may include balloon payments. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust generally every five years and generally are indexed to the comparable Federal Home Loan Bank of New York amortizing advance indications, plus a margin.
 In underwriting multi-family residential real estate loans, we consider several factors, which include a debt service coverage ratio of at least 120%, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential real estate loans have loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loans. The borrower’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates.
 If we foreclose on a multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability.
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. We originate commercial loans and lines of credit to a variety of small and medium sized businesses in our market area. These loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory or other business assets, and we may support this collateral with liens on real property. At June 30, 2019, commercial and industrial loans totaled $183.3 million, or 17.2% of our total loan portfolio. Customers for these loans include professional businesses, family-owned businesses and not for profit businesses. As part of our relationship-driven focus, we generally require our commercial borrowers to maintain a deposit account with us, which improves our interest rate spread, margin and overall profitability.
 Commercial lending products include revolving lines of credit and term loans. Our commercial lines of credit are typically made with adjustable interest rates, indexed to either LIBOR or The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, plus a margin, and we can demand repayment of the borrowed amount due at any time. Term loans are generally made with fixed interest rates, indexed to the comparable Federal Home Loan Bank of New York amortizing advance indications, plus a 

 
  7
 
margin, and are for terms up to 10 years. We focus our efforts on experienced, growing small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with solid operating history and projected cash flow that operate in our market area.
 When making commercial and industrial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial and industrial loans are made in amounts generally of up to 75% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. We generally do not make unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Personal guarantees are often obtained from commercial and industrial borrowers.
 Commercial and industrial loans generally have greater credit risk than residential real estate loans. Unlike residential real estate loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. We try to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards.
 Commercial Construction Loans. We originate loans primarily to established local developers to finance the construction of commercial and multi-family properties or to acquire land for development of commercial and multi-family properties and to fund infrastructure improvements. We also provide construction loans primarily to local developers for the construction of one- to four-family residential developments. We also originate rehabilitation loans, enabling a borrower to partially or totally refurbish an existing structure, which are structured as construction loans and monitored in the same manner. At June 30, 2019, commercial construction loans totaled $85.3 million, or 8.0% of our total loan portfolio. Most of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. We also had undrawn amounts on the commercial construction loans totaling $83.7 million at June 30, 2019.
 Our commercial construction loans are generally interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 24 months. The interest rate is generally a variable rate based on an index rate, typically The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent commercial real estate mortgage loan, but in some cases it may be payable in full. However, our construction loans for the construction of one- to four-family residential developments do not convert to permanent residential real estate loans. Loans can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project.
 Before making a commitment to fund a commercial construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant.
 One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. At June 30, 2019, $281.4 million, or 26.4%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. In January 2016, we entered into a strategic partnership with Homestead Funding Corp., an unaffiliated mortgage banking company, to outsource our residential mortgage loan originations, underwriting and closing processes. As a result, we no longer process this type of loan in-house; and instead residential mortgage loans are processed through Homestead Funding Corp. Pioneer Bank has no ownership interest in this company or any common employees or directors. Homestead Funding Corp.’s staff receives the loan referral from us and then handles the underwriting, processing and closing of the loan. One- to four-family residential real estate loans are funded by Homestead Funding Corp. with an option for Pioneer Bank to purchase the loan upon funding. Through our relationship with Homestead Funding Corp., we can assist applicants in obtaining financing from the mortgage banking company, but we are not required to commit to purchase or portfolio any loan originated by Homestead Funding Corp. The decision whether to acquire each loan is made at the time the borrower’s application is submitted to Homestead Funding Corp. and must generally comply with underwriting guidelines that we have approved.

However Pioneer Bank normally purchases such loans so long as they meet our underwriting standards. We may also purchase one- to four-family residential real estate loans from Homestead Funding Corp. to customers who were not referred to the mortgage banking company by Pioneer Bank.
 For each purchased loan, we generally pay a fixed aggregate fee to Homestead Funding Corp. of 1.75% of the loan balance. This fixed aggregate fee is paid by us regardless of whether the loan was originated by the mortgage banking company directly or was due to our customer referral. We receive no fee for referring a customer to Homestead Funding Corp. For the year ended June 30, 2019, we purchased for our portfolio $57.7 million of loans originated through Homestead Funding Corp. As part of purchasing the loans, we typically acquire the servicing rights to the loans in order to best assist the customer relationship. The purchased loans are acquired from Homestead Funding Corp. without recourse or any right against the mortgage banking company to require the loans to be repurchased from us. The fixed aggregate fee we pay to acquire the loan and servicing rights are deferred as part of the loan balance and amortized over the contractual life of the loan under the interest method.
 We purchase for our portfolio both fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans, as well as adjustable-rate single-family loans, with maturities up to 30 years. At June 30, 2019, our one- to four-family residential real estate loans consisted of $232.0 million of fixed-rate loans and $49.4 million of adjustable-rate loans. Most of these one- to four-family residential properties are located in our primary market area and many are underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines. We refer to loans that conform to the Fannie Mae guidelines as “conforming loans.”  We also purchase for our portfolio loans above the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which at June 30, 2019 was $484,350 for single-family homes in our market area. Loans that exceed that limit are considered “jumbo loans.” At June 30, 2019, we had $50.1 million in jumbo loans.
 Our purchased loans generally adhere to the following guidelines: (1) the loan is an owner-occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loan; (2) the loan does not provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option Arm” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan; (3) the loan is not an “interest only” mortgage loan; (4) the maximum loan term is 30 years; (5) the loan has a loan-to-value ratio up to a maximum of 90%, provided, however, that the loan-to-value ratio may exceed 90% as long as the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance; and (6) the borrower has a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 45%. We may, at our discretion, decide not to purchase a loan based on the income level of the borrower, the appraisal or any other information that is obtained in originating the loan. We do not purchase any “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down-payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).
 Our purchased adjustable-rate residential real estate loans have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period ranging from one to 10 years. After the initial fixed period, the interest rate on adjustable-rate residential real estate loans is generally reset every year based upon a contractual spread or margin above the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities or LIBOR, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year, as published weekly by the Federal Reserve Board, subject to periodic and lifetime limitations on interest rate changes. All of our adjustable-rate residential real estate loans with initial fixed-rate periods of one, five, seven or 10 years have initial and periodic caps of 2% on interest rate changes, with a current cap of 5% over the life of the loan.
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by either first mortgages or second mortgages on owner occupied, one- to four-family residences. At June 30, 2019, outstanding home equity loans and equity lines of credit totaled $80.3 million, or 7.5% of total loans outstanding. At June 30, 2019, the unadvanced portion of home equity lines of credit totaled $40.3 million.
 The underwriting standards used for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a title review, the recordation of a lien, a determination of the applicant’s ability to satisfy existing debt obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and our lines of credit is generally limited to 90% when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and with terms of up to 20 years. Our home equity lines of credit generally have 25‑year 

 
  9
 
terms and adjustable rates of interest, subject to a contractual floor, which are indexed to The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate.
 Home equity loans and lines of credit secured by junior mortgages have greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages. At June 30, 2019, $29.1 million of our home equity loans and lines of credit were in a junior lien position, nearly all of which were second mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure, after repayment of the senior mortgages, if applicable. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers.
 Consumer Loans. We offer a limited range of consumer loans, principally to customers residing in our primary market area with other relationships with us and with acceptable credit ratings. Our consumer loans primarily consist of personal loans to the owners of certain commercial businesses who have commercial loans with us, and to a lesser extent, loans on automobiles and overdraft accounts. At June 30, 2019, consumer loans were $21.5 million, or 2.0% of our total loan portfolio.
 Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential real estate loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
 Originations, Purchases, Participations and Sales of Loans
 Lending activities are conducted by our loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations. We also obtain referrals from existing or past customers and from accountants, real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. All loans that we originate or purchase are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines to the extent applicable for residential loans. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable-rate loans depends upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination and purchase activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment, which typically results in decreased loan demand.
 We generally do not purchase whole loans from third parties other than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans described above. However, we sell participations in loans to other financial institutions in which we generally act as the lead lender. Through our loan participations, we and the other participating lenders generally share ratably in cash flows and any gains or losses that may result from a borrower’s noncompliance with the contractual terms of the loan. We primarily participate in commercial real estate loans (including multi-family real estate loans), commercial and industrial loans and commercial construction loans. From time to time, we may purchase participation interests in loans where we are not the lead lender. We underwrite our participation interest in the loans that we purchase according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At June 30, 2019, the outstanding balances of our loan participations where we are not the lead lender totaled $63.9 million, of which $21.8 million were commercial or multi-family real estate loans, $24.9 million were commercial and industrial loans and $17.2 million were commercial construction loans.
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 Pursuant to New York law, the aggregate amount of loans that Pioneer Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of Pioneer Bank’s capital, surplus fund and undivided profits (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral”). At June 30, 2019, based on the 15% limitation, Pioneer Bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $21.9 million. On the same date, Pioneer 

 
  10
 
Bank had no borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. Following the completion of our mutual holding company reorganization and stock offering on July 18, 2019 and based on the 15% limitation, Pioneer Bank’s loans-to-one borrowing limit increased to approximately $28.9 million as of September, 30 2019. 
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on residential loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns.
 Purchases of residential real estate loans up to $750,000 from Homestead Funding Corp. must be approved by one of the following officers: the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Retail Lending Officer or the Retail Loan Servicing Officer. Purchases of residential real estate loans greater than $750,000 must be approved by our board loan committee, which is comprised of all of the members of the board of directors.
 For commercial loans, loans in excess of the commercial officers’ lending limits require approval from our staff loan committee, which is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Banking Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Commercial Senior Vice Presidents, Commercial Vice Presidents and Commercial Loan Officers. The staff loan committee can approve individual loans of up to prescribed limits, depending on the type of the loan. Loans in excess of the Staff Loan Committee’s loan approval authority require the approval of our board of directors. Specifically, commercial real estate loans in excess of $6.0 million, commercial lines of credit in excess of $2.0 million and commercial loans with a new customer relationship in excess of $1.0 million must be approved by our board of directors. 
 Certain loans that involve policy exceptions must be approved by our board of directors.
 We require title insurance on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan.
 Delinquencies and Asset Quality
 Delinquency Procedures. System-generated late notices are mailed to a borrower after the late payment “grace period,” which is 15 days in the case of all loans secured by residential or commercial real estate and 15 days in the case of commercial and industrial and most consumer loans. A second notice will be mailed to a borrower if the loan remains past due after 30 days, and we attempt to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment. By the 90th day of delinquency, we will issue a pre-foreclosure notice that will require the borrower to bring the loan current within 30 days in order to avoid the beginning of foreclosure proceedings for loans secured by residential real estate. Commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, commercial construction and consumer loans are managed on a loan by loan basis. Decisions to send a demand notice are based on conversations with the borrower to address the delinquency issues. A report of all loans 30 days or more past due is provided to the board of directors monthly.
 Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable that at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method.

 
  11
 

 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair market value, less estimated costs to sell. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan over the fair market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense in the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.
 A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal amount due. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months.

      For the year ended June 30, 2019, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $698,000. Interest income recognized on such loans for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $21,000.
 During the year ended June 30, 2019, non-accrual loans increased primarily with respect to one commercial real estate loan totaling $3.2 million and one commercial construction loan totaling $1.4 million.
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.”  An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.”  Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention.”

 
  13
 

 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 The following table sets forth our amounts of classified loans and loans designated as special mention as of June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The classified loans total at June 30, 2019 includes $12.6 million of non-performing loans.

      Total classified loans increased from June 30, 2018 to June 30, 2019 primarily with respect to an increase in substandard loans consisting of a commercial real estate loan totaling $3.2 million, a loan relationship including three commercial and industrial loans totaling $2.6 million and a loan relationship including one commercial construction loan and one commercial real estate loan totaling $1.6 million.
 Allowance for Loan Losses
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for loans that are individually classified as impaired are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with collateral values, future cash flows on impaired loans, and national and regional economic conditions it is reasonably possible that management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.
 In addition, the NYSDFS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation periodically review our allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, we may have to materially adjust our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.

      Investment Activities
 General. Our board of directors is responsible for approving and overseeing our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Authorized officers, as selected by the board of directors, oversee our investing activities and strategies. The authorized officers include our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President, Controller.
 Our current investment policy authorizes us to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal securities, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, corporate debt securities (limited to no more than 5% of total assets and no more than 15% of our capital in any single issuer), common or preferred stock of a company trading on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index or if the company has $5.0 billion or greater in capitalization (limited to no more than 15% of our capital) and common stock of a company with over $2.0 billion, but less than $5.0 billion, in capitalization (limited to less than 10% of our investment portfolio). We do not engage in any investment hedging activities or trading activities, nor do we purchase any high-risk mortgage derivative products, corporate junk bonds, and certain types of structured notes.
 Debt and equity securities investment accounting guidance requires that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent.

 U.S. Governmental Securities. We maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, at zero risk weighting for capital purposes and as collateral for borrowings. At June 30, 2019, U.S. Government securities consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury securities.
 Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. We invest in fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. A CMO is a type of mortgage-backed security that creates separate pools of pass-through rates for different classes of bondholders with varying maturities, called tranches. The repayments from the pool of pass-through securities are used to retire the bonds in the order specified by the bonds’ prospectus.
 Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration. The timely payment of principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. government with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities.
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. We have not purchased privately-issued mortgage-backed securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.
 Municipal Securities. We invest in fixed-rate investment grade bonds issued primarily by municipalities in the State of New York.
 Equity Securities. Equity securities are comprised of both common and preferred stock of companies in the financial, energy, health care, information technology, consumer cyclicals, industrials, materials and utility sectors.

      Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances, to supplement cash flows, as needed. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan sales, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
 Deposit Accounts. The substantial majority of our deposits are from depositors who reside in our primary market area. We access deposit customers by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments for individuals, businesses and municipalities. We generally request commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us. At June 30, 2019, we had no brokered deposits, but our policy permits us to access such funds if additional liquidity is necessary. We also offer deposit accounts to municipalities. Through our limited purpose subsidiary, Pioneer Commercial Bank, we held $275.7 million in municipal deposits, which represented 20.7% of our deposits at June 30, 2019. We have developed a program for the retention and management of municipal deposits. These deposits are from local government entities such as towns, cities, school districts and other municipalities. We generally solicit their operating and savings accounts and not time-based deposits. Municipal deposit accounts are collateralized by Federal Home Loan Bank of New York letters of credit and by eligible government and government agency securities and municipal obligations. We believe that municipal deposits provide a low cost and stable source of funds and we intend to continue to solicit these types of funds.
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the 

 
  18
 
rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit pricing on a monthly basis and continually review our deposit mix. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates, but generally not the highest rates offered in the market, and to periodically offer special rates to attract deposits of a specific type or with a specific term.
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.
 The following tables set forth the distribution of total deposits by account type at the dates indicated.

The NYSDFS also has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it determines that the savings bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. New York consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Pioneer Bank permit private individual and class action law suits, and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.
 The powers that New York-chartered savings banks can exercise under these laws include the following:
 Lending Activities. A New York-chartered savings bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, participation loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made according to applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security.
 Investment Activities. In general, Pioneer Bank may invest in certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities, and obligations of federal, state, and local governments and agencies thereof), certain types of 

 
  21
 
corporate equity securities, and certain other assets. However, this investment authority is subject to restrictions under federal law. See “—Federal Bank Regulation—Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions.
 Dividends. Under New York Banking Law, Pioneer Bank may declare and pay dividends from its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. Additionally, the approval of the NYSDFS is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to certain adjustments provided for under applicable law.
 Loans to Trustees, Directors and Executive Officers. Under applicable New York Banking Law, Pioneer Bank may not make a loan or other extension of credit directly or indirectly to any of its trustees or executive officers of Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, except that Pioneer Bank may make a loan to an executive officer to become an owner of real property so long as the loan is secured by either (1) a first mortgage or cooperative apartment unit loan, which the property or apartment is to be occupied by the executive officer’s primary residence and is specifically approved in writing by the board of trustees; or (2) a deposit maintained by the executive officer with Pioneer Bank. Following the mutual holding company reorganization, the aforementioned lending restrictions would not apply to executive officers and directors of Pioneer Bank, so long as the Superintendent of the NYSDFS deems the restrictions inapplicable.
 NYSDFS Cybersecurity Rule. Effective March 1, 2017, the NYSDFS requires New York chartered banks and other financial services companies to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of the bank. Specifically, NYSDFS requires regulated financial services company to establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing its new program and policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of information systems and nonpublic information accessible to, or held by, third-parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems.
 Federal Bank Regulation
 Recent Regulatory Reform. On May 24, 2018, The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The Regulatory Relief Act’s provisions include, among other things: (1) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (2) not requiring appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (3) exempting banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from HMDA’s expanded data disclosures; (4) clarifying that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s brokered-deposit regulations; (5) raising eligibility for the 18‑month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; (6) allowing qualifying federal savings banks to elect to operate with the same powers available to a national bank; and (7) simplifying capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the capital ratio for determining well-capitalized status. The federal banking regulators jointly issued a final rule on October 29, 2019 providing that a bank with less than $10 billion in assets may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework whereby it will be considered well-capitalized so long as the community bank’s leverage ratio is greater than 9%.  The new rule takes effect on January 1, 2020. 
 Supervision and Enforcement Authority. Pioneer Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the insurer of its deposits. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
 Pioneer Bank must file reports with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to evaluate Pioneer Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements.

 
  22
 

 The regulatory structure also gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.
 Capital Requirements. Under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, Pioneer Bank is subject to a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that was established in July 2013 (the Basel III capital rules).
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Pioneer Bank exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of AOCI. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in as of January 1, 2016 and was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have issued a rule pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 9% that such institutions may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. If an election to use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework is made, a bank with less than $10 billion in assets with capital exceeding 9% will be considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the requirement to be “well capitalized.” The new rule takes effect on January 1, 2020.

 
  23
 

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. At June 30, 2019, Pioneer Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 Investment Activities. All state-chartered savings banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state-chartered banks may, with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market and to invest in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 capital, as specified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by New York law, whichever is less.
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit state-chartered banks and savings banks to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, banks may establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that interstate branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state.
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action framework under the Basel III capital rules. An institution is considered “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined 

 
  24
 
in the regulations) to total assets equal to or less than 2.0%. At June 30, 2019, Pioneer Bank was classified as a “well capitalized” institution.
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, payment of dividends, and acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and its holding company, if applicable, must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including an order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it is determined to be critically undercapitalized.
 Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, and with all transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes making loans to, purchasing assets from, and issuing guarantees to, an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the bank’s providing services and selling assets to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by a bank to an affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
 Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% stockholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these persons, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Pioneer Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in Pioneer Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of Pioneer Bank’s deposit insurance.
 Privacy Regulations. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations generally require that Pioneer Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to 

 
  25
 
customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Pioneer Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and to not disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes.
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a state non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of each state non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Pioneer Bank’s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating in October 2017 was “Satisfactory”.
 New York has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA, which is applicable to Pioneer Bank. New York Banking law requires the NYSDFS to consider a bank’s record of performance under New York law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Pioneer Bank’s most recent rating under New York law was “Satisfactory”.
 Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Pioneer Bank is subject to a variety of federal and New York statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. Federal laws also prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices against consumers, which can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and state Attorneys General.
 Federal Reserve System
 Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $124.2 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board to between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Pioneer Bank is in compliance with these requirements. Federal Home Loan Bank System
 Pioneer Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Pioneer Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. Pioneer Bank was in compliance with this requirement at June 30, 2019. Holding Company Regulation
 Federal Holding Company Regulation. Pioneer Bancorp, MHC and Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. are bank holding companies registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to regulations, examination, supervision and reporting 

 
  26
 
requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Pioneer Bancorp, MHC and Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and their non-savings bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings bank.
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing discount brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institution subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company.” A “financial holding company” may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. Pioneer Bancorp, MHC and Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. elected to become “financial holding companies.”
 Capital. The Federal Reserve Board must establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets generally are not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board.
 Dividends and Stock Repurchases. A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only from current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policy also requires that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Additionally, under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 Waivers of Dividends by Pioneer Bancorp, MHC. Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay the same dividends per share to Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, unless Pioneer Bancorp, MHC elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Pioneer Bancorp, MHC must receive the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. However, current Federal Reserve Board policy prohibits a mutual holding company that is regulated as a bank holding company, such as Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, from waiving the receipt of dividends paid by its subsidiary holding company. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule applicable to federally-chartered mutual holding companies, stating that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, provided (1) the mutual holding company’s 

 
  27
 
members have approved the dividend waivers by a majority of eligible votes, (2) each officer or trustee of the mutual holding company and mid-tier stock holding company, and any tax-qualified or non-tax qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply waives the right to receive any dividends declared, or the dividend waivers are approved by a majority of the entire board of trustees of the mutual holding company with any officer or trustee of the mutual holding company having any direct or indirect ownership interest in the common stock of the subsidiary mid-tier holding company abstaining from the board vote, and (3) any dividends waived by the mutual holding company are considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form.
 Because of the foregoing Federal Reserve Board restrictions on the ability of a mutual holding company, such as Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, to waive the receipt of dividends declared by its subsidiary mid-tier stock holding company, it is unlikely that Pioneer Bancorp, MHC will be able to waive the receipt of any dividends declared by Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. Therefore, unless Federal Reserve Board regulations or policy change by allowing Pioneer Bancorp, MHC to waive the receipt of dividends declared by Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. without diluting minority stockholders, it is unlikely that Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. will pay any dividends.
 Possible Conversion of Pioneer Bancorp, MHC to Stock Form. In the future, Pioneer Bancorp, MHC may convert from the mutual to capital stock form of ownership, in a transaction commonly referred to as a “second-step conversion.”  In a second-step conversion, depositors of Pioneer Bank would have subscription rights to purchase common stock of the fully-converted Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and the public stockholders of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. would be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for an equal percentage of shares of the fully-converted Pioneer Bancorp, Inc., subject to adjustment if required by the Federal Reserve Board, to reflect any dividends waived by Pioneer Bancorp, MHC or assets owned by Pioneer Bancorp, MHC.
 The board of trustees of Pioneer Bancorp, MHC has no current plans to undertake a second-step conversion transaction. Any second-step conversion transaction would require the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. common stock (excluding shares held by Pioneer Bancorp, MHC) and the approval of depositors of Pioneer Bank. Stockholders will not be able to force a second-step conversion without the consent of Pioneer Bancorp, MHC since a second-step conversion also requires the approval of a majority of all of the outstanding common stock of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc., which can only be achieved if Pioneer Bancorp, MHC votes to approve the second-step conversion.
 Acquisition. Federal laws and regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company, such as Pioneer Bancorp, Inc., without the prior non-objection or approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as is the case with Pioneer Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
 New York Holding Company Regulation. Pioneer Bancorp, MHC and Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. are subject to regulation under New York banking law. Among other requirements, Pioneer Bancorp, MHC and Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. must receive the approval of the NYSDFS before acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of another banking institution, or to otherwise acquire a banking institution by merger or purchase.
 Federal Securities Laws
 Pioneer Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in the offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. 

 
  28
 
may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc., or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks.
 Emerging Growth Company Status. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.”  Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement.

 TAXATION
 Federal Taxation
 General. Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and Pioneer Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and Pioneer Bank.
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Pioneer Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns.
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers.

future year’s taxable income. See Note 10 in the Notes to consolidated financial statements that appear starting on page 59 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.
 Capital Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any loss remaining after the five year carryover period that has not been deducted is no longer deductible. At June 30, 2019, Pioneer Bank had no capital loss carryovers.
 Corporate Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Pioneer Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 Audit of Tax Returns. Pioneer Bank’s federal income tax returns and New York State income tax returns have not been audited in the last three years.
 State Taxation
 In March 2014, tax legislation was enacted that changed the manner in which financial institutions and their affiliates are taxed in New York State. Taxable income is apportioned to New York State based on the location of the taxpayer’s customers, with special rules for income from certain financial transactions. The location of the taxpayer’s offices and branches are not relevant to the determination of income apportioned to New York State. The statutory tax rate is currently 6.5%. An alternative tax on apportioned capital, capped at $5.0 million for a tax year, is imposed to the extent that it exceeds the tax on apportioned income. The New York State alternative tax rate is 0.05% for 2019, 0.025% for 2020 and completely phased out as of January 1, 2021. Qualified community banks and thrift institutions that maintain a qualified loan portfolio are entitled to a specially computed modification that reduces the income taxable to New York State.
