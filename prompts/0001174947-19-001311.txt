General
 
Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our main office in New Brunswick, New Jersey and our branch offices located in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, New Jersey, and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and wholesale funding, in residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, construction loans and investment securities. We also originate consumer loans, which consist primarily of secured demand loans. We originate loans primarily for our loan portfolio. However, from time to time we have sold some of our long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans into the secondary market, while retaining the servicing rights for such loans. In addition we sell the SBA guaranteed portion of SBA loans while retaining the servicing rights for such loans. Our revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and securities, our investment securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Government and government-sponsored enterprise obligations. We also generate revenues from fees and service charges. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings and principal and interest payments on loans and securities. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the NJDBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).

Market Area
 
We are headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and our primary deposit market area is concentrated in the communities surrounding our headquarters branch and our branch offices located in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, New Jersey. Our primary lending market area is broader than our deposit market area and includes all of New Jersey.
 
The economy of our primary market area is largely urban and suburban with a broad economic base that is typical for counties surrounding the New York metropolitan area. The median household income in Middlesex and Somerset county ranks among the highest in the nation.
 
Competition
 
We face intense competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s annual Summary of Deposit report, at June 30, 2019 our market share of deposits was 1.27% and 0.48% in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, respectively. Our market share of deposits was 1.25% and 0.58%, respectively, at June 30, 2018.
 
Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business while maintaining our role as a community bank.
 
Lending Activities
 
We originate residential mortgage loans to purchase or refinance residential real property. Residential mortgage loans represented $190.4 million, or 36.4% of our total loans at September 30, 2019. Historically, we have not originated a significant number of loans for the purpose of reselling them in the secondary market. In the future, however, to help manage interest rate risk and to increase fee income, we may increase our origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. No loans were held for sale at September 30, 2019. We also originate commercial real estate, commercial business and construction loans. At September 30, 2019, these loans totaled $232.5 million, $48.8 million and $28.5 million, respectively. We also offer consumer loans, which consist primarily of home equity lines of credit and stock-secured demand loans. At September 30, 2019, home equity lines of credit and stock-secured demand loans totaled $17.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively.

Residential Mortgage Loans. We originate residential mortgage loans, most of which are secured by properties located in our primary market area and most of which we hold in portfolio. At September 30, 2019, $190.4 million, or 36.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans). Residential mortgage loan originations are generally obtained from our in-house loan representatives, from existing or past customers, through advertising, and through referrals from local builders, real estate brokers and attorneys, and are underwritten pursuant to Magyar Bank’s policies and standards. Generally, residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required on loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%. We generally will not make residential mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 95%, which is the upper limit that has been established by the Board of Directors. Mortgage loans have been primarily originated for terms of up to 30 years. Magyar Bank has not participated in “sub-prime” (mortgages granted to borrowers whose credit history is not sufficient to get a conventional mortgage) or option ARM mortgage lending. At September 30, 2019, non-performing residential mortgage loans totaled $114,000, or 0.06% of the total residential loan portfolio. Interest income of $2,000 would have been recorded on non-performing residential mortgage loans for the year ended September 30, 2019, if they had been current in accordance with their original terms. During the year ended September 30, 2019, there were no charge-offs against the allowance for loan loss for impaired residential real estate loans while $120,000 was recovered from prior year charge offs.
 We also originate home equity loans secured by residences located in our market area. The underwriting standards we use for home equity loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history, an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations, the ongoing payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The maximum combined (first and second mortgage liens) loan-to-value ratio for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit is 80%. Home equity loans are generally offered with fixed rates of interest with the loan amount not to exceed $500,000 and with terms of up to 30 years. At September 30, 2019, there were no non-performing home equity loans nor were there were any charge-offs against the allowance for loan loss.
 Generally, all fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten according to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) guidelines, policies and procedures. Historically, we have not originated a significant number of loans for the purpose of reselling them in the secondary market. In the future we may increase our origination and sale of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to help manage interest rate risk and to increase fee income. There were no fixed-rate mortgage loans sold to Freddie Mac during the year ended September 30, 2019 and there were no loans were held for sale at September 30, 2019.
 We generally do not purchase residential mortgage loans, except for loans to low-income borrowers to enhance our Community Reinvestment Act performance. We did not purchase any participation residential mortgage loans during the year ended September 30, 2019. We underwrite residential mortgage loans participations using the same criteria as if we were originating the loans.
 At September 30, 2019, we had $117.4 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, which represented 61.7% of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio. At September 30, 2019, our largest fixed-rate residential mortgage loan was $1.8 million. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms at September 30, 2019.
  5

We also offer adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with interest rates based on the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasuries or the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) adjusted to a constant maturity of one year, which adjusts either annually from the outset of the loan or which adjusts annually after a one-, three-, five-, seven-, and ten-year initial fixed-rate period. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally provide for maximum rate adjustments of 2% per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment up to 5%, regardless of the initial rate. We also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans with an interest rate based on the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal or the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advance rates.
 Adjustable-rate mortgage loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing. However, these loans have other risks because, as interest rates increase, the underlying payments by the borrower increase, which increases the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. The maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments also may limit the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.
 At September 30, 2019, adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans totaled $73.0 million, or 38.3% of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio. The largest adjustable-rate residential mortgage loan was for $2.6 million. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms at September 30, 2019.
 In an effort to provide financing for low-and moderate-income home buyers, we offer low-to-moderate income residential mortgage loans. These loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and terms of up to 40 years, and are secured by one-to four-family residential properties. All of these loans are originated using underwriting guidelines of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises such as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). These loans are originated with maximum loan-to-value ratios of 95%.
 All residential mortgage loans we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable if the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property securing the mortgage loan. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance, fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. We also originate commercial real estate loans, most of which are secured by properties located in our primary market area. At September 30, 2019, $232.5 million, or 44.5%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of these types of loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally secured by five-or-more-unit apartment buildings, industrial properties and properties used for business purposes such as small office buildings and retail facilities. We generally originate adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans with a maximum term of 25 years with adjustable rate periods every five years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for our commercial real estate loans is 75%, based on the appraised value of the property.
 We consider a number of factors when we originate commercial real estate loans. During the underwriting process we evaluate the business qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability of the property being financed, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the business qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure it is at least 120% of the monthly debt service. We require personal guarantees on all commercial real estate loans made to individuals. Generally, commercial real estate loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees by the principals. All borrowers are required to obtain title, fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance.
 Loans secured by commercial real estate generally are larger than residential mortgage loans and involve greater credit risk. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.
 The maximum amount of a commercial real estate loan is limited by our Board-established loans-to-one-borrower limit, which is currently 15% of Magyar Bank’s capital, or $9.2 million. At September 30, 2019, our largest commercial real estate loan was $5.9 million to finance the purchase of a manufacturing business in New Jersey. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms at September 30, 2019.
  6

At September 30, 2019, four commercial real estate loans totaling $2.7 million were non-performing. During the year ended September 30, 2019, $1,000 was charged-off against the allowance for loan loss and there were no recoveries from prior year charge-offs. Interest income of $111,000 would have been recorded on non-performing commercial real estate loans for the year ended September 30, 2019, if they had been current in accordance with their original terms. All other loans secured by commercial real estate were performing in accordance with their terms.
 Construction Loans. We also originate construction loans for the development of one-to four-family homes, apartment buildings and commercial properties. Construction loans are generally offered to experienced local developers operating in our primary market area and to individuals for the construction of their personal residences. At September 30, 2019, our construction loans totaled $28.5 million, or 5.4% of total loans.
 At September 30, 2019, construction loans for the development of one-to four-family residential properties totaled $13.3 million. These construction loans generally have a maximum term of 24 months. We provide financing for land acquisition, site improvement and construction of individual homes. Land acquisition loans are limited to 50% to 75% of the sale price of the land. Site improvement loans are limited to 100% of the bonded site improvement costs. Construction loans are limited to 75% of the lesser of the contract sale price or appraised value of the property (less funds already advanced for land acquisition and site improvement).
 At September 30, 2019, construction loans for the development of commercial properties totaled $13.3 million. These construction loans have a maximum term of 24 months. The maximum loan-to-value ratio limit applicable to these loans is 75% of the appraised value of the property.
 At September 30, 2019, construction loans for the development of town homes, condominiums and apartment buildings totaled $1.8 million. The maximum loan-to-value ratio limit applicable to these loans is 70% of the appraised value of the property. We may retain up to 10% of each loan advance until the property attains a 90% occupancy level.
 The maximum amount of a construction loan is limited by our loans-to-one-borrower limit, which is currently 15% of Magyar Bank’s capital, or $9.2 million. At September 30, 2019, our largest outstanding construction loan was a $4.9 million loan to finance the construction of a rail-and-truck served transfer station/material recovery facility located in New Jersey. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, there was one non-performing construction loan totaling $2.9 million. Interest income of $368,000 would have been recorded on this non-performing construction loan for the year ended September 30, 2019, if it had been current in accordance with its original term. During the year ended September 30, 2019, there were no construction loan charge-offs against the allowance for loan loss nor were there any recoveries from prior year charge-offs.
 
Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We generally also engage an outside engineering firm to review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of a construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. We require a personal guarantee from each principal of all of our construction loan borrowers.
 Construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Additionally, if our estimate of the value of the completed property is inaccurate, our construction loan may exceed the value of the collateral.
 Commercial Business Loans. At September 30, 2019, our commercial business loans totaled $48.8 million, or 9.3% of total loans. We make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small and mid-sized businesses. Our commercial business loans include term loans and revolving lines of credit. The maximum term of a commercial business loan is 25 years. Such loans are generally used for longer-term working capital purposes such as purchasing equipment or furniture. Commercial business loans are made with either adjustable or fixed rates of interest. The interest rates for adjustable commercial business loans are typically based on the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal.
  7

Included in commercial business loans are SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA provides guarantees of up to 75% of the principal balance (85% for loans under $150,000). These loans are made for the purposes of providing working capital and financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate, and may be made inside or outside the Company’s market place. Generally, an SBA 7(a) loan has a deficiency in its credit profile that would not allow the borrower to qualify for a traditional commercial loan, which is why the government provides the guarantee. The deficiency may be a higher loan to value ratio, lower debt service coverage ratio or weak personal financial guarantees. In addition, many SBA 7(a) loans are for start-up businesses where there is no history of financial information. Finally, many SBA borrowers do not have an ongoing and continuous banking relationship with the Bank, but merely work with the Bank on a single transaction. The guaranteed portions of the Company’s SBA loans are generally sold in the secondary market.
 
When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial strength of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value and type of the collateral. Commercial business loans generally are secured by a variety of collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, savings instruments and readily marketable securities. In addition, we generally require the business principals to execute personal guarantees.
 Commercial business loans generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from his or her employment income, and which are secured by real property with ascertainable value, commercial business loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the borrower’s business. As such the performance of these types of loans may be particularly sensitive to local and/or national economic conditions. Further, any collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. We try to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards.
 The maximum amount of a commercial business loan is limited by our loans-to-one-borrower limit, which is 15% of Magyar Bank’s capital, or $9.2 million. At September 30, 2019, our largest commercial business loan was a $5.6 million loan to a company that provides janitorial services and was secured by the accounts receivable of the company. This loan was performing according to its terms at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, two commercial business loan totaling $1.2 million were non-performing. Interest income of $48,000 would have been recorded on non-performing commercial business loans for the year ended September 30, 2019, if they had been current in accordance with their original terms. During the year ended September 30, 2019, $100,000 was charged-off against the allowance for loan loss for one impaired commercial business loan and there were no recoveries from current or prior year charge-offs.
 Home Equity Lines of Credit and Other Loans. We originate home equity lines of credit secured by residences located in our market area. At September 30, 2019, these loans totaled $17.8 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio. The underwriting standards we use for home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant’s credit history, an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations, the ongoing payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The maximum combined (first and second mortgage liens) loan-to-value ratio for home equity lines of credit is 80%. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest, indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, with terms of up to 25 years.
 The maximum amount of a home equity line of credit loan is limited by our loans-to-one-borrower limit, which is 15% of Magyar Bank’s capital, or $9.2 million currently. At September 30, 2019, our largest home equity line of credit loan was $1.4 million. The loan was performing according to its terms at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, there were no non-performing home equity lines of credit, there were no charge-offs, and there was one recovery totaling $1,000 from a prior year charge-off.
 We also originate loans secured by the common stock of publicly traded companies, provided their shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market, and provided the company is not a banking company. Stock-secured loans are interest-only and are offered for terms up to twelve months and for adjustable rates of interest indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal. The loan amount is not to exceed 70% of the value of the stock securing the loan at any time.
 At September 30, 2019, stock-secured loans totaled $4.7 million, or 0.91% of our total net loan portfolio. Generally, we limit the aggregate amount of loans secured by the common stock of any one corporation to 15% of Magyar Bank’s capital, with the exception of Johnson & Johnson, for which the collateral concentration limit is 150% of Magyar Bank’s capital. At September 30, 2019, loans totaling $4.7 million, or 0.91% of our loan portfolio, were secured by the common stock of Johnson & Johnson a New York Stock Exchange company that operates a number of facilities in our market area and employs a substantial number of residents. Although these loans are underwritten based on the ability of the individual borrower to repay the loan, the concentration of our portfolio secured by this stock subjects us to the risk of a decline in the market price of the stock and, therefore, a reduction in the value of the collateral securing these loans. As of September 30, 2019, the aggregate loan-to-value ratio of the stock-secured portfolio was 30.5%.

Loan Originations, Purchases, Participations and Servicing of Loans. Lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by the current and expected future levels of market interest rates.
 Generally, we retain in our portfolio substantially all loans that we originate. Historically, we have not originated a significant number of loans for the purpose of selling them in the secondary market. In the future, however, to help manage our interest rate risk and to increase fee income, we may increase our origination and sale of fixed-rate residential loans and commercial business loans guaranteed by the SBA. All one-to four-family residential mortgage loans that we sell in the secondary market are sold with servicing rights retained pursuant to master commitments negotiated with Freddie Mac. We sell our loans to Freddie Mac without recourse. No loans were held for sale at September 30, 2019.
 At September 30, 2019, we were servicing SBA guaranteed and commercial participation loans sold in the amount of $24.6 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans.
 From time-to-time, we will also participate in loans, sometimes as the “lead lender.” Whether we are the lead lender or not, we underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At September 30, 2019, we had $20.5 million of loan participation interests in which we were the lead lender, and $17.2 million in loan participations in which we were not the lead lender. There were no commercial real estate loan participations originated during the year ended September 30, 2019 in which we were not the lead lender. We have entered into certain loan participations when the aggregate outstanding balance of a particular customer relationship exceeds our loan-to-one-borrower limit. All loan participations are loans secured by real estate that adhere to our loan policies. At September 30, 2019, all participation loans were performing in accordance with their terms.
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we originated $26.4 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one-to four-family residential mortgage loans and $29.2 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. The fixed-rate loans are primarily loans with terms of 30 years or less. We also originated $7.6 million of construction loans, $8.1 million of commercial business loans, and $3.6 million of home equity lines of credit and other loans.
 We generally do not purchase residential mortgage loans, except for loans to low-income borrowers as part of our Community Reinvestment Act lenders program. At September 30, 2019, we had $9.0 million of one-to four-family residential mortgage loans that were serviced by other lenders.
 Asset Quality
 
We commence collection efforts when a loan becomes 15 days past due with system-generated reminder notices. Subsequent late charge and delinquent notices are issued and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter. Personal, direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection process as a courtesy reminder and later to determine the reason for the delinquency and to safeguard our collateral. When a loan is more than 60 days past due, the credit file is reviewed and, if deemed necessary, information is updated or confirmed and collateral re-evaluated. We make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they are delinquent for more than three months. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received.
 A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is provided to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. If no repayment plan is in process, the file is referred to counsel for the commencement of foreclosure or other collection efforts.

At September 30, 2019, our portfolio of commercial business, commercial real estate and construction loans totaled $309.8 million, or 59.2% of our total loans, compared to $303.1 million, or 59.1% of our total loans, at September 30, 2018. Commercial business, commercial real estate and construction loans generally have more risk than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. As shown in the table above, our troubled debt restructurings and total non-performing assets increased $5.3 million to $14.8 million at September 30, 2019 from $9.5 million at September 30, 2018, and increased $1.2 million from $13.6 million at September 30, 2017.
 
Additional interest income of approximately $530,000 and $40,000 would have been recorded during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, if the non-accrual loans summarized in the above table had performed in accordance with their original terms.
 
The Company accounts for its impaired loans in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require that a creditor measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate except that, as a practical expedient, a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan’s observable market price less estimated costs of disposal, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs of disposal if the loan is collateral dependent. Regardless of the measurement method, a creditor may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable.
 
10

The Company records cash receipts on impaired loans that are non-performing as a reduction to principal before applying amounts to interest or late charges unless specifically directed by the Bankruptcy Court to apply payments otherwise. The Company generally continues to recognize interest income on impaired loans that are performing.
 
Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) occur when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, such as a below market interest rate, extending the maturity of a loan, or a combination of both. There was one new TDR loan totaling $363,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 that was performing in accordance with its restructured terms at September 30, 2019. There were no TDR loans for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
 
Delinquent Loans. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our loan portfolio delinquencies at the dates indicated. Loans delinquent more than three months are generally classified as non-accrual loans.

Real Estate Owned. Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned (“OREO”) until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition.
 
The Company held $7.5 million of OREO properties at September 30, 2019, a decrease of $1.1 million from $8.6 million at September 30, 2018. The Company was able to dispose of four properties with an aggregate carrying value of $1.4 million for a net gain of $57,000 while the Company was also able to secure the title for two other property totaling $503,000 during the year ended September 30, 2019.
 
OREO at September 30, 2019 consisted of three residential properties (two of which were leased) totaling $1.7 million, four real estate lots/land totaling $3.2 million, and four commercial real estate buildings totaling $2.7 million. The Bank is determining the proper course of action for its OREO, which may include holding the properties until the real estate market improves, marketing the properties for individual sale, or selling properties to an investor and/or developer.
 
12

The Company recorded $212,000 in valuation allowances against one property during the year ended September 30, 2019 based on an updated appraisal of the property. Further declines in real estate values may result in a charge to expense in the future. Routine holding costs are charged to expense as incurred and improvements to OREO that enhance the value of the real estate are capitalized.
 
Classified Assets. Federal banking regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” we will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “un-collectible” and of such little value their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management’s close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. On the basis of our review of assets at September 30, 2019, classified loans consisted of $1.4 million of special mention assets and $7.6 million of substandard assets.
 We are required to establish an allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike impairment allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When we classify problem assets, we are required to determine whether or not impairment exists. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Magyar Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When it is determined that impairment exists, a specific allowance for loss is established. For collateral-dependent loans, the loan is reduced by the impairment amount via a reduction to the loan and the allowance for loan loss. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the NJDBI and the FDIC, which can direct us to establish additional loss allowances.
 The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
 

Allowance for Loan Losses
 Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management deems necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses in our loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable, and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2019 was maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable. However, this analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.
 In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the NJDBI and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

Investments
 Our Board of Directors has adopted our Investment Policy. This policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest. The Investment Policy is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors and changes to the policy are subject to approval by our Board of Directors. While general investment strategies are developed by the Asset and Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our President and our Chief Financial Officer. They are responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed. They are authorized to execute transactions that fall within the scope of the established Investment Policy up to $2.5 million per transaction individually or $5.0 million per transaction jointly. Investment transactions in excess of $5.0 million must be approved by the Asset and Liability Committee. Investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the Board of Directors at their regularly scheduled meetings.
 Our investments portfolio may include U.S. Treasury obligations, debt and equity securities issued by various government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, investment-grade corporate debt instruments, and municipal securities. In addition, we may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations and not in excess of Magyar Bank’s Tier 1 capital.
 The Investment Policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner, and purchase and sale decisions be based upon a thorough analysis of each security to determine its quality and inherent risks and fit within our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider the effect of an investment or sale on our risk-based capital and prospects for yield and appreciation.
 At September 30, 2019, our securities portfolio totaled $46.2 million, or 7.3% of our total assets. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased. At September 30, 2019, $29.5 million of our securities were classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost, and $16.7 million were classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. At September 30, 2019, we held no investment securities classified as held-for-trading.
 U.S. Government Agency and Government-Sponsored Enterprise Obligations. At September 30, 2019, our U.S. Government Agency and Government-Sponsored Enterprise Obligations totaled $42.8 million, or 92.7% of our total securities portfolio. Of this amount, $38.9 million were mortgage-backed securities and $4.0 million were debt securities. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other securities in our securities portfolio, we hold these securities, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes and as collateral for certain deposits or borrowings. We invest in these securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by these issuers.
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (“CMO”) securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. To a lesser extent, we also invest in mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by private issuers. At September 30, 2019, our mortgage-backed securities, including CMOs, totaled $39.2 million, or 84.9% of our total securities portfolio. Included in this balance was $363,000 of mortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers. Our policy is to limit purchases of privately issued mortgage-backed securities to non-high risk securities rated “A” or higher by a nationally recognized credit rating agency. High risk securities generally are defined as those exhibiting significantly greater volatility of estimated average life and price due to changes in interest rates than 30-year fixed rate securities.
  16

Mortgage-backed pass through securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed pass through securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages. As loan payments are made by the borrowers, the principal and interest portion of the payment is passed through to the investor as received. CMOs are also backed by mortgages. However they differ from mortgage-backed pass through securities because the principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages are structured so that they are paid to the security holders of pre-determined classes or tranches at a faster or slower pace. The receipt of these principal and interest payments, which depends on the estimated average life for each class, is contingent on a prepayment speed assumption assigned to the underlying mortgages. Variances between the assumed payment speed and actual payments can significantly alter the average lives of such securities. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings and other liabilities.
 Mortgage-backed securities present a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the net yield on the securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if the securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.
 Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.65% at September 30, 2019. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio at September 30, 2019 was $39.4 million, which was $236,000 million less than the amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities in Magyar Bank’s portfolio do not contain sub-prime mortgage loans.
 Corporate and Other Securities. At September 30, 2019, the Bank held one corporate note issued by Wells Fargo Bank at its amortized value totaling $3.0 million. Our Investment Policy allows for the purchase of such instruments and requires that corporate debt obligations be rated in one of the four highest categories by a nationally recognized rating service. We may invest up to 25% of Magyar Bank’s investment portfolio in corporate debt obligations and up to 15% of Magyar Bank’s capital in any one issuer.
 Equity Securities. At September 30, 2019, we held no equity securities other than $2.2 million in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. The investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock is classified as a restricted security, carried at cost and evaluated for impairment. Equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and stock market fluctuations. Such investments other than the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York are carried at their fair value and fluctuations in the fair value of such investments, including temporary declines in value, directly affect our net capital position.
 Securities Portfolios. The following tables set forth the composition of our securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of New York common stock) at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits, including certificates of deposit, demand, savings, NOW and money market accounts, have traditionally been the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities. We obtain certificates of deposit primarily through our branch network and to a lesser extent via the brokered CD market. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank advances, to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds. Additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities, loan and security prepayments and maturities, income on other earning assets and stockholders’ equity. While cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
 Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from customers within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We also accept brokered deposits when attractive rates and terms are available. At September 30, 2019, we had $6.9 million in brokered deposits as compared to $14.8 million at September 30, 2018.
 Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. Personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program are relied upon to attract and retain deposits.
  18

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At September 30, 2019, $116.8 million, or 22.0% of our deposit accounts, were certificates of deposit (including individual retirement accounts).
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

Repurchase agreements are recorded as financing transactions as we maintain effective control over the transferred or pledged securities. The dollar amount of the securities underlying the agreements continues to be carried in our securities portfolio while the obligations to repurchase the securities are reported as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to the party with whom each transaction is executed. Those parties agree to resell to us the identical securities we delivered to them at the maturity or call period of the agreement. The Company did not have any repurchase agreements at or during the year ended September 30, 2019.

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation
 General. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and Magyar Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The most recent audit of Magyar Bank’s federal tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service was for the period ended September 30, 2013. The audit did not result in any material adjustments to the Company’s tax returns or the Company’s financial statements. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Magyar Bancorp, Inc. or Magyar Bank.
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Magyar Bancorp, Inc. reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending September 30th for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
 Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, Magyar Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for computing tax bad debt deductions for tax years after 1995, and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period all applicable excess bad debt reserves accumulated after 1988.
 Currently, Magyar Bank uses the direct charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes.
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 (pre-base year reserves) were subject to recapture into taxable income if Magyar Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests.
 At September 30, 2019, our total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $1.3 million. However, under current law, pre-base year reserves remain subject to recapture if Magyar Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter.
 Alternative Minimum Tax. For tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, the Internal Revenue Code imposed an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (“alternative minimum taxable income” or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Generally, AMT net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of AMT may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and Magyar Bank have been subject to the AMT in prior periods but have subsequently used most of these credits against regular tax liabilities.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 repealed the AMT for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. For the year ended September 30, 2019 the AMT was no longer relevant for Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and Magyar Bank.
 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. At September 30, 2019, a financial institution was able to carry back net operating losses to the preceding five taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any federal or state net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income for tax reporting purposes.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Magyar Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65% when the dividend is received from a corporation having at least 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. A 50% dividends-received deduction is available for dividends received from corporations owned less than 20% by the recipient corporation.
State Taxation
 New Jersey State Taxation. The income of savings institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax. Magyar Bancorp, Inc., Magyar Bank, Magyar Service Corporation, and Magyar Investment Company filed separate New Jersey corporate income tax returns for their fiscal years ended September 30, 2018.
  21

For the tax years ending after July 31, 2019, New Jersey tax law requires members of an affiliated group where there is common ownership to calculate their corporation business tax on a combined or consolidated basis. Magyar Bancorp, Inc., Magyar Bank, Magyar Service Corporation, and Magyar Investment Company will file a New Jersey tax return on a consolidated basis for the year ended September 30, 2019.
 Magyar Bancorp, Inc., Magyar Bank, Magyar Service Corp., and Magyar Investment Company are not currently under audit with respect to their New Jersey income tax returns. Their respective state tax returns have been audited within the past two years.
 Delaware and New Jersey State Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax, but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and a franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
 Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is subject to New Jersey corporate income taxes in the same manner as described above for Magyar Bank.
 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General
 Magyar Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). Magyar Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the “Commissioner”) as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. Magyar Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess Magyar Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
 Magyar Bancorp, Inc., as a bank holding company controlling Magyar Bank, is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the rules and regulations of the FRB under the BHCA and to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the “New Jersey Banking Act”), and to the regulations of the Commissioner under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies. Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp, Inc. are required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB and the Commissioner. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 Any change in such laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and their operations and stockholders.
 Certain of the laws and regulations applicable to Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp, Inc. are summarized below. These summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such laws and regulations.
 
New Jersey Banking Regulation
 
Activity Powers. Magyar Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including Magyar Bank, generally may invest in:

· | real estate mortgages;
--+-----------------------

  22


· | consumer and commercial loans;
--+-------------------------------


· | specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | certain types of corporate equity securities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | certain other assets.
--+----------------------

 A savings bank may also make other investments pursuant to “leeway” authority that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act. “Leeway” investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of “leeway” investments. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Commissioner. New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and regulations. See “Federal Banking Regulation-Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks” below.
 Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank’s capital funds. A savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank’s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. Magyar Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
 Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or alternatively, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Magyar Bank. See “Federal Banking Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action” below.
 Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including Magyar Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on insured state banks. See “Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.”
 Examination and Enforcement. The NJDBI may examine Magyar Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The NJDBI examines Magyar Bank at least every two years. The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. The Commissioner also has authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for a savings bank under certain circumstances such as insolvency or unsafe or unsound condition to transact business.
Federal Banking Regulation
 
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
  23

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year until it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
 At September 30, 2019, Magyar Bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio was 11.96%, total capital to risk-based assets was 12.73%, and Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio was 9.03%.
 
Legislation enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of tangible equity capital to total average consolidated assets of between 8.0% to 10.0% for institutions with less than $10 billion of assets (the “Community Bank Leverage Ratio”). Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative regulatory capital structure will be considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations that has set 9.0% as the minimum capital for the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, effective January 1, 2020. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this capital framework.
 
Prompt Corrective Action. The FDIC Improvement Act established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Effective with the March 31, 2020 Call Report, qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% will be considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.
 Undercapitalized institutions are subject to a variety of mandatory supervisory measures including the requirement to file a capital plan for the FDIC’s approval and dividend restrictions as well as other discretionary actions by the regulator.
 The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is “critically undercapitalized.” For this purpose, “critically undercapitalized” means having a ratio of tangible capital to total assets of less than 2%. The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state bank on the basis of the institution’s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
  24


· | insolvency, or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or the FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the DIF. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a “financial subsidiary” are subject to additional restrictions.
 Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank’s total assets or $50 million. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary’s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary’s assets with the bank’s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State-chartered savings banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that are not authorized under federal law. Although Magyar Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not yet determined to engage in such activities.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Magyar Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of eleven regional federal home loan banks, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Board (“FHFB”). The federal home loan banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member thrift institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. Magyar Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York in specified amounts.
 As of September 30, 2019, Magyar Bank was in compliance with these requirements.
 Enforcement. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including Magyar Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices.
 Deposit Insurance. Magyar Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts at Magyar Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
 
The FDIC assesses insurance premiums based on the category to which an institution is assigned. Under this assessment system, the FDIC evaluates the risk of each financial institution based on its supervisory rating and certain financial ratios for purposes of assigning institutions to a category. Assessments are based on the institution’s category, subject to specified adjustments, with institutions perceived as less risky to the deposit insurance fund paying lower assessments.
 
25

Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC Board changed the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank’s average consolidated total assets minus average Tier 1 capital, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC lowered assessment rates to between 2.5 and 9 basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. The final rule eliminated the adjustment to the rate paid for secured liabilities, including Federal Home Loan Bank advances, since these are now part of the new assessment base.
 
On April 26, 2016, the FDIC Board adopted a rule in accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that requires large institutions (those greater than $10 billion in assets) to bear the burden of raising the Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The rule also amended small institution pricing for deposit insurance which was effective the quarter after the Reserve Ratio reaches 1.15%. The Reserve Ratio is the total of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) divided by the total estimated insured deposits of the industry. The Reserve Ratio reached 1.15% effective as of June 30, 2016, lowering small institution assessment rates to between 1.5 and 16 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category and 3 to 30 basis points for banks in the higher risk categories. The rule required small institutions to receive credits to offset their contribution for raising the Reserve Ratio to 1.35% once the reserve ratio reached 1.38%. During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the reserve ratio reached 1.40% resulting in a $152,000 credit to Magyar Bank, $104,000 of which was used to offset the insurance premium due for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The rule also eliminated the previous risk categories in favor of an assessment schedule based on examination ratings and financial modeling.
 
The deposit insurance assessment rates are in addition to the assessments for payments on the bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO payments continued until the last of the FICO bonds matured in 2019. Our expense for the assessment of deposit insurance and the FICO payments was $326,000 for the year ended September 30, 2019 and $426,000 for the year ended September 30, 2018.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
 
Transactions with Affiliates of Magyar Bank. Magyar Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing Regulation W promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An affiliate is a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and Magyar Bancorp, MHC. In general, loan transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In this regard, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are limited to 10% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates. Collateral of specific types and in specified amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the transaction must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the savings association. In addition, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Magyar Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighbourhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the CRA. Among other things, the current CRA regulations replace the prior process-based assessment factors with a new evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:

· | a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  26


· | an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its service channels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. We received an “outstanding” CRA rating in our most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC in 2016.
 In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 
Loans to a Bank’s Insiders
 
Federal Regulation. A bank’s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider’s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to Magyar Bank’s loans. See “New Jersey Banking Regulation—Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations.” All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) $100,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the Board of Directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either (1) $250,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons.
 
An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
 
In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank’s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavourable features.
 
New Jersey Regulation. Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
Federal Reserve System
 
Federal Reserve Board regulations require all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). At September 30, 2019, Magyar Bank was in compliance with the Federal Reserve Board’s reserve requirements. Savings banks, such as Magyar Bank, are authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank “discount window.” Magyar Bank is deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be generally sound and thus is eligible to obtain secondary credit from its Federal Reserve Bank. Generally, secondary credit is extended on a very short-term basis to meet the liquidity needs of the institution. Loans must be secured by acceptable collateral and carry a rate of interest above the Federal Open Market Committee’s federal funds target rate.
 
27

The USA PATRIOT Act
 
The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) is a law that addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by Section 302(a) of SOX, Magyar Bancorp, Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each are required to certify that its quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal controls; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. has existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and is further enhancing and documenting such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
 
Section 404(b) requires independent auditors to report on management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act provided an exemption on compliance with SOX Section 404(b) for registrants that are neither accelerated nor large accelerated filers as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The inclusion of the exemption in the final reform legislation permanently exempted the auditor attestation requirement and significantly reduced the compliance burdens of smaller reporting companies.  Disclosure of management attestations on internal control over financial reporting continues to be required for smaller reporting companies.
 
Holding Company Regulation
 
Federal Regulation. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is regulated as a bank holding company. Bank holding companies are subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Bank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to amend its consolidated minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies to make them no less stringent than those applicable to insured depository institutions themselves. However, legislation was enacted in December 2014 which required the FRB to amend its “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated holding company capital requirements to generally extend the applicability of the exemption from $500 million to $1 billion in assets. Furthermore, the Economic Growth Act expanded the category of holding companies that may rely on the policy statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. Consequently, bank holding companies of under $3 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise in particular cases.
 
Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and requires the promulgation of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank. See “Federal Banking Regulation—Prompt Corrective Action.” If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
 
As a bank holding company, Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval is required for Magyar Bancorp, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
  28

A bank holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as “well capitalized” under applicable regulations of the FRB, that has received a composite “1” or “2” rating, as well as a “satisfactory” rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company inspection by the FRB, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
 
In addition, a bank holding company that does not elect to be a financial holding company under federal regulation, is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
 

· | making or servicing loans;
--+---------------------------


· | performing certain data processing services;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | providing discount brokerage services, or acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | leasing personal or real property;
--+-----------------------------------


· | making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acquiring a savings and loan association.
--+------------------------------------------

 Bank holding companies that elect to be a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature, including investment banking and insurance underwriting. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. has not elected to be a financial holding company, although it may seek to do so in the future. Bank holding companies may elect to become a financial holding company if:
 
· | each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well capitalized;”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well managed;”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the bank holding company has filed a certification with the FRB stating that it elects to become a financial holding company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would be applicable potentially to Magyar Bancorp, Inc. if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Magyar Bank.
 
It has been the policy of many mutual holding companies to waive the receipt of dividends declared by its subsidiary. In connection with its approval of the reorganization, however, the FRB required Magyar Bancorp, MHC to obtain prior FRB approval before it may waive any dividends. As of the date hereof, FRB policy is to prohibit a mutual bank holding company from waiving the receipt of dividends from its holding company or bank subsidiary, and management is not aware of any instance in which the FRB has given its approval for a mutual bank holding company to waive dividends. It is not currently intended that Magyar Bancorp, MHC will waive dividends declared by Magyar Bancorp, Inc. as long as Magyar Bancorp, MHC is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Conversion of Magyar Bancorp, MHC to Stock Form. Magyar Bancorp, MHC is permitted to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization (a “Conversion Transaction”). There can be no assurance when, if ever, a Conversion Transaction will occur, and the Board of Directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a Conversion Transaction. In a Conversion Transaction a new stock holding company may be formed as the successor to Magyar Bancorp, Inc. (the “New Holding Company”), Magyar Bancorp, MHC’s corporate existence would end, and certain depositors of Magyar Bank would receive the right to subscribe for additional shares of the New Holding Company. In a Conversion Transaction, each share of common stock held by stockholders other than Magyar Bancorp, MHC (“Minority Stockholders”) would be converted into a number of shares of common stock of the New Holding Company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that Minority Stockholders own the same percentage of common stock in the New Holding Company as they owned in Magyar Bancorp, Inc. immediately before the Conversion Transaction, subject to any adjustment required by regulation or regulatory policy. The total number of shares held by Minority Stockholders after a Conversion Transaction also would be increased by any purchases by Minority Stockholders in the stock offering conducted as part of the Conversion Transaction.
 
29

Any Conversion Transaction would require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. common stock held by Minority Stockholders and the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of depositors of Magyar Bank.
 
New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms “company” and “bank holding company” as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey-chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
 Acquisition of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control by the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
 Federal Securities Laws. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
