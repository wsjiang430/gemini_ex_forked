Surge Fintech (ECS Business)
 
We refer to the collective operations of ECS Prepaid, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company, Electronic Check Services, Inc., a Missouri corporation, and Central States Legal Services, Inc., a Missouri corporation, as “Surge Fintech.” This was previously referred to as the “ECS Business.”
 
Surge Fintech has been a financial technology tech and wireless top-up platform for over 15 years. Through a series of transactions between October 2019 and January 2020, we acquired the ECS Business primarily for the favorable ACH banking relationship and a fintech transactions platform processing over 20,000 transactions a day at approximately 8,000 independently owned convenience stores. The platform serves as the proven backbone for wireless top-up transactions and wireless product aggregation for the SurgePays nationwide network.
 
ShockWave CRM™ 
 
SurgePays acquired the Software as a Service (SaaS) Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Billing System software platform “MVNO Cloud Services” on June 7, 2022. SurgePays is rebranding the software as ShockWave CRM. Payment for the software consisted of $300,000 in cash, of which $100,000 was paid in June 2022, and the remaining $200,000 in July 2022. Additionally, the Company issued 85,000 shares of common stock having a fair value of $411,400 ($4.84/share), based upon the quoted closing trading price.
 
ShockWave is an end-to-end cloud-based SaaS offering an Omnichannel CRM, billing system and carrier integrations specific to the telecommunication and broadband industry. Some of these services include sales agent management, device and SIM inventory management, order processing and provisioning, retail Point of Service (POS) activations and payments, customer service management, retention tools, billing, and payments.
 
Surge Blockchain
 
Surge Blockchain Software is a back-office marketplace (accessed through the SurgePays fintech portal for convenience stores) offering wholesale consumable goods direct to convenience stores who are transacting on the SurgePays Fintech platform. The wholesale e-commerce platform is easily accessed through the secure app interface – similar to a website. We believe what makes this sales platform unique is that it also offers the merchant the ability to order wholesale consumable goods at a significant discount from traditional distributors with one touch ease. We are able to sell products at a significant discount by using on demand Direct Store Delivery (DSD). Our platform is connected directly to manufactures, who ship products direct to the store while cutting out the middleman. The goal of the SurgePays Portal is to leverage the competitive advantage and efficiencies of e-commerce to provide as many commonly sold consumable products as possible to convenience stores, corner markets, bodegas, and supermarkets while increasing profit margins for these stores.
 
LogicsIQ, Inc.
 
LogicsIQ, Inc. is a lead generation and case management solutions company primarily serving law firms in the mass tort industry. The company’s CRM “Intake Logics” facilitates the entire life cycle of converting a lead into a signed retainer client integrated into the law firms case management software. Our proven strategy of delivering cost-effective retained cases to our attorney and law firm clients means those clients are better able to manage their media and advertising budgets and reach targeted audiences more quickly and effectively when utilizing our proprietary data driven analytics dashboards. Our ability to deliver transparent results through our integrated Business Intelligence (B.I.) dashboards has bolstered our reputation as an industry leader in the mass tort client acquisition field.
 
Centercom

Competition
 
There are many competitors in the prepaid wireless and mobile broadband industry. We feel what makes SurgePhone different is we are a grassroots company with our products placed in convenience stores where the underbanked shop. We can offer prepaid wireless and financial services, through these stores, at a lower price to customers since we own the transaction software processing the activations and top-ups.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. Most traditional convenience store distributors are companies that have been in business for over 50 years and utilize the historical “manufacturing plant to truck to warehouse to truck to store” logistics model. However, we believe that with our diverse product line, better efficiencies resulting in lower wholesale cost of goods sold, we have the ability to obtain a large market share and continue to generate sales growth and compete in the industry. We believe, in some cases, we will be able to partner with our competition through integration and compensate them for helping us grow due to the uniqueness of the suite of products we offer and the additional revenue stores can unlock. The principal competitive factors in all our product markets are technical features, quality, availability, price, customer support, and distribution coverage. The relative importance of each of these factors varies depending on the region. We believe using our direct store distribution model nationwide will open significant opportunities for growth.
 
The markets in which we operate can be generally categorized as highly competitive. In order to maximize our competitive advantages, we continue to expand our product portfolio to capitalize on market trends, changes in technology and new product releases. Based on available data for our served markets, we estimate that our market share of the convenience store sales business at this time is less than 1%. A substantial acquisition would be necessary to meaningfully and rapidly change our market share percentage.
 
Distributors generally do not have a broad set of product and service offerings or capabilities, and no single distributor currently provides all the top selling consumables while offering products and services to enhance the lifestyle of the underbanked such as prepaid wireless, gift cards, bill payment and reloadable debit cards. We believe this creates a significant opportunity for a dynamic paradigm shift to a nationwide wholesale e-commerce platform.
 
Nationwide Product Deployment 
 
The SurgePays Blockchain platform streamlines the process for bringing products directly to the retail store. Our sales protocols have been tested and proven transferable from one product offering to another while ultimately providing our network of stores with better pricing and a larger product selection.
Competitive Edge
 
Our competitive edge is simple: we have the ability through our software platform, along with our relationships, capacity, efficiency, economies of scale and experience necessary to bring our financial services and prepaid products to the underbanked market in an effective and efficient manner to ensure success. Our sales protocols have been tested and proven transferable from one product offering to another while ultimately improving our target stores with better pricing and more product selection.
 
Our strategy for increasing revenues is based on developing, maintaining, and expanding our nationwide network of retail stores. Our relationship-driven approach to selling along with providing many of the top selling c-store products at a wholesale discount greater than traditional distributors gives management confidence of continued growth into the foreseeable future.
 
We have established relationships with distribution companies delivering significant sales per day for our subsidized mobile broadband product.

Research and Development Activities
 
We conduct research and development on an ongoing basis, including new and existing products to offer and software product development to ensure we are delivering the most efficient, secure, and fast transactions at convenience stores. The SurgePays software platform is housed on the Amazon Web Service Cloud for redundancy, stability, and reliability. Traditionally, convenience stores are high volume and fast paced stores where space at the register is at a premium, thus leaving no room for a computer so wireless top-ups or cell phone activations are done over a Verifone terminal traditionally used for processing credit cards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue the enhancement of our software platform through integrating with POS terminals, or more commonly referred to as “cash registers” while developing new products that meet or anticipate such changes in our served markets. Many of the stores we serve are now connected to the internet. This has allowed us to innovate our software to be more adaptive to equipment that is more compatible with the space constraints of the register area in a store. We’re also closely watching the development of AI tools to see how they could help in support of our merchants and customers.
Seasonality
 
We experience some seasonality whereby the peak tax season months show a higher level of sales and consumption. However, the structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the peak tax season months in the spring have historically been approximately 5% greater than the peak other months, and as our product portfolio continues to expand, the level of seasonal peaks we expect to diminish.
Employees, Affiliates and Exclusive Partners
 
As of March 30, 2023, our human capital resources consist of approximately twenty (20) SurgePays employees, a dedicated team of over forty (40) logistics, activation, and fulfilment personnel, and over two hundred (200) sales, customer service and back-office personnel in our near shore operations center.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel and work strategically utilizing exclusive partners and affiliates to maximize cash flow. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
