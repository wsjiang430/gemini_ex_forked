Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

(a) Business Development
 
Taihe Group, Inc. (OTC “TIHE”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on November 6, 1994 as Choice Book & Video, Inc. On April 9, 1998, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation and changed its name to Littman Resources, Inc. with a mergers and acquisitions business model.
 
In June 1998 the Company merged with NuOncology Labs, Inc. whereby NuOncology Labs, Inc. became the surviving company and on June 26, 1998, filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation and changed its name to NuOnclology Labs, Inc.
 
NuOncology Labs, Inc. operated as commercial laboratory and provided predictive chemosensitivity and immunotherapy predictive tests on biopsy tissues and other oncological laboratory testing services and products. The Company’s business operations included development, identification, testing and licensing of cancer treatment compounds.
 
Business operations for NuOncology Labs, Inc. were abandoned by former management and a custodianship action, as described in the subsequent paragraph, was commenced in 2021.
 
On October 1, 2021, the Circuit Court of the Nineth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida granted the Application for Appointment of Custodian as a result of the absence of a functioning board of directors and the revocation of the Company’s charter. The order appointed Small Cap Compliance, LLC (the “Custodian”) custodian with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock, and authorize new classes of stock. Small Cap Compliance, LLC is controlled by Rhonda Keaveney, its sole member.
 
The court awarded custodianship to the Custodian based on the absence of a functioning board of directors, revocation of the company’s charter, and abandonment of the business. At this time, the Custodian appointed Rhonda Keaveney as sole officer and director.
 
The Custodian attempted to contact the Company’s officers and directors through letters, emails, and phone calls, with no success.
 
Small Cap Compliance, LLC (“SCC”) is a shareholder in the Company and applied to the Court for an Order appointing SCC as the Custodian. This application was for the purpose of reinstating TIHE’s corporate charter to do business and restoring value to the Company for the benefit of the stockholders.
 
The Custodian performed the following actions in its capacity as custodian:
 

· | Funded any expenses of the company including paying off outstanding liabilities 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Brought the Company back into compliance with the Florida Secretary of State, resident agent, transfer agent
· | Appointed officers and directors and held a shareholders meeting

The Custodian paid the following expenses on behalf of the company:
 

· | Florida Secretary of State for reinstatement of the Company, $1,500 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Transfer agent, Issuer Direct, $6,000 
· | Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation for the Company, $175
· | Audit expenses, $17,500 

 
Upon appointment as the Custodian of the Company and under its duties stipulated by the Florida court, the Custodian took initiative to organize the business of the issuer. As Custodian, the duties were to conduct daily business, hold shareholder meetings, appoint officers and directors, reinstate the company with the Florida Secretary of State. The Custodian also had authority to enter into contracts and find a suitable merger candidate. SCC was compensated for its role as custodian in the amount of 17 shares (500,000 pre-reverse split) shares of Restricted Common Stock and 500,000 shares of Convertible Preferred A Series Stock. The Custodian did not receive any additional compensation, in the form of cash or stock, for custodian services. The custodianship was terminated on December 9, 2021.
 
The Company filed a Form D under Rule 504 (b)(1)(iii) in 1998 and filed Form SB12G in 1999 but withdrew the registration on July 9, 1999. The Company has obtained a legal opinion to write off the debt of the abandoned operations.
 
On March 10, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the “Amendment”) with the Florida Secretary of State amending the Company’s Amended Articles of Incorporation to effect:
 

1) | a corporate name changed from Nuoncology Labs, Inc. to Taihe Group, Inc.; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | a one-for-thirty thousand (1:30,000) reverse stock split of the Company’s class of common stock with all other aspects to remain unchanged

 
On January 31, 2023, certain shareholders of Taihe Group, Inc (the “Company”) agreed and transferred 89.9 million shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share; and 10 million shares of its Series A preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Share Transfer”) to Taihe Group Limited (Taihe Samoa), a Company organized under the law of Samoa, of which Mr. Sukardi is the controlling shareholder of Taihe Samoa, for the acquisition of HuaYin International Group Limited (“Hua Yin”), a corporation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Island. Upon completion of the Share Transfer, HuaYin became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Taihe Samoa became the controlling shareholder of the Company.
 
On February 15, 2023, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary HuaYin, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to consummate business acquisitions of (1) PT Bentan Eja Industri, (2) PT Mega Bakau Citrawisata, and (3) PT Mangrove Industry Park Indonesia, entities organized under the laws of Indonesia (the “Target Entities”). Upon closing and completion of the contemplated transaction, each of the Target Entities will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of HuaYin. The closing and completion of the contemplated transaction is subject to various conditions set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
PT Bentan Eja Industri and PT Mega Bakau Citrawisata engage in the development and construction of lands and properties relating to tourism integrating real estates, villas as well as hospitality services located in Bintan Island Indonesia. PT Mangrove Industry Park Indonesia engages in cargo freight logistic services located in Bintan Island Indonesia.

(b) Business of Issuer
 
At this time, the Company has identified or understandings with respect to a potential merger, acquisition, reverse merger or business combination candidate pursuant to which the Company may become an operating company. However, there can be no assurance that this merger will be successfully completed. Until the transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations.
 
The Company is moving in a new direction and has no history of performance. We are in the business of development and construction of lands and properties relating to tourism integrating real estates, villas as well as hospitality services and cargo freight logistic services. The current management have experience in such industries.
 
At present financial revenue has not yet been realized. The Company hopes to raise capital in order to fund the acquisitions and expenses of the business operations.
 
All statements involving our business plan are forward looking statements and have not been implemented as of this filing.
 
The analysis will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position as compared to other businesses of similar size and experience within our contemplated segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
· | Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance and other required items; 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in our contemplated marketplace; and 
· | Other relevant factors 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and implement a business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.

We may incur time and costs required to select and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
As of the time of this filing, the Company has not implemented a business combination. Our business plan is to merge with, or acquire, an operating entity that offers product or service growth potential. We are actively looking for a suitable merger candidate and evaluating potential target companies that align with our business plan. This will require review of financials, products and management of the merger candidate. We anticipate the review process could take up to 30 days after a viable candidate is located.
 
Competition
 
Our company expects to compete with many countries in similar industry. In addition, there are several competitors that are larger and more profitable than the Company. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry changes and grows. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes. We believe that diligently establishing and expanding our funding sources will establish us in an already established industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our offerings and supply chain management are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment.
 
Compliance with development and construction or logistics guidelines will increase development costs and the cost of operating our business. In turn, we may not be able to meet the competitive price point for our end product dictated by the market and our competitors.
 
Again, these are forward looking statements and not an indication of past performance. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and have no merger candidates as of the time of this filing.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Upon effectiveness of our Form 10, we will be subject to the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under the Exchange Act, we will be required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also (1) requires steps be taken to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; (2) establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; (3) creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; (4) prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and (5) establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.
 
We will also be subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A. Preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are provided to our stockholders.

Employees
 
The Company currently has one officer, two directors and no employees. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to execute our business plan. In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to time on an as-needed basis.
