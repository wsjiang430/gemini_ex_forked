Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for people with rare, debilitating, chronic neuromuscular and neurological diseases. We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. 
 Firdapse®
In October 2012, we licensed the North American rights to Firdapse®, a proprietary form of amifampridine phosphate, or chemically known as 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate, from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin). When we acquired the rights to the product, it had already been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), a rare and sometimes fatal autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness. Further, in August 2013, we were granted breakthrough therapy designation by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA), for Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. Further, the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation for Firdapse® for the treatment of patients with Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) and Myasthenia Gravis (MG). 
 On November 28, 2018, we received approval from the FDA for Firdapse® 10 mg tablets for the treatment of adults with LEMS. Prior to that approval, the chemical entity, amifampridine (3,4-diaminopyridine, or 3,4-DAP), had never been approved by the FDA for any indication. Because amifampridine phosphate (Firdapse®) had previously been granted Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of LEMS, we have received seven years of marketing exclusivity for this indication. Further, since we were the first pharmaceutical company to obtain approval for a product containing amifampridine, we have also received five years of marketing exclusivity with respect to the use of this product for all indications, running concurrently with the seven years of orphan marketing exclusivity described above. 
 In January 2019, we launched Firdapse® in the United States, selling through a field force experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare disease products consisting of approximately 20 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers), patient assistance and insurance navigation support (Patient Access Liaisons), and payer reimbursement (National Account Managers) personnel. We also have a field-based force of six medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical communities and patients about LEMS and about our ongoing clinical trial activities evaluating Firdapse® for other ultra-orphan, neuromuscular diseases. Finally, we are working with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including Global Genes, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) to help increase awareness and level of support for patients living with LEMS, CMS and MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis, or MuSK-MG, and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. 
 We are supporting the distribution of Firdapse® through Catalyst Pathways, our personalized treatment support program. Catalyst Pathways is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen to an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most pharmaceutical products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. We believe that by using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In order to help patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies which are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to $10 or less per month is available for all LEMS patients prescribed Firdapse®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to LEMS patients in financial need. Our goal is to ensure that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to Firdapse® for financial reasons. 
 We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of certain types of CMS. This trial, which will include approximately 23 adult and pediatric subjects, is being conducted at trial sites around the United States and Canada. Details of this trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02562066). Based on currently available information, we expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2019. 
 We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of MuSK-MG under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA. The trial is a multi-site, international (United States and Italy), double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial that is targeted to enroll approximately 60 subjects diagnosed with MuSK-MG. The trial will also enroll up to 10 generalized myasthenia gravis patients who will be assessed with the same clinical endpoints but achieving statistical significance in this subgroup of patients is not required and only summary statistics will be provided. We initiated this trial in January 2018 and are currently enrolling subjects. We currently expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2019. Details of this trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03304054).

 Because the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation for Firdapse® for the treatment of patients with CMS and Myasthenia Gravis (MG), if we are the first to receive approvals in the future for Firdapse® for the treatment of CMS or MuSK-MG, we would be eligible to receive seven years of marketing exclusivity for those indications added to our Firdapse® label, of which there can be no assurance. 
 We are conducting a proof-of-concept clinical study evaluating Firdapse® as a symptomatic treatment for patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3, ambulatory. The study is designed as a randomized (1:1), double-blind, 2-period, 2-treatment, crossover, outpatient proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of amifampridine in ambulatory patients diagnosed with SMA Type 3. The study is planned to include approximately 12 patients, and we currently expect to report top-line results from this study in the first half of 2020. Details of this trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03781479). 
 There can be no assurance that our currently ongoing trials evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of CMS, MuSK-MG or SMA Type 3, or any trials we may undertake in the future to evaluate Firdapse® for the treatment of other rare neuromuscular diseases, will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we will ever be granted the right to commercialize Firdapse® for any of these indications. 
 Finally, we intend to take steps to seek approval for Firdapse® in Canada. We also intend as a longer term strategy to seek to develop a sustained release formulation for Firdapse®. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. 
 Recent Developments Regarding Pricing for Firdapse®
The pricing of pharmaceutical products, in general, and of specialty drugs, in particular, has been a topic of concern in the United States Congress, where hearings have been held on the topic, and several bills have been introduced proposing a variety of actions to restrain the prices of drugs. The President of the United States has frequently discussed his intention to reduce drug prices. The Administration has solicited public comment on a variety of regulatory proposals to reduce drug prices, and has also issued several proposed regulations with that objective, such as a proposal to conduct a pilot test that involves tying reimbursement of separately paid drugs under Medicare Part B to an index of average prices of the drug in certain foreign countries, and a proposal to require drug companies to disclose the list price of a drug in direct-to-consumer television advertisements. It is possible that at least some of these legislative proposals will be enacted and some of the proposed regulations will be finalized. We cannot predict how any such laws or regulations, or new laws or regulations that have yet to be proposed, will affect the pricing of our product, of orphan drugs generally, or of pharmaceutical products generally. 
 We have established pricing for Firdapse® at an annual list price of $375,000 for a typical LEMS patient who remains 100% persistent and compliant with therapy for an entire year. We believe that the pricing of our product is in line with the pricing of other products that provide significant clinical benefits in treating an ultra-orphan disease of similar severity and in order to properly compensate companies for the costs associated with developing, manufacturing, and marketing an orphan drug in compliance with regulatory requirements. While there can be no assurance, we believe that our drug will be widely covered and reimbursed by private and public payors for the indicated small population of adult LEMS patients, as part of their mission to assure that rare disease patients receive timely treatment for proven medicines. Furthermore, forecasted rebates, discounts, patient commercial co-pay support, Medicare coverage gap subsidies, statutory Medicaid discounts and other governmental discounts will result in our net sale price being 15-20% lower than our annual list price for the product. 
 In early February 2019, we received a letter from Senator Bernie Sanders asking us to justify our pricing decision for Firdapse®. In the letter, Senator Sanders accuses us of fleecing Americans and immoral exploitation because of our decision regarding the pricing of Firdapse®. We have responded to Senator Sanders, who has issued a public statement in response asking FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to allow pharmacies and manufacturers who were previously making this drug to be permitted to resume providing it. 
 In our response to Senator Sanders, we noted the following: 
 

 | There was a large unmet medical need for an FDA approved therapy to treat LEMS patients. Prior to initiating our development program for amifampridine phosphate, only about 200 LEMS patients were receiving an unapproved, investigational amifampridine product to treat their disease. Since the estimated prevalence of LEMS in the U.S. is about 3,000 patients (of which approximately 1,500 patients have been diagnosed with LEMS in claims data over the last two years), the vast majority of LEMS patients did not have access to an amifampridine-based product. With FDA approval, all adult LEMS patients, now have affordable access to Firdapse®.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | We have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount and, since the approval of Firdapse®, a physician can now simply write a prescription and Firdapse® will be delivered to the patients door within 2-3 days and in most cases the patients monthly out-of-pocket expense will be $10 or less.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | While a few patients may have had access to unapproved, investigational amifampridine, Firdapse® is not an old drug or a repurposed drug. Until Firdapse® was approved, an amifampridine-based product had never been approved in the U.S. for any indication, and thus our product has received a new chemical entity designation from the FDA. We believe that the orphan drug exclusivity that we received because we were the first amifampridine-based product approved in the U.S. is Congress way of incentivizing pharmaceutical companies like ours to take the substantial risks associated with developing and obtaining approval of drugs to treat ultra-rare conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In order to gain FDA approval of our product, we were required to submit the results of more than 70 non-clinical and clinical studies, including two Phase 3 trials evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS, at a cost of millions of dollars. Based on the evidence we presented, in November 2018 the FDA approved Firdapse® (amifampridine phosphate) for use in adults with LEMS. Now, for the first time, LEMS patients have confidence that their therapy is FDA approved and is safe and effective.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We continue to spend millions of dollars per year evaluating Firdapse® in clinical trials as a potential treatment for other rare neuromuscular disorders where there is no current FDA approved drug to treat those disorders. While we are hopeful, we have no guarantees that our investment in the clinical trials for these other indications will be successful.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We respectfully question the notion that the use of an experimental product not approved by the FDA is an acceptable standard of care for LEMS patients  or indeed for any patients. The distribution of products under compassionate use programs is only intended to allow dispensing of unapproved drugs for a limited period of time while companies undertake the necessary steps to obtain FDA review and approval of their product. This means of distribution was never intended to be a final or even a long term mechanism for making drugs available to patients under the law, and such a notion represents a dangerous precedent that runs counter to the entire FDA regulatory structure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There can be no assurance as to how these matters will affect our business or results of operations. 
 We are also aware that the vocal group of neuromuscular physicians and some LEMS patients who have raised these issues in the past are continuing to raise concerns with the pricing of our product and with the appropriateness of the provisions in the Orphan Drug Act under which we were granted exclusivity for Firdapse®. A few of these patients continue to say negative things about us to the media, to the FDA and to politicians. We cannot assess the impact of these activities on our business. 
 Generic Sabril®
In September 2015, we announced the initiation of a project to develop generic versions of Sabril® (vigabatrin). Sabril® is marketed by Lundbeck Inc. in the United States in two dosage forms (powder sachets and tablets) for the treatment of infantile spasms and refractory complex partial seizures. Par Pharmaceutical brought the first generic version of the powder sachet to market, and, to date, several generic versions of the powder sachets have been approved. However, at this time, there is only one approved generic version of the tablets. 
 On December 18, 2018, we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement with Endo International PLCs subsidiary, Endo Ventures Limited (Endo), for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets through Endos United States Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, Par Pharmaceutical. Pursuant to the agreement, we have received an up-front payment, and we will receive milestone payments based on achievement of regulatory approvals, and a sharing of defined net profits upon commercialization and certain expenses for development. 
 There can be no assurance that our collaboration with Endo for the development of generic Sabril® (vigabatrin) tablets will be successful and that if an ANDA is approved for vigabatrin tablets in the future, that it will be profitable to us.

 Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2018, we had cash and investments of approximately $58.5 million. Based on our current financial condition and forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing Firdapse® or become profitable, or as to whether we will require additional funding in the future (and whether any such required funding will be available). See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further information on our liquidity and cash flow. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize novel prescription drugs targeting rare (orphan) neuromuscular and neurological diseases and disorders. We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. Specifically, we intend to: 

 | Commercialize Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS and improve disease awareness. We are currently commercializing Firdapse® in the United States. A cornerstone of our strategy is our development of Catalyst Pathways, our personalized treatment support program, and our development of the patient assistance programs that are required to further our goal that no LEMS patient be denied access to Firdapse® for financial reasons within existing legal restrictions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pursue approval of Firdapse® for CMS, MuSK-MG, SMA Type 3 and other neuromuscular indications. We are currently conducting clinical trials evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of CMS, MuSK-MG and SMA Type 3. If our clinical trials are successful, we hope to add these additional indications to our labeling for Firdapse®. We also intend to seek to evaluate Firdapse® as a treatment for additional neuromuscular indications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Seek to develop a sustained release formulation for Firdapse®. We intend as a longer term strategy to seek to develop a Firdapse® sustained release formulation with meaningful patient benefits for patients with LEMS, CMS and MuSK-MG. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Seek approval for Firdapse® in Canada. We intend to take steps to seek approval for Firdapse® in Canada.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Seek to acquire additional products. While our current focus is in evaluating Firdapse® for other neuromuscular indications, we may in the future seek to acquire additional relatively late stage orphan drug opportunities to add to our product portfolio. However, no agreements have been entered into to date and future product acquisitions would be subject to the availability of funding.

 Firdapse® product overview 
 Firdapse® is Catalysts and BioMarins (depending on market region) registered trade name for amifampridine phosphate tablets. Amifampridine is the WHO (World Health Organization) registered INN (International Nonproprietary Name) and United States Adopted Name (USAN) for the chemical entity, 3,4-diaminopyridine, often abbreviated as 3,4-DAP or DAP. Firdapse® contains the phosphate salt of amifampridine, hence the name amifampridine phosphate. We will refer to our drug by its trade name in the United States (Firdapse®), by the INN/USAN (amifampridine), or by the specific salt in our product (amifampridine phosphate), throughout this Form 10-K.
Amifampridine has been recommended as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now known as the European Academy of Neurology). In December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval from the European Commission (with the trade name Firdapse®) for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS. Safety data from clinical data published over the last 30 years in patients with LEMS or other neurological disorders treated with amifampridine show that amifampridine is well tolerated at doses up to 80 mg per day. Among the 1,279 patients or healthy subjects assessed in the literature, the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were perioral and peripheral paresthesias (unusual sensations like pins and needles), and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and epigastralgia (pain around the upper part of the stomach)). These events were typically mild or moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment. 
 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) 
 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, or LEMS, is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized primarily by muscle weakness of the limbs. The disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction where antibodies are formed against voltage-gated calcium channels on nerve endings, which damages the channels. These calcium channels are responsible for the transport of charged calcium atoms that activate the biochemical machinery responsible for releasing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for causing muscles to contract and the failure to release enough of this neurotransmitter results in muscle weakness in LEMS patients. Additionally, LEMS is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and in some individuals, LEMS is the first symptom of such malignancy. 
 
6 


 LEMS generally affects the extremities, especially the legs. As LEMS most affects the parts of limbs closest to the trunk, difficulties with climbing stairs or rising from a sitting position are commonly reported. Physical exercise and high temperatures tend to worsen the symptoms. Other symptoms often seen include weakness of the muscles of the mouth, throat, and eyes. Individuals affected with LEMS also may have a disruption of the autonomic nervous system, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and/or hypotension. 
 LEMS is managed by treating the symptoms or treating the underlying autoimmune attack on voltage gated calcium channels. Unapproved treatments include steroids, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system; and pyridostigmine and amifampridine, which enhance neuromuscular transmission. Plasma exchange has also been used to attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Firdapse® is a symptomatic treatment and does not alter the underlying autoimmune condition. As a voltage gated potassium blocker, Firdapse® prevents charged potassium atoms from leaving the nerve cells, which prolongs the period of depolarization. This allows more charged calcium atoms to enter the nerves, which enables the nerves to release acetylcholine and causes muscles to contract and to restore lost muscle strength in LEMS patients. 
 Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are approximately 3,000 LEMS patients in the United States, approximately 1,500 of which are presently diagnosed and identified and approximately 1,500 of which we believe are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. However, until awareness of the disease is increased, it is unlikely that the total number of LEMS patients in the United States can be determined with better certainty (as is typical of rare diseases), and the actual number of patients in the United States with LEMS may be higher or lower than our estimate. 
 Some of the factors that affect the size of the population with a rare disease such as LEMS include the number of patients actually diagnosed with the disease, the number of patients who are misdiagnosed with other diseases, and the number of patients who are simply undiagnosed. Additionally, while there is an antibody test that positively identifies patients with LEMS, the test is not particularly well known or utilized at this time by many neurologists. Further, many LEMS patients who have small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are not being treated for LEMS because many oncology medical professionals who treat SCLC patients are generally unfamiliar with how to diagnose and treat LEMS. All of these factors affect the ultimate number of patients who will benefit from treatment with Firdapse®. 
 Firdapse® is the only FDA approved, evidence-based therapy for the treatment of LEMS in adults. 
 Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) 
 Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes, or CMS, are rare neuromuscular disorders comprising a spectrum of genetic defects and are characterized by fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles with onset at or shortly after birth or early childhood; in rare cases symptoms may not manifest themselves until later in childhood. Certain types of CMS are thought to be hereditary (autosomal recessive), while others have no known cause. The severity and course of the genetic disease types are variable, ranging from minor symptoms to progressive disabling weakness; symptoms may be mild, but sudden severe exacerbations of weakness or even sudden episodes of respiratory insufficiency also occur. 
 Patients with CMS may respond to unapproved pharmacologic intervention, including cholinesterase inhibitors, amifampridine (i.e. 3,4-DAP), ephedrine, fluoxetine or quinidine, and albuterol, alone or in combinations. The particular therapy is generally dictated by the diagnosed CMS type, as drugs beneficial in treating one type of CMS can be detrimental in patients with another type of CMS. 
 CMS is rare, and based on currently available information, we estimate that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 CMS patients in the United States. There is currently no drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of CMS. 
 Anti-MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG)
Myasthenia Gravis, or MG, is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by fluctuating weakness of the voluntary muscle groups. The prevalence of MG in the United States is estimated to be about 20/100,000 population (equating to an estimate of approximately 64,000 patients in the United States). However, according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, MG is probably under diagnosed and the prevalence may be higher. For example, patients with MuSK-MG may have focal or regional weakness and muscle atrophy that are more suggestive of motor neuron or muscle membrane (myopathy) disease. MG occurs in all races, both genders, and at any age. MG is not thought to be directly inherited (although it occasionally occurs in more than one member of the same family), nor is it contagious.

 The voluntary muscles of the entire body are controlled by nerve impulses that arise in the brain. These nerve impulses travel down the nerves to the place where the nerves meet the muscle fibers. Nerve fibers do not actually connect with muscle fibers. There is a space between the nerve ending and muscle fiber; this space is called the neuromuscular junction. When the nerve impulse originating in the brain arrives at the nerve ending, it releases a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine travels across the space to the muscle fiber side of the neuromuscular junction where it attaches to many receptor sites. The muscle contracts when enough of the receptor sites have been activated by the acetylcholine. In MG, there can be as much as an 80% reduction in the number of these receptor sites. The reduction in the number of receptor sites is caused by an antibody that destroys or blocks the receptor site. Antibodies are proteins that play an important role in the immune system. They are normally directed at foreign proteins called antigens that attack the body. Such foreign proteins include bacteria and viruses. Antibodies help the body to protect itself from these foreign proteins. For reasons not well understood, the immune system of the person with MG makes antibodies against the receptor sites of the neuromuscular junction. Abnormal antibodies can be measured in the blood of many people with MG. The antibodies destroy the receptor sites more rapidly than the body can replace them. Muscle weakness occurs when acetylcholine cannot activate enough receptor sites at the neuromuscular junction. 
 About 15% of MG patients test negative for the acetylcholine receptor antibody. These patients have seronegative (SN) MG. Approximately 40-50% of these patients with SNMG test positive for antibodies against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), a surface membrane component essential in the development of the neuromuscular junction. These patients are identified as having MuSK-MG. Anti-MuSK antibodies identify a clinically distinguishable, more severe form of MG. The disease is characterized by a prominent weakness of the neck, oro-bulbar and sometimes respiratory musculature. Although many patients with MuSK-MG are presently treated with standard MG treatments such as anticholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants, such patients do not generally respond adequately to these treatments. 
 Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are between 3,000 and 4,800 MuSK-MG patients in the United States. There is currently no drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of MuSK-MG.
Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a spectrum of genetic disorders of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein that affects the function of the neuromuscular junction. The pathogenesis may, in part, progress due to the lack of retrograde signaling from dysfunctional neuromuscular junctions leading to nerve damage and ultimately nerve cell death. As a spectrum of genetic disorders of the SMN protein, the condition varies in severity and the disease has been classified into Types (SMA Types 1 through 4), based primarily on clinical symptoms of the disease. The overall incidence of SMA is believed to be 1 in 6,000 to 10,000 live births, with over half of the cases diagnosed as SMA Type 1. Due to the poor prognosis of SMA Type 1 patients, the actual prevalence is lower, since well over half of the SMA patients are Type 1 and have a very short life span.
 SMA Type 3 (sometimes called Kugelberg-Welander disease) includes clinically heterogeneous patients. They typically reach all major motor milestones in childhood and independent walking by adulthood. However, during infancy they typically have proximal muscular weakness. Some might need wheelchair assistance in childhood, whereas others might continue to walk and live productive adult lives with minor muscular weakness. Patients who lose ambulation often develop scoliosis and other medical problems related to poor mobility and muscle tone, such as obesity and osteoporosis. Two subgroups of severity have been suggested based on the probability of being able to walk by age 10 and on the subsequent probability of losing the ability to walk by age 40. Significant differences in losing the ability to walk have been observed in relation to those with an onset of weakness before (SMA 3a) and after (SMA 3b) age 3. 
 Due to the heterogeneity of the disease and the variations in life expectancy, prevalence is difficult to determine and not well defined for the different types of SMA. Current estimates place the prevalence of SMA Types 2 and 3 at about 1.5 per 100,000 people, with the majority of these being SMA Type 3 due to the longer life span of SMA Type 3 patients. Based on currently available data, we estimate the prevalence of SMA Type 3 in the United States to be between 2,500 and 3,500 patients. 
 There is presently one FDA approved treatment for SMA Type 3 (Nusinersen). We believe that Firdapse® as a treatment for SMA Type 3 has the potential to slow down the progression of this disease and improve patients quality of life, although there can be no assurance that any clinical trial we may conduct will show these effects. We also believe that Firdapse® may be an effective adjunct therapy with other medications to treat this disease.

 Clinical trials supporting our NDA for Firdapse® for LEMS 
 Our first Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS 
 As part of the BioMarin License Agreement, we took over a Phase 3 clinical trial that BioMarin had previously begun in the United States and Europe evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. The trial was designed as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial in approximately 36 LEMS patients. After patients were treated with amifampridine phosphate for at least 91 days, they were randomly assigned to either continue on amifampridine phosphate or be discontinued to placebo over a 2-week period. They were then returned to open label amifampridine phosphate treatment for a two-year follow-up period. 
 On September 29, 2014, we reported top-line results from this trial. The primary endpoint of change in quantitative myasthenia gravis score, or QMG, at day 14 reached statistical significance (p=0.0452), with a worsening of 2.2 points observed in the placebo group and a worsening of 0.4 points observed in the treatment group. Further, the primary endpoint of change in subject global impression, or SGI, at day 14 was highly statistically significant (p=0.0028), with a worsening of 2.6 points observed in the placebo group and a worsening of 0.8 points observed in the treatment group. The results of this trial were published in 2016 in Muscle & Nerve (Muscle Nerve, 2016, 53(5):717-725). 
 First NDA submission and Refuse-to-File Letter 
 On July 22, 2015, we announced that we had initiated a rolling submission of an NDA for Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS and CMS, and on December 17, 2015, we announced the completion of that submission. On February 17, 2016, we announced that we had received a Refuse-to-File (RTF) letter from the FDA regarding our NDA submission. The RTF letter stated that after a preliminary review, the FDA has found that our application was not sufficiently complete and requested additional supporting information, including the requirement that we perform three abuse liability studies for Firdapse®. The letter did not comment on the acceptability of the submitted clinical data, and no judgment was made in the letter on the efficacy or safety of Firdapse®. 
 On April 26, 2016, we announced that we met with the FDA to discuss the RTF letter. During that meeting, the FDA advised us that in addition to the results of our first Phase 3 trial, we would need to submit positive results from a second adequate and well-controlled study in patients with LEMS.

 Our second Phase 3 clinical trial (LMS-003)
Our second Phase 3 trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS (designated as LMS-003) was conducted at sites in Miami, Florida and Los Angeles, California. The double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial had the same co-primary endpoints as our first Phase 3 trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. Further, the FDA allowed us to enroll patients from our Expanded Access Program (EAP) as study subjects in this second trial. This second Phase 3 trial was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA for the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analysis approach to be taken in the trial. Details of the LMS-003 trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02970162). Enrollment in this trial, which included 26 subjects, was completed in October 2017. 
 On November 27, 2017, we reported positive top-line results from this trial. This trial had two prospectively defined co-primary endpoints. The first of these, quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMG), reached statistical significance (p=0.0004), and the second, subject global impression (SGI), reached statistical significance (p=0.0003). More importantly, a clinically significant difference of 6.4 points was observed between the Firdapse® and placebo groups for the QMG endpoint. Firdapse® was well tolerated and showed a similar safety profile to that seen in earlier studies. All p-values reported are based on the entire intent to treat (ITT) population of patients that enrolled in this trial. 
 The prospectively defined secondary endpoint for the physicians clinical global impression of improvement (CGI-I) achieved statistical significance (p=0.0020). Further, the exploratory endpoints of triple timed up and go (3TUG, p=0.0112) and the evaluation of the QMG-Limb domains endpoint (p=0.0010) were also statistically significant. The exploratory endpoint of most bothersome symptom (MBS) (p=0.0572) was not significant, but shows a trend. 
 The results of this trial were published in March 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease (J. Clin Neuromusc Dis 2019; 20:111-119). 
 Approval of Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS in the United States 
 In March 2018, we submitted an NDA seeking approval of Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. Our NDA was accepted for filing in May 2018 and, on November 28, 2018, the FDA granted approval of Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS in adult patients. 
 Post-Approval Required Studies 
 As part of its approval of our NDA for Firdapse® for LEMS, the FDA is requiring us to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of amifampridine after oral administration of Firdapse® relative to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. We expect to submit the final protocol for this trial in the first quarter of 2020 and to complete this trial in 2021. The FDA has also asked us to perform a carcinogenicity study of amifampridine phosphate in a second species of mice and to establish a pregnancy surveillance program to collect and analyze information for a minimum of ten (10) years on pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in women exposed to Firdapse®. 
 Expanded access program 
 We currently operate an expanded access program (EAP) that makes Firdapse® available to qualifying patients diagnosed with LEMS, CMS or Downbeat Nystagmus in the United States who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with Firdapse® being provided to patients at no cost until sometime after FDA approval. We continue to inform neuromuscular physicians on the availability of the Firdapse® EAP and also to work with various rare disease advocacy organizations to inform patients and other physicians about the program. 
 Prior to the approval of our NDA for Firdapse® for LEMS, adult LEMS patients were also eligible to participate in our EAP program, and we are currently in the process of migrating adult LEMS patients who were in our EAP program to our commercial product. We intend to finish the migration of adult LEMS patients from our EAP to Catalyst Pathways by the second quarter of 2019. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Launch of Firdapse® in January 2019 
 In January 2019, we launched Firdapse® in the United States through a field force of approximately 20 personnel who are experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare diseases in sales, patient support and payer reimbursement. The sales representatives (Regional Account Managers) who are part of the field force are targeting the approximately 1,250 physicians who are either neuromuscular specialists or general neurologists with a known adult LEMS patient or specific training in neuromuscular diseases. We also have as part of the field force Patient Access Liaisons who are working with the patients and provider offices to help navigate the insurance landscape, as well as National Account Managers who are working directly with the payors to ensure comprehensive coverage for Firdapse® across the commercial and governmental plans in the United States. We also have a field-based force of six medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical communities and patients about LEMS and about our companys ongoing clinical trial activities. Further, we work closely with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including Global Genes, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) to help increase awareness and the level of support for patients living with LEMS, CMS and MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis, and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat.

 We are supporting the distribution of Firdapse® through Catalyst Pathways, our personalized treatment support program. Catalyst Pathways is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen to an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most pharmaceutical products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. By using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In addition, Catalyst Pathways is the gateway for our free bridge medication for patients during transitioning from investigational product while they are waiting for a coverage determination or, later on, for patients whose access is threatened by the bureaucratic complications arising from a change of insurer. The Catalyst Pathways program is also the access point for our Patient Assistance Program, which provides longer-term free medication for those who are uninsured or functionally uninsured with respect to Firdapse® because they may be unable to obtain coverage from their payer despite having health insurance. 
 The cornerstone of our initial sales efforts is to transition patients who have been in our EAP program and patients who have been taking investigational or compounded 3,4-DAP to our approved product. The level of effort to generate awareness to these patients and their physicians is low, given that they are already aware of 3,4-DAP and Firdapse®. We expect the majority of these patients will quickly transition to Firdapse® by the end of the second quarter of 2019. At the same time, we are beginning efforts on the longer, slower process to identify patients and their physicians who have diagnosed LEMS, but have not had access, awareness or understanding of this treatment for their rare disease. These patients often do not see their physician frequently, have many questions about changing treatment(s), and may not perceive the need to change to a new therapy. Further, we expect during the latter part of 2019 and into future years to focus our commercial efforts to locate misdiagnosed and undiagnosed LEMS patients and provide educational and sales activities to help improve the diagnosis, understanding of the treatment, and information on the prescribing process. We plan to continue to support LEMS and rare disease patient organizational groups efforts to generate awareness and educate patients and physicians on the diagnosis of LEMS, the impact of the disease, and the support services and treatments available. 
 Pricing of and access to Firdapse®
We have established pricing for Firdapse® at an annual list price of $375,000 for a typical LEMS patient who remains 100% persistent and compliant with therapy for an entire year. We believe that the pricing of our product is in line with the pricing of other products that provide significant clinical benefits in treating an ultra-orphan disease of similar severity and in order to properly compensate companies for the costs associated with developing, manufacturing, and marketing an orphan drug in compliance with regulatory requirements. We believe that our drug will be widely covered and reimbursed by private and public payors for the indicated small population of adult LEMS patients, as part of their mission to assure that rare disease patients receive timely treatment for proven medicines. Furthermore, forecasted rebates, discounts, patient commercial co-pay support, Medicare coverage gap subsidies, statutory Medicaid discounts and other governmental discounts will result in our net sale price being 15-20% lower than our annual list price for the product. 
 In order to help patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies who are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to $10 or less per month is available for all LEMS patients prescribed Firdapse®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to LEMS patients in financial need. Our goal is to ensure that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to Firdapse® for financial reasons. 
 Further, we have taken steps to make sure that we have sufficient supply of both finished drug product and amifampridine API to meet all of our patient requirements and the needs for product for our ongoing clinical trials. In that regard, based on available information, we currently estimate that we have sufficient finished drug product and API on hand to supply all current Firdapse® patients (including those we anticipate for the remainder of 2019) for at least 18 months. We have also recently ordered more API to ensure a long-term uninterrupted supply of Firdapse® for all patients, including additional new patients. 
 
11 


 Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for Firdapse® are expected to be made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Particularly given the rarity of LEMS, CMS, and MuSK-MG, we anticipate that securing coverage and appropriate reimbursement from third-party payors will require targeted education and highly skilled insurance navigation experts that have experience with rare disease launches and medical exception processes at insurance companies to provide patient coverage for important rare disease therapies. To that end, we have engaged a dedicated team of field-based market access account managers and reimbursement experts as well as a patient service center staffed with experienced personnel focused on ensuring that clinically-qualified patients have access to our product. 
 There can be no assurance, however, as to whether payors will agree to cover our product and, if so, what level of payment will they make for Firdapse®. In that regard, we have advised payors that we will provide free medication to support titration and confirm patient therapeutic benefit. Further, now that we have launched our product, we are providing patients with access to therapy at no charge while those patients are awaiting coverage decisions. 
 Our efforts to develop Firdapse® as a treatment of additional indications 
 We are currently evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of three additional neuromuscular indications, CMS, MuSK-MG, and SMA Type 3. The current status of our clinical trials evaluating Firdapse® for these additional indications is as follows: 
 Ongoing phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of CMS 
 We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of certain types of CMS. This trial, which will include approximately 23 adult and pediatric subjects, is being conducted at trial sites around the United States and Canada. Details of this trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02562066). Based on currently available information, we expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2019. There can be no assurance that any trial we conduct evaluating Firdapse ® for the treatment of CMS will be successful or whether any NDA or NDA supplement that we may submit for Firdapse ® for the treatment of CMS in the future will be filed by the FDA for review and approved. 
 Previously completed MuSK-MG proof-of-concept study 
 In February 2016, we announced the initiation of an investigator-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of Firdapse® as a symptomatic treatment for patients with MuSK-MG. Seven patients participated in this proof-of-concept trial. We provided study drug, placebo, and financial support for this study. 
 On March 15, 2017, we reported top-line results from this trial. Both of the co-primary efficacy endpoints of change from baseline (CFB) in total Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score (p=0.0003) and CFB in total Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score (p=0.0006) were statistically and clinically significant in this trial. Several secondary efficacy measures also achieved statistical significance. Amifampridine phosphate was well tolerated in this population of patients. 
 The results of this study were recently published in SAGE Open Medicine and can be accessed at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2050312118819013. 
 Ongoing phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of MuSK-MG
We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of MuSK-MG under a SPA with the FDA. The trial is a multi-site, international (United States and Italy), double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial that is targeted to enroll approximately 60 subjects diagnosed with MuSK-MG. The trial will also enroll up to 10 generalized myasthenia gravis patients who will be assessed with the same clinical endpoints but achieving statistical significance in this subgroup of patients is not required and only summary statistics will be provided. The trial will employ a primary endpoint of Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) and a secondary endpoint of Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMG). 
 We initiated this trial in January 2018 and are currently enrolling subjects. We currently expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2019. Details of this trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03304054). 
 
12 


 Proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of SMA Type 3 
 We are currently conducting a proof-of-concept clinical study evaluating Firdapse® as a symptomatic treatment for patients with SMA Type 3. The study is designed as a randomized (1:1), double-blind, 2-period, 2-treatment, crossover, outpatient proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of amifampridine in ambulatory patients diagnosed with SMA Type 3. The study is planned to include approximately 12 patients, and we currently expect to report top-line results from this study in the first half of 2020. Details of this trial are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03781479). 
 Other potential indications 
 We are continuing to identify additional neuromuscular diseases for which Firdapse® may be an effective treatment, and we hope to commence additional clinical studies and trials to evaluate Firdapse® for the treatment of those diseases. There can be no assurance that any of these studies or trials will be successful. 
 Intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protections for Firdapse®
Under the BioMarin License Agreement, we licensed two pending patents and certain trademarks for Firdapse®. One of the licensed patents is a pending composition of matter patent that, if issued, will protect Firdapse® until February 2027, which includes five years of patent term extension that is expected under the Patent Term Restoration Act. This application was initially rejected following an appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The application was refiled with new claims. The new claims were the subject of an office action in which the claims were rejected. A response to the rejection was filed and a final rejection was issued. The application was refiled and we are awaiting an office action. There can be no assurance that this patent will be issued. The second patent claims methods of administering Firdapse®. Substantive examination has begun on this patent application and a final rejection was issued and the application was refiled. We are awaiting the next office action. We may also pursue other patents in order to seek to protect the exclusivity of the drug, dosage forms and methods of administration. 
 Until Firdapse® was approved in November 2018, no drug product containing amifampridine for any indication had been approved by the FDA. Therefore, our version of amifampridine has received five-year new chemical entity exclusivity, which provides a five-year period of marketing exclusivity for all indications. 
 We believe that when Firdapse® was approved for commercialization, Jacobus Pharmaceutical may have had a pending NDA filed with the FDA seeking approval of their version of 3,4-DAP for the treatment of CMS. We do not control the FDAs decision on any NDA previously filed by Jacobus, but if the FDA were to approve it, there can be no assurance as to the impact that any such approval would have on our business and on our commercialization of Firdapse®. 
 We are in the early stages of developing a sustained release formulation of Firdapse®. If we are successful, we will seek to add additional patent protections for that sustained release product, to the extent available. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in those efforts. 
 We have licensed the Firdapse® trademark from BioMarin, and the trademark was registered in the United States in March 2015. 
 Protection of our intellectual property and regulatory exclusivities is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, along with regulatory exclusivity and institutional know-how and continuing technological advancement, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights and regulatory exclusivity in the future development and commercialization of our products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, is crucial to our future success. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
 Generic Sabril®
In September 2015, we announced the launch of a program to develop our version of vigabatrin (CPP-109) as a generic version of Sabril®, which is marketed in the United States by Lundbeck. Lundbecks exclusivity for Sabril® expired on April 26, 2018. 
 On December 18, 2018, we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement with Endo International plcs subsidiary, Endo Ventures Limited, for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets through Endos United States Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, Par Pharmaceutical. Pursuant to the agreement, we have received an up-front payment, and we will receive milestone payments based on achievement of regulatory approvals, and a sharing of defined net profits upon commercialization and certain expenses for development. 
 
13 


 Vigabatrin comes in two dosage forms  a powder sachet and a tablet. Par Pharmaceutical brought the first generic version of the powder sachet to market, and since then several additional generic versions of this product have been approved. However, there is only one approved generic version of the tablets at this time. 
 There can be no assurance that our collaboration with Endo/Par for generic Sabril® will be successful. 
 CPP-115
For the last few years, we had been developing CPP-115, a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor. We licensed this product from Northwestern University (Northwestern) in 2009, under which we acquired worldwide rights to commercialize new GABA aminotransferase inhibitors and derivatives of vigabatrin which had been discovered and patented by Northwestern. Under the terms of the license agreement, Northwestern granted us an exclusive worldwide license to United States composition of matter patents related to the new class of inhibitors and a patent application relating to derivatives of vigabatrin. This included United States patent number 6,794,413 covering the composition of matter for CPP-115.
During 2018, we became aware that certain patents granted to Northwestern in 2018 (which patents have been licensed by Northwestern to an unaffiliated pharmaceutical company for a new GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) were derived from CPP-115. As a result, it is our position that Northwestern has violated the license agreement based on its failure to transfer these new patent rights to us as part of the existing license agreement. It is also our position that Northwesterns publication of information about the new patents in violation of the license agreement has damaged us. On October 26, 2018, we notified Northwestern that we were terminating the license agreement and seeking damages for Northwesterns breach of the license agreement. Further, on the same date, we filed a claim for damages in arbitration against Northwestern for Northwesterns breaches of the license agreement. 
 On November 5, 2018, Northwestern advised us that in its view, Northwestern has a right to terminate the license agreement with us because we allegedly breached the license agreement by failing to pay certain milestones and by allegedly failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize any products. Northwestern has also advised us that, in its view, we have engaged in wrongful conduct and communications with the unrelated pharmaceutical company that licensed the new patents from Northwestern, and that such communications have damaged Northwesterns relationship with that party. We dispute Northwesterns allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against claims that Northwestern has brought against us in the arbitration proceeding. 
 The arbitration is currently pending and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this matter. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We are licensed in Florida as a virtual drug manufacturer, which means that we have no in-house manufacturing capacity and we are obligated to rely on contract manufacturers and packagers. We have no plans to build or acquire the manufacturing capability needed to manufacture any of our research materials or commercial products, and we expect that our drug products and drug substances will be prepared by contractors with suitable capabilities for these tasks and that we will enter into appropriate supply agreements with these contractors at appropriate times in the development and commercialization of our products. Because we will use contractors to manufacture and supply our products, we will be reliant on such contractors. Further, the contractors selected would have to be inspected by the FDA and found to be in substantial compliance with federal regulations in order for a drug application for one of our drug candidates to be approved, and there can be no assurance that the contractors we select would pass such an inspection. 
 We have entered into agreements with a supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) contained in Firdapse® for future requirements and we have contracted with third-party contract manufacturers who are manufacturing Firdapse® tablets for us. 
 Any significant change that we make for Firdapse® must be approved by the FDA in a supplemental NDA (sNDA). If the manufacturing plan and data are insufficient, any sNDA we submit will not be approved. Before an sNDA can be approved, our manufacturers must also demonstrate compliance with FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations and policies. Further, even if we receive approval of any sNDAs for Firdapse®, if our manufacturers do not follow cGMPs in the manufacture of our products, it may delay product launches or shipments and adversely affect our business. 
 
14 


 Since we contract with third parties to manufacture our products, our contract manufacturers are required to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect the manufacturing process. As a result, we do not believe that we will have any significant direct exposure to environmental issues. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed or licensed by us would likely compete with currently marketed and potentially new drugs and therapies even though they are not indicated for these conditions. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of orphan diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources than we have. 
 LEMS is currently treated with unapproved drugs and therapies including steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system, and pyridostigmine. Plasma exchange has also been used in an attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Further, one other product, guanidine HCl tablets, was approved many years ago (during a period when drugs were not required to be reviewed by the FDA for both safety and effectiveness) for use in the treatment of LEMS. However, this drug has significant side effects and is not currently viewed as an effective treatment for LEMS. Notwithstanding, drugs may be prescribed by physicians for the treatment of LEMS whether or not they are considered effective. 
 Further, we are aware that Jacobus Pharmaceutical has been making its 3,4-DAP product available to LEMS patients under compassionate use Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) for a number of years and, based on current information, we believe that approximately 200 adult LEMS patients in the United States were receiving the drug under their program at the time our NDA for Firdapse® was approved. Even though we were the first to obtain an FDA approval for this product and its associated exclusivity protections, we may not be able to stop Jacobus Pharmaceutical from continuing to supply its existing patients under compassionate use INDs. 
 Finally, we are aware that amifampridine has been available from compounding pharmacies for many years and may remain available, even though we have obtained FDA approval of Firdapse®. Compounded amifampridine is likely to be substantially less expensive than Firdapse®. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 included a new section, which clarified the status of pharmacy compounding under Federal law. Under Section 503A, drug products that are compounded by a pharmacist or physician for an individual patient may be entitled to exemptions from three key provisions of the act: (1) the adulteration provision of section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning FDAs cGMP regulations); (2) the misbranding provision of section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and (3) the new drug provision of section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug or abbreviated new drug applications). 
 To qualify for these statutory exemptions, a compounded drug product must satisfy several legal requirements. One of these requirements restricted the universe of bulk drug substances that a compounder may use; i.e., that every bulk drug substance used in compounding: (1) must comply with an applicable and current USP or NF drug monograph, if one exists, as well as the current USP chapters on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, the bulk drug substance must be a component of an FDA-approved drug; or (3) if a monograph does not exist and the bulk drug substance is not a component of an FDA-approved drug, it must appear on a list of bulk drug substances that may be used in compounding (i.e., the bulk substances list). While the advertising provisions in Section 503A were ruled unconstitutional in part in the United States by the Supreme Court in 2002, the FDA has in the last five years aggressively regulated and exercised oversight over the practice of pharmacy compounding since a compounding incident at the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts sickened hundreds and killed over 60 individuals. 
 In 2013, Congress removed the unconstitutional advertising provisions in Section 503A when it passed the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA), Title I (The Compounding Quality Act). The DQSA also created outsourcing facilities under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which are drug compounders that voluntarily register with FDA and may produce compounded formulations for office use (at least one of which must be sterile), but must comply with FDAs cGMP regulations and other requirements set forth in Section 503B. Section 503B outsourcing facilities may also only compound from bulk substances if the product is on FDAs drug shortage list, or the substance is on FDAs Section 503B list of bulk substances that may be used in compounding (Bulk Substances List 1). 
 
15 


 While the FDA has been aggressively enforcing Section 503A since its re-enactment, compounders may still compound near copies of approved drug products, under Section 503A, so long as the prescriber makes a change to the compounded formulation that produces for that patient a significant difference between the commercially available drug and the compounded version. Compounders may also copy commercially available products if they do not do so in regular or inordinate amounts. In January 2018, FDA published a Final Guidance document titled, Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of a Commercially Available Drug Product Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This Final Guidance sets forth FDAs enforcement policy concerning those compounders that make essentially copies of commercially available drug products. FDA has defined the term regular or inordinate in the Final Guidance to mean: a drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product is compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts if it is compounded more frequently than needed to address unanticipated, emergency circumstances, or in more than the small quantities needed to address unanticipated, emergency circumstances. FDA has further stated it will not take enforcement action, considering all the facts and circumstances, against a compounder that compounds less than four essentially copies of a commercially available drug product in a calendar month. 
 Recently, Senator Bernie Sanders issued a public statement asking FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to allow pharmacies and manufacturers who were previously making 3,4-DAP to be permitted to resume providing it. We cannot assess the impact of this statement on our business. 
 We are taking all available steps to try to enforce our exclusivity rights. However, we cannot determine with certainty what impact these factors will have on the market for our product. While there can be no assurance, we expect that, despite these factors, we will be able to successfully market our product. 
 Generic Sabril®
Sabril® is marketed by Lundbeck in the United States for infantile spasms and for refractory complex partial seizures. Lundbecks sales of Sabril® (tablets and sachets) were approximately $229 million in 2017 and $204 million in 2018. One generic version of Sabril® tablets has been approved to date in the United States, as have numerous generic version of the powder form. We have entered into a definitive agreement with Endo/Par for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets. 
 Factors affecting competition generally 
 In general, our ability to compete will depend in large part upon: 
 

 | our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the demonstrated efficacy, safety and reliability of our drug candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the speed at which we develop drug candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to obtain reimbursement from private and/or public insurance entities for product use in approved indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | the availability of capital resources to fund our development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the federal government.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Matters 
 Government regulation and product approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, record-keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.

 In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state statutes. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to the FDAs good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before the trials are initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to, and acceptance by, the FDA of an NDA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 United States drug development process 
 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Prior to beginning human clinical trials, an IND sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical or non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the pre-clinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before any clinical trial commences at that institution. All research subjects must provide informed consent, and informed consent information must be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to initiation of the trial. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur. 
 
17 


 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases. A fourth, or post-approval, phase may include additional clinical studies. These phases generally include the following, and may be sequential, or may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are designed to determine the safety of usually single doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting intolerance, as well as evidence of the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In Phase 3, if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 (or occasionally Phase 1) studies, the Phase 3 studies will be conducted to further confirm clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded population which may involve geographically diverse clinical trial sites. Generally, but not always, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4 clinical trials are studies required of or agreed to by a sponsor that are conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement. Failure to promptly conduct Phase 4 clinical trials where necessary could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 tests are generally required for approval of an NDA, certain drugs may not require one or more steps in the process depending on other testing and the situation involved. Additionally, the FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may stop testing at any time if results show patients being exposed to unnecessary health risks or overly dangerous side effects. 
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other requirements, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 United States review and approval process 
 FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of the NDA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before accepting it for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The submission of an NDA is also subject to the payment of a substantial application fee (for FDA fiscal year 2019 this fee is $2,588,478), although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including when the drug that is subject of the application has received Orphan Drug Designation for the indication sought. Further, the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to an annual program fee, which for FDA fiscal year 2019 is $309,915 per prescription drug product. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, this annual program fee replaces the annual product and establishment fees. User fees typically increase annually. The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to determine whether its manufacturing is cGMPcompliant to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality, purity and stability. 
 
18 


 If the FDAs evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and often requires additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of a NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor. 
 Once an NDA is approved, changes to the conditions of approval, including additional indications, are made by the submission of a supplement to the NDA. The supplemental NDA, or sNDA, must contain all of the information necessary to support the change. In the case of a new indication, that information usually consists of at least one clinical trial, and often more. Like an NDA, FDA determines whether the sNDA is sufficiently complete to permit review before it files the sNDA. FDA then reviews the sNDA. Like an NDA, FDA can either approve the sNDA or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the sNDA. 
 Special Protocol Assessments 
 An SPA is a process in which sponsors may request to meet with the FDA to reach agreement on the design and size of certain clinical trials, clinical studies, or animal trials to determine if they adequately address scientific and regulatory requirements. As part of this process, sponsors submit specific questions about protocol design and scientific and regulatory requirements. After the FDA completes the review of an SPA request, the FDA may issue a SPA Letter, including an assessment of the protocol, agreement or non-agreement with the proposed protocol, and answers to the sponsors relevant questions. 
 An SPA agreement indicates concurrence by the FDA with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints, and planned analyses). These elements are critical to ensuring that the trial conducted under the protocol has the potential to support a future submitted applications ability to meet regulatory requirements for approval. Feedback on these issues provides the greatest benefit to sponsors in planning late-phase development strategy. However, an SPA agreement does not indicate FDA concurrence on every protocol detail. Further, the FDA may rescind an SPA if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the trial began. Thus, an SPA is not binding on the FDA if, for example, the Agency identifies a safety concern related to the product or its pharmacological class, if the FDA or the scientific community recognizes a paradigm shift in disease diagnosis or management, if the relevant data or assumptions provided by the sponsor in the SPA submission are found to be false or misstated, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA agreement and the data and results from the applicable clinical trial. 
 Because an SPA provides for the evaluation of protocols for trials that have not been initiated, the conduct and results of the subsequent trial are not part of the evaluation. Therefore, the existence of an SPA agreement does not guarantee that the FDA will accept an NDA, or that the trial results will be adequate to support approval. Those issues are addressed during the review of a submitted application; however, it is hoped that trial quality will be improved by the SPA process. 
 Post-approval requirements and consideration 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for the healthcare professionals, and other Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. 
 
19 


 Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicants product or approved methods of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug are then published in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDAs Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved products listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. A drug may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for the previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. During this period of exclusivity, FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. 
 
20 


 An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2), NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on FDAs previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDAs prior findings of safety and effectiveness or published literature is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies of the new product. 
 The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three years of marketing exclusivity to the same extent that a Section 505(b)(1) NDA is. 
 Abbreviated new drug applications 
 Generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA. The ANDA development process typically does not require new pre-clinical or clinical studies, but it does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved brand name reference listed drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the approved listed product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. A demonstration of bioequivalence means that the rate and extent of absorption of the ANDA drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the brand name reference listed drug when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions. 
 As noted above, generic drug products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection and non-patent market exclusivity for the reference listed drug. However, if an ANDA applicant is the first ANDA applicant to submit an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification, that ANDA may be eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity on approval. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances must be shared with other ANDA applicants with Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA sponsors of an application for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug. Under certain circumstances, eligibility for 180-day exclusivity may be forfeited. 
 Various types of changes to an approved ANDA must be requested in a prior approval supplement. In addition, some changes may only be approved only after new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied. In addition, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate that manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA cGMP requirements. Facilities, procedures, operations, and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and inspections to determine whether the systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. 
 There are also user fees for ANDA applicants, sponsors, and manufacturers. For fiscal year 2019, the application fees are $178,799 per ANDA application and the facility fees are $211,305 per domestic finished dosage form facility, $226,305 per foreign finished dosage form facility, $44,226 per domestic active pharmaceutical ingredient facility, and $59,226 per foreign active pharmaceutical ingredient facility. In addition, there is a new annual program fee based on the size of the generic drug applicant. These user fees typically increase each fiscal year. 
 
21 


 Other regulatory requirements 
 In addition to regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies, we are also subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the marketing of other products. Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory agencies. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will only be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory agency is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies as described above. 
 Under the European Union regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized manner. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Agency leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits marketing of the product throughout the European Union. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of nationally approved decisions and is used for products that do not comply with requirements for the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the European Union may submit further applications to other countries within the European Union, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization based on an assessment report provided by the country in which marketing authorization is held. 
 Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 
 In both United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private commercial health insurers and PBMs. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic or other studies in order to further demonstrate the value of our products. Even with the availability of such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than alternative products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates, in whole or in part. 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the Affordable Care Act). In fact, there continue to be efforts in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with another law, and President Trump has stated that he supports repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there is great uncertainty as to what changes will be made to United States healthcare laws and there can be no assurance how changes to those laws may affect our business. 
 We anticipate that in the United States, Congress, state legislatures, and private sector entities will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures could include: 
 

 | controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | controls on healthcare providers;
--+----------------------------------


 | controls on pricing of pharmaceutical products, including the possible reference of the pricing of United States drugs to non-United States drug pricing for the same product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reform of drug importation laws;
--+---------------------------------


 | entering into contractual agreements with payors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of use of managed-care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
22 


 We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. 
 Further, the pricing of pharmaceutical products generally, and particularly the pricing of orphan drugs, has recently received scrutiny from the press, from members of Congress in both parties, and from President Trump. Some members of the medical community and one U.S. Senator have also made statements in the press on the potential pricing of orphan drugs generally and on the pricing of our product specifically. The impact of this scrutiny on us and on the pricing of orphan drugs and other pharmaceutical products generally cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity and Pediatric Exclusivity Designation 
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An Orphan Drug Designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The grant of an Orphan Drug Designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has been granted Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 
 The orphan drug exclusivity contained in the ODA has been the subject of recent scrutiny from the press, from some members of Congress and from some in the medical community. There can be no assurance that the exclusivity granted in ODA to orphan drugs approved by the FDA will not be modified in the future, and as to how any such change might affect our products, if approved. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and seven-year orphan exclusivities. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If the FDA determines that information relating to the use of the new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in the population, the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDAs request and the reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application relying on the NDA sponsors data. 
 The European Orphan Drug Regulation is considered for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition afflicting five or fewer per 10,000 people in the EU, including compounds that for serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsors development investment. The medicinal product considered should be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Benefits of being granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation are significant, including eight years of data exclusivity, two years of marketing exclusivity and a potential one-year extension of both. The EU Community and Member States may not accept or grant for ten years a new marketing authorization or application for another drug for the same therapeutic indication as the orphan drug, although the ten year period can be reduced to six years if, after the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of the marketing exclusivity. A supplementary protection certificate may extend the protection six months beyond patent expiration if that is later than the orphan drug exclusivity period. To apply for the supplementary protection, a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, must be included in the market application. In Europe all drugs now seeking marketing authorization need to have a PIP agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before it can be approved, even if it is a drug being developed specifically for a pediatric indication. If a product is developed solely for use in the pediatric population, then a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization, or PUMA, may provide eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of marketing exclusivity.

 Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
 Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the fast track program features (see below for more details on fast track designation), as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance. Actions taken to expedite development may include the following actions, as appropriate: 

 | holding meetings with the sponsor and review team throughout the development of the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the non-clinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as possible;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. 
 Under the fast track program and FDAs accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drugs NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

 Priority Review 
 Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six to eight-month time frame from the time a complete NDA is submitted, if the drug candidate is intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. 
 Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws & the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, other state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of approved prescription drugs to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.

 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the United States Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), has imposed new track and trace requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product to system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug pedigree requirements under the PDMA, and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSAs new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
