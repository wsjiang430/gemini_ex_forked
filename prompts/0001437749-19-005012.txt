Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
First US Bancshares, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Bancshares”), is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). Bancshares operates one banking subsidiary, First US Bank, an Alabama banking corporation (the “Bank”). Prior to its name change on October 11, 2016, Bancshares was known as United Security Bancshares, Inc.
 
The Bank conducts a general commercial banking business and offers banking services such as demand, savings, individual retirement account and time deposits, personal and commercial loans, safe deposit box services and remote deposit capture. The Bank operates and serves its customers through 20 full-service banking offices located in Birmingham, Bucksville, Butler, Calera, Centreville, Columbiana, Gilbertown, Grove Hill, Harpersville, Jackson, Thomasville, Tuscaloosa and Woodstock, Alabama; Knoxville and Powell, Tennessee; and Rose Hill and Ewing, Virginia. 
 
In August 2017, the Bank opened its newly-constructed office complex, known as Pump House Plaza, along U.S. Highway 280 in the Birmingham, Alabama metro area. In October 2017, the Bank relocated its headquarters to the Pump House Plaza location, which now houses a full-service retail office of the Bank and offices for the Bank’s commercial lending and executive leadership teams.
 
On August 31, 2018, Bancshares completed the acquisition of The Peoples Bank (“TPB”) and then merged TPB with and into the Bank. In accordance with the transaction agreement, Bancshares acquired 100% of the capital stock of TPB for the purchase price of $23.4 million calculated on the net book value of TPB as of December 31, 2017 and a mutually agreed upon multiple of 1.62, less certain mutually agreed upon deductions that are described in the transaction agreement, which reduced the purchase price by approximately $0.4 million. Approximately 90% of the purchase price was paid in cash, which totaled approximately $20.7 million, and approximately 10% was paid in the form of unregistered shares of Bancshares’ common stock, which consisted of 204,355 shares. The aggregate purchase price was subject to adjustment following the closing date of the transaction based on determination of TPB’s final net book value as of the date of closing, which resulted in the payment by Bancshares of an additional cash amount of approximately $1.4 million. As of the acquisition date, TPB’s assets totaled $166.5 million, consisting primarily of pre-discounted gross loans totaling $156.8 million. Total deposits were $140.0 million. Purchase accounting adjustments were recorded as of the acquisition date, resulting in goodwill as of December 31, 2018 of $7.4 million.
 
The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries: Acceptance Loan Company, Inc. (“ALC”) and FUSB Reinsurance, Inc. (“FUSB Reinsurance”). As used herein, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Bancshares, as well as the Bank, ALC and FUSB Reinsurance, collectively. 
 
ALC, an Alabama corporation headquartered in Mobile, Alabama, is a finance company that performs both indirect lending through third-party retailers and conventional consumer finance lending through a branch network. ALC conducts indirect lending in 10 states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, with loans underwritten centrally at ALC’s headquarters location. ALC’s branch network serves customers through 21 offices located in Alabama and southeast Mississippi. ALC’s lending guidelines are based on an established company policy that is reviewed regularly by its Loan Committee. The lending guidelines include a consideration of collateral (age, type and loan-to-value) and loan term, as well as the borrower’s budget (debt-to-income ratio), employment and residence history, credit score, credit history and experience with ALC. 

FUSB Reinsurance underwrites credit life and credit accident and health insurance policies sold to the Bank’s and ALC’s consumer loan customers. FUSB Reinsurance is responsible for the first level of risk on these policies up to a specified maximum amount, and a primary third-party insurer retains the remaining risk. A third-party insurer and/or a third-party administrator are responsible for performing most of the administrative functions of FUSB Reinsurance on a contract basis. 
 
Employees
 
Bancshares has no employees, other than the executive officers discussed in the information incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 10 of this report. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 171 full-time equivalent employees, and ALC had 99 full-time equivalent employees. FUSB Reinsurance has no employees. None of our employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that the Company’s employee relations are good.
Competition
 
We face strong competition in making loans, acquiring deposits and attracting customers for investment services. Competition among financial institutions is based on interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with numerous other financial services providers, including commercial banks, online banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment banking companies, brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries operating in Alabama and elsewhere. Many of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks.
 
The financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries.
 
 2



Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 
We are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposit, brokerage and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and limit Bancshares’ ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from the Bank. Bancshares is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Alabama State Banking Department (the “ASBD”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of our activities.
 
To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of such provisions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal level. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, as well as the impact that such changes may have on us, are difficult to ascertain. A change in applicable laws and regulations, or in the manner in which such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations and earnings.
 
Regulation of Bancshares
 
Bancshares is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The BHCA requires a bank holding company to secure the approval of the Federal Reserve before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, or merges or consolidates with another bank or thrift holding company. Further, under the BHCA, the activities of a bank holding company and any nonbank subsidiary are limited to: (1) those activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto and (2) investments in companies not engaged in activities closely related to banking, subject to quantitative limitations on the value of such investments. Prior approval of the Federal Reserve may be required before engaging in certain activities. In making such determinations, the Federal Reserve is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition and gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices.
 
There are a number of restrictions imposed on us by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential losses to the depositors of the Bank and the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC (as discussed in more detail below) if the Bank should become insolvent. For example, the Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances in which they might not otherwise do so. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 
Any capital loan by Bancshares to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the Bank. In addition, in the event of Bancshares’ bankruptcy, any commitment by Bancshares to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as a subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, then insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority of payment over unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the institution’s holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit that they have made to such insured depository institution.
 
Regulation of the Bank
 
The operations and investments of the Bank are limited by federal and state statutes and regulations. The Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the ASBD and the FDIC and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types, amount and terms and conditions of loans that it may originate, and limits on the types of other activities in which the Bank may engage and the investments it may make.
 
The Bank is subject to federal laws that limit the amount of transactions between the Bank and its nonbank affiliates, including Bancshares, but excluding operating subsidiaries, such as ALC. Under these provisions, transactions by the Bank with nonbank affiliates (such as loans or investments) are generally limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for all covered transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all affiliates. Any extensions of credit to affiliates, with limited exceptions, must be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. The Bank is also prohibited from purchasing any “low quality” assets from an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) imposed additional requirements on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the length of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.  
 
Securities and Exchange Commission
 
Bancshares is under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for matters relating to the offer and sale of its securities and is subject to the SEC’s rules and regulations related to periodic reporting, reporting to shareholders, proxy solicitations and insider trading regulations.

Monetary Policy
 
Our earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a substantial effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Bank. The Federal Reserve has a significant impact on the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
Deposit Insurance
 
The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC. As a result, the Bank is required to pay periodic assessments to maintain insurance coverage for its deposits. Under the FDIC’s assessment system for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, the assessment rate is determined based on a number of factors, including the Bank’s CAMELS (supervisory) rating, leverage ratio, net income, non-performing loan ratios, OREO ratios, core deposit ratios, one-year organic asset growth and a loan mix index.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expense, results of operations, and cash flows. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Furthermore, deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Dividend Restrictions
 
Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid only out of the amount calculated as the present fair value of the total assets of the corporation, minus the present fair value of the total liabilities of the corporation, minus the capital of the corporation. In the event that there is no such amount, dividends may be paid out of the net profits of the corporation for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the immediately preceding fiscal year. Dividends may not be paid, however, out of net profits of the corporation if the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference on the distribution of assets is impaired. Further, the Federal Reserve permits bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if future retained earnings would be consistent with the company’s capital, asset quality and financial condition.
 
Since it has no significant independent sources of income, Bancshares’ ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. Under Alabama law, the Bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90% of its net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least 20% of capital. The Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Superintendent of the ASBD prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (1) the Bank’s net earnings for that year, plus (2) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. Alabama law defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal, state and local taxes. The Bank must be able to satisfy the conditions described above in order to declare or pay a dividend to Bancshares without obtaining the prior approval of the Superintendent of the ASBD. In addition, the FDIC prohibits the payment of cash dividends if (1) as a result of such payment, the bank would be undercapitalized or (2) the bank is in default with respect to any assessment due to the FDIC, including a deposit insurance assessment. These restrictions could materially influence the Bank’s, and therefore Bancshares’, ability to pay dividends.
 
Capital Adequacy
 
In July 2013, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted regulations to implement the framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”) for strengthening international capital and liquidity, known as “Basel III” (the “Basel III Rule”).  The Basel III Rule provides risk-based capital guidelines designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposures, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk-weights. The net amount of assets remaining after applying the risk-weights to the gross asset values represents the institution’s total risk-weighted assets (“RWA”). An institution’s total RWA are used to calculate its regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Rule establishes minimum capital and leverage ratios that supervised financial institutions are required to maintain, while also providing countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Under the Basel III Rule, banks must maintain a specified capital conservation buffer above each of the required minimum capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying certain discretionary bonuses. 
 
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as “Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets, which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. Leadership of the federal banking agencies who are tasked with implementing Basel IV has indicated that it is considering how to appropriately apply these revisions in the United States. Although it is uncertain at this time, some, if not all, of the Basel IV accord may be incorporated into the capital requirements framework applicable to Bancshares and the Bank.
 
Banking organizations must have appropriate capital planning processes, with proper oversight from the board of directors. Accordingly, pursuant to a separate, general supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are expected to conduct and document comprehensive capital adequacy analyses prior to the declaration of any dividends (on common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other Tier 1 capital instruments), capital redemptions or capital repurchases. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have adopted a joint agency policy statement, noting that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank’s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank’s capital adequacy.

In 2018, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Growth Act”) to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act.  While the Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. The Growth Act, among other things, requires the federal banking agencies to issue regulations allowing community bank organizations with total assets of less than $10.0 billion in assets and limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures to access a simpler capital regime focused on a bank’s Tier 1 leverage capital levels rather than risk-based capital levels that are the focus of the capital rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Act implementing Basel III.
 
Among other changes, the Growth Act expands the definition of qualified mortgages that may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8% and 10% to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios.  The Growth Act also includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.  It is difficult to predict at this time when or how any new standards under the Growth Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Growth Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
 
In November 2018, the federal banking agencies proposed regulations that would exempt a qualifying community bank and its holding company that have Tier 1 leverage ratios of greater than 9% from the risk-based capital requirements of the capital rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Act. A qualifying community banking organization and its holding company that have chosen the proposed framework would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements. A qualifying community banking organization would also be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be well capitalized for the agencies’ prompt corrective action rules provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%.
 
The rules implementing these provisions of the Growth Act are not yet finalized and Bancshares has not yet made a determination regarding whether it will seek to take advantage of these new capital rules under the Growth Act.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 
In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, federal law establishes a system of “prompt corrective actions” that federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions that they have discretion to take, based on the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized. Each institution is assigned to one of five categories based on its capital ratios:  “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Institutions categorized as “undercapitalized” or worse become subject to increasing levels of regulatory oversight and restrictions, which may include, among other things, limitations on growth and activities and payment of dividends. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. This classification is primarily for the purpose of applying the federal prompt corrective action provisions and is not intended to be, and should not be, interpreted as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects.
 
Community Reinvestment Act
 
The Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to assess all financial institutions that they regulate to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including their assessment area(s) (as established for these purposes in accordance with applicable regulations based principally on the location of the institution’s branch offices). Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “unsatisfactory.” An institution’s record in meeting the requirements of the CRA is made publicly available and is taken into consideration in connection with any applications that it files with federal regulators to engage in certain activities, including approval of branches or other deposit facilities, mergers and acquisitions, office relocations or expansions into non-banking activities. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
 
Under various federal laws, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act (also known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. These laws also mandate that financial institutions establish anti-money laundering programs meeting certain standards and require the federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, auditing, executive compensation and corporate reporting for entities with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and its implementing regulations established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for audit committees, imposed restrictions on the relationships between public companies and their outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services that auditors may provide), imposed additional responsibilities for public companies’ external financial statements on the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders. The requirements are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors. We and our Board of Directors have, as appropriate, adopted or modified our policies and practices in order to comply with these regulatory requirements and to enhance our corporate governance practices.
 
As required by Sarbanes-Oxley, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our Board, executives and employees. This Code of Business Conduct can be found on our website at http://www.firstusbank.com under the tabs “About – Investor Relations – FUSB Policies.”
 
Privacy of Customer Information
 
The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act” or the “GLBA”) and the implementing regulations issued by federal banking regulatory agencies require financial institutions to adopt policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions are required to explain to customers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, unless otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies and procedures. Specifically, the GLBA established certain information security guidelines that require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
Cybersecurity
 
The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (“CISA”) was intended to improve cybersecurity in the United States by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the U.S. government and private sector entities, including financial institutions. CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems notwithstanding any other provision of law and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from cyber-attacks. The law includes liability protections for companies that share cyber threat information with third parties so long as such sharing activity is conducted in accordance with CISA.
 
In October 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including Bancshares and the Bank. The proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector.
 
The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack.
 
State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located.

Regulation of Lending Practices
 
Our lending practices are subject to a number of federal and state laws, as supplemented by the rules and regulations of the various agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these laws. These include, among others, the following:

● | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities that it serves;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other specified factors in extending credit;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections and certain credit and other disclosures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring certain disclosures concerning loan closing costs and escrows, and governing transfers of loan servicing and the amounts of escrows in connection with loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties; and
● | Rules and regulations established by the National Flood Insurance Program. 

 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an independent bureau with broad authority to regulate the consumer finance industry, including regulated financial institutions, non-banks and others involved in extending credit to consumers. The CFPB has authority through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws.  Although the CFPB has the power to interpret, administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the federal banking regulatory agencies continue to have examination and enforcement powers over the financial institutions that they supervise relating to the matters within the jurisdiction of the CFPB if the supervised institutions have less than $10 billion in assets.  The CFPB has adopted a number of rules that impact our lending practices, including, among other things, (1) requiring financial institutions to make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that a consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay a residential mortgage loan before making such a loan, (2) requiring sponsors of asset-backed securities to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities (and generally prohibiting sponsors from transferring or hedging that credit risk), and (3) imposing a number of new and enhanced requirements on the mortgage servicing industry, including rules regarding communications with borrowers, maintenance of customer account records, procedures for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, servicing delinquent loans and conducting foreclosure proceedings, among other measures.
 
Regulation of Deposit Operations
 
Our deposit operations are subject to federal laws applicable to depository accounts, including, among others, the following:
 

● | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Truth-In-Savings Act, requiring certain disclosures for consumer deposit accounts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rules and regulations of the various agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these laws.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Home Loan Bank Membership
 
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLBA”). Each member of the FHLBA is required to maintain a minimum investment in the Class B stock of the FHLBA. The Board of Directors of the FHLBA can increase the minimum investment requirements if it concludes that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase the level of investment in the FHLBA depends entirely on the occurrence of a future event, we are unable to determine the extent of future required potential payments to the FHLBA at this time. Additionally, in the event that a member financial institution fails, the right of the FHLBA to seek repayment of funds loaned to that institution will take priority over the rights of all other creditors.
