ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory conditions. 
In August 2021, we entered into a transaction with Tay Therapeutics Ltd. (formerly known as In4Derm Ltd., "Tay") providing us with exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize products containing bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) inhibitors for the treatment of any disease, disorder or condition in humans. Through our access to this library of new chemical BET inhibitor compounds, we plan to develop product candidates for a diverse set of indications. Based on preclinical data generated to date, we have chosen to focus our initial efforts for this platform on select therapeutic areas in immuno-inflammatory disease.
Our lead program is VYN201, a locally administered pan-BET inhibitor designed as a “soft” drug to address diseases involving multiple, diverse inflammatory cell signaling pathways while providing low systemic exposure. To date, VYN201 has produced consistent reductions in pro-inflammatory and disease-related biomarkers, improvements in disease severity and a demonstrated local activity through several preclinical models. We believe that these data suggest potential broad utility for VYN201 across multiple routes of administration. In November 2022, we initiated a Phase 1a/b clinical trial evaluating a topical formulation of VYN201 for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo. In February 2023, we announced positive preliminary safety data from the Phase 1a portion of the trial. The first nonsegmental vitiligo patient was dosed in the Phase 1b portion of the trial in January 2023 and we expect topline results from this trial in mid-2023. 
Our second program is VYN202, a BD2-selective oral small molecule BET inhibitor. VYN202 is in preclinical development for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory indications, and is being designed to achieve class-leading selectivity (BD2 vs. BD1), maximum potency versus BD2 and optimal oral bioavailability. By maximizing BD2 selectivity, we believe VYN202 has the potential to be a more conveniently-administered non-biologic treatment option for both acute control and chronic management of immuno-inflammatory indications, where the damaging effects of unrestricted inflammatory signaling activity is common. 
We intend to actively evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships to advance our product candidates through the clinic toward commercialization, and may also partner with leading pharmaceutical companies to advance our molecules in therapeutic areas outside of our core focus in immunology. We believe selectively entering into collaborations has the potential to expand and accelerate the development of our programs and maximize the value of our pipeline.
BET Inhibition and Immuno-Inflammatory Disease
BET proteins are epigenetic enablers of transcription and regulate the expression of specific genes. Each BET protein consists of two bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) and one end terminal domain. BD1 and BD2 enable chromatin remodeling and recruit transcription factors to facilitate gene transcriptions. In certain cases, BET proteins activate oncogenes leading to increased cell proliferation and survival and an increase in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. BET inhibitors have the potential to downregulate the expression of such oncogenes. These observations have resulted in the generation and clinical investigation of BET inhibitors in several cancer subtypes by pharmaceutical companies, including large pharmaceutical companies. In addition to impacting oncogenetics, BET proteins regulate the expression of many immunity-associated genes and pathways by directing the transcription of a wide range of pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory genes, leading to increased cytokine expression that activate B cells and T cells and subsequent inflammatory processes. Inhibiting BET proteins prevents the formation of complexes required to facilitate transcription, thereby inhibiting the subsequent translation of the corresponding protein. As such, BET inhibitors could present as an attractive, non-steroidal, therapeutic option for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory diseases. 
Our Portfolio of Product Candidates
InhiBET BET Inhibitor Platform
Through our partnership with Tay, we have exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize products containing certain BET inhibitor compounds for the treatment of any disease, disorder or condition in humans. See "—Development and License Agreements—Tay License Agreements." Utilizing our InhiBET platform and through our preclinical and clinical activities, we are evaluating the impact that BET inhibitor compounds have on regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on this evaluation, we are targeting indications whose pathogenesis is linked to the proliferation of these specific cytokines, and we are developing formulations designed to maximize the anti-inflammatory effect of the drug while minimizing safety concerns. Through our InhiBET development platform, we believe we can demonstrate the potential utility of these BET inhibitor compounds and develop therapies for a variety of immuno-inflammatory conditions.
VYN201 - Locally Administered Pan-BD BET Inhibitor 
Our lead BET inhibitor candidate in development is VYN201. VYN201 was developed using the InhiBET platform and is a locally administered pan-BD BET inhibitor. It is a first-in-class “soft” pan-BD BET inhibitor that is being developed to address diseases involving multiple, diverse inflammatory cell signaling pathways. Our goal with the VYN201 program is to develop a therapy that delivers a potent, localized anti-inflammatory effect and is rapidly cleared through metabolic processes so as to avoid systemic absorption. 
To date, we have conducted several preclinical studies which have demonstrated VYN201's anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity and the ability to significantly reduce the expression of certain cytokines relevant to certain autoimmune diseases. Based on such data, we believe VYN201 has the potential to be highly versatile by serving as a locally acting therapy with low systemic exposure. 
Phase 1a/b Clinical Trial in Nonsegmental Vitiligo
Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune depigmenting disorder of the skin, characterized by the loss of pigment producing cells known as melanocytes. Vitiligo is the most common depigmenting skin condition, with a prevalence estimated at 0.5-2% of the world population. It is estimated that there are at least 1.9 million patients diagnosed with vitiligo in the United States, with the majority of patients (approximately 90%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo. There is currently only one FDA-approved product for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo which includes a black box safety warning. Based on preclinical data generated to date, we believe that VYN201 has the potential to offer a targeted, safe and more efficacious treatment option that lowers the disease recurrence rate and is effective for all skin tones and scar types.
In November 2022, we announced the commencement of a Phase 1a/b clinical trial evaluating VYN201 for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo. The Phase 1a/b clinical trial is being conducted in U.S.-based clinical centers. In the Phase 1a portion of the clinical trial, single ascending and multiple ascending doses of VYN201 were applied topically once daily to 30 healthy volunteers in five dose cohorts for two weeks with a one-week safety follow-up visit to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VYN201. Evaluated doses included VYN201 0.025%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% ointment strengths. There were no serious adverse events and no dose adjustments were required. There were no clinically relevant treatment 
emergent adverse events, abnormal clinical laboratory results or electrocardiogram findings. No healthy volunteers withdrew from the trial for any reason. Based on these results, we selected 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% ointment strengths for evaluation in the ongoing Phase 1b trial evaluating VYN201 in nonsegmental vitiligo patients. 
In January 2023, we dosed the first vitiligo patient in the Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1 trial. In the Phase 1b portion, up to 30 patients with a clinical diagnosis of nonsegmental vitiligo will receive VYN201 once daily for up to 16 weeks in three dose cohorts. Exploratory efficacy of VYN201 in nonsegmental vitiligo patients will be assessed, including pharmacodynamic biomarkers and photography. We expect topline results for the Phase 1b portion of the trial in mid-2023. 
Vitiligo Preclinical Model
In March 2022, we announced positive preclinical data in an ex vivo skin model of vitiligo. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential of VYN201 to (i) reduce Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (“MMP-9”) secretion (reducing the secretion of MMP-9 allows for melanocyte stabilization and limits loss of melanocytes/depigmentation in vitiligo); (ii) reduce soluble adhesion molecule, E-cadherin (soluble E-cadherin is a biomarker of melanocyte loss due to degradation of matrix-bound E-cadherin by MMP-9); (iii) minimize the loss of melanocytes by assessing melanin pigment content and (iv) affect the expression of genes commonly associated with melanogenesis (melanin synthesis, melanosome maturation and transport). In the preclinical model, VYN201 reduced the expression of key pro-inflammatory biomarkers relevant to the pathogenesis of vitiligo, and demonstrated marked reduction in melanocyte loss. Specifically, VYN201 produced a dose dependent reduction in MMP-9 and soluble E-cadherin and substantially reduced the loss of melanin pigment in the basal layers of skin at the 0.1% and 1% concentrations. In addition, VYN201 significantly upregulated WNT16, a member of the WNT family of genes. The WNT signaling pathway is known to be dysregulated in vitiligo and is believed to play a key role in melanocyte regeneration.
Th17 Inflammation Preclinical Model
Data suggests that T helper 17 (Th17) cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of a diverse group of immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma, among others. In October 2021, we evaluated the impact of VYN201 on Th17 mediated inflammation in a well-established preclinical animal model and an ex vivo human tissue study. In the animal model, depilated mice were topically dosed with imiquimod cream to induce a Th17 inflammation pathology over a 7-day induction phase. A further 7-day treatment phase evaluated three doses of VYN201 (0.001%, 0.01% and 0.1% concentrations) compared to a class 1 super-potent glucocorticosteroid product positive control (clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream) and vehicle control. Further, an imiquimod-naive control group (healthy control group) was included for VYN201 vehicle treatment. VYN201 significantly reduced the expression of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines relevant to Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases in the animal model and the ex vivo human tissue study. A dose-dependent improvement in the signs and symptoms of inflammation was observed for VYN201 treatment groups and treatment with VYN201 at all concentrations was well-tolerated. 
Fibrotic Tissue Preclinical Model
In November 2021, we announced results from a preclinical animal model in which we evaluated VYN201's ability to reduce fibrosis. In the preclinical study, duplicate identical skin incisions were induced on the flanks of hairless mice under anesthesia. The animals were topically dosed once daily with either 100mg VYN201 vehicle, VYN201 1%, or a hydroalcoholic gel (a negative control known to delay healing) until each lesion had completely healed. VYN201 demonstrated improvements in reducing fibrotic tissue mass and overall skin repair outcomes with no negative impact on healing time. Animals treated with VYN201 1% had a statistically significant decrease (improvement) in global external lesion severity score, a comprehensive evaluation of length, width, swelling and visibility of lesions, compared to those treated with hydroalcoholic gel, consistent with the vehicle control. In addition, animals treated with VYN201 1% had a significantly lower global internal lesion severity score than those treated with VYN201 vehicle or hydroalcoholic gel, indicative of an improved internal lesion outcome and a positive effect on reducing the formation of fibrotic tissue mass in the lesion bed.
Rheumatoid Arthritis Preclinical Model
In March 2022, we announced preclinical data showing that intra-articular injections of VYN201 resulted in significant inhibition of inflammation in a validated animal model of rheumatoid arthritis. In the preclinical study, inflammatory arthritis was induced in BALB/c mice by systemically injecting a mixture of four arthritogenic monoclonal antibodies against collagen II at day 1. In addition, the mice received a lipopolysaccharide injection systemically at day 4 to stimulate an acute systemic inflammatory response. Each treatment group (n=7 per group) was injected with either (i) an intra-articular dose of VYN201 vehicle, (ii) an intra-articular dose of VYN201, (iii) an intra-articular dose of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) or (iv) a systemic dose of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, via intraperitoneal injection). The intra-articular doses were administered on days 0, 3, 6 and 9 while the dexamethasone systemic injections were given daily beginning at day 0 through 11. For the VYN201 treatment groups, four doses of VYN201 were evaluated (at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg). Each animal treated with the 
intra-articular injections received the injection in the ankle of one rear paw. The untreated rear paw was assessed to evaluate any potential anti-inflammatory systemic effect. Treatment response was evaluated based on an assessment of paw thickening or swelling (in millimeters) and arthritis scoring based on a five-point composite severity scale of redness, swelling of the ankles and wrists, and paw thickness. Scoring in this model ranges from 0 (normal) to 4 (extensive signs and symptoms of arthritis). VYN201 demonstrated marked inhibition of paw thickening at the 1 and 10 mg/kg doses. At both doses, the inhibition of paw thickening was statistically significant in the treated paw relative to the untreated rear paw on day 12 (p<0.01). In addition, limbs treated with VYN201 at the 1 and 10 mg/kg dose levels had an average arthritis score of 0.57 and 0.67, respectively, or near normal. The arthritis score was significantly lower in the treated paw at both doses relative to the non-treated paws on day 12 (p<0.05).
VYN202 - Selective BET Inhibitor 
We are currently evaluating several BD2-selective oral small molecule BET inhibitors for our VYN202 program. Systemic BET inhibitors have historically targeted both BD1 and BD2 less selectively, causing gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities, such as thrombocytopenia. The compounds that we are currently evaluating for our VYN202 program are being designed to potentially reduce the therapeutic limiting toxicities of BRD4 BET inhibitors currently in development by optimizing BD2 versus BD1 selectivity. By maximizing BD2 selectivity, we believe VYN202 has the potential to present a more conveniently-administered non-biologic treatment option for both acute control and chronic management of immuno-inflammatory indications, where the damaging effects of unrestricted inflammatory signaling activity is common. Following the receipt of positive results from our preclinical activities evaluating these compounds, we intend to exercise our option with respect to the oral molecules. See "—Development and License Agreements—Agreements with Tay Therapeutics" for additional information. 
FMX114 
FMX114 is our proprietary investigational combination gel formulation of tofacitinib and fingolimod that is designed to address both the source and cause of inflammation in atopic dermatitis ("AD"). On August 10, 2022, we announced that our Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of FMX114 for mild-to-moderate AD did not meet its primary endpoint, which was based on assessments of the absolute and percent change relative to baseline in the atopic dermatitis severity index (“ADSI”) scoring assessment at week 4. In the weeks that followed, we performed additional analyses which showed that while efficacy results for FMX114 were not statistically significant at week 4, FMX114 was statistically superior to vehicle at weeks 1, 2 and 3 in the Phase 2a trial. Additionally, data received from the two-week open label extension during which both AD lesions of participating patients were treated with FMX114 showed that efficacy results continued to develop beyond week 4 of the trial and that the separation of treatment effect for lesions treated with FMX114 as compared to lesions treated with vehicle increased for lesions that had a higher ADSI score at baseline. Accordingly, we believe that FMX114 may have an improved overall treatment effect on patients with more severe disease at baseline and that FMX114 may have increased potential to effectively treat patients with more moderate-to-severe AD. We are evaluating partnering opportunities for this program and intend to focus our resources on the BET inhibitor development programs.
Divestiture of Minocycline Business
On January 12, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey”) pursuant to which we divested our Molecule Stabilizing Technology franchise ("MST Franchise"), including AMZEEQ, ZILXI, and FCD105, to Journey (the “Sale”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20.0 million and an additional $5.0 million on January 12, 2023, the one-year anniversary of the closing of the transaction. We are also eligible to receive sales milestone payments of up to $450.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified levels of net sales on a product-by-product basis, beginning with annual net sales exceeding $100,000,000 (with products covered in three categories (1) AMZEEQ (and certain modifications), (2) ZILXI (and certain modifications), and (3) FCD105 and other products covered by the patents being transferred, including certain modifications). In addition, we are entitled to receive certain payments from any licensing or sublicensing of the assets by Journey outside of the United States. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, as well as indemnification rights for breaches of representations, warranties, and covenants, as well as certain other matters, subject to customary deductibles, caps, and other limitations.
Manufacturing
We currently contract with third party manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active ingredients and finished products for our preclinical research and clinical trials for our product candidates. We currently have no plans to establish our own manufacturing capabilities and plan to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for any future trials of our product candidates.
We, together with our contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") have developed the validation processes, methods, tests and/or controls suitable for the manufacturing of our product candidates and for defining their properties. Development stage quantities of any products that we develop need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we may seek approval. We require all of our CMOs to comply with these requirements and currently employ internal and external resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. The relevant manufacturers of our product candidates for our current preclinical and clinical trials have advised us that they are compliant with both the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") and cGMP.
Development and License Agreements
Agreements with Tay Therapeutics 
On April 30, 2021, we entered into an Evaluation and Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Tay. Tay is a spin-out of the University of Dundee’s School of Life Sciences and has discovered and is developing proprietary BET inhibitors for the treatment of immunology and oncology conditions. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, Tay granted us an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize products containing Tay’s BET inhibitor compounds for the treatment of any disease, disorder or condition in humans. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to stabilize, develop and manufacture a product with a pan-BD BET inhibitor as its active ingredient and Tay agreed to provide a mutually agreed data package and select an NCE development candidate from its highly selective BET inhibitor compounds (the "Oral BETi Compounds"). We paid a $1.0 million non-refundable cash payment to Tay upon execution of the Option Agreement, 50% of which was to be used by Tay in the development of the Oral BETi Compounds.
Locally Administered Pan-BD BET Inhibitor Program (VYN201)
On August 6, 2021, we exercised our option with respect to the VYN201 program and, on August 9, 2021, the parties entered into a License Agreement (the “VYN201 License Agreement”) granting VYNE a worldwide, exclusive license that is sublicensable through multiple tiers to exploit certain of Tay’s pan-BD BET inhibitor compounds. We have the sole responsibility for development, regulatory, marketing and commercialization activities to be conducted for the licensed products at our sole cost and discretion. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and, if approved, commercialize such products. Pursuant to the VYN201 License Agreement, a joint development committee consisting of one representative from each party reviews the progress of the development plan for the licensed products. Pursuant to the VYN201 License Agreement, we may develop a product that contains or incorporates a specific BET inhibitor, whether alone or in combination with other active ingredients, in any form, formulation, presentation, or dosage, and for any mode of administration. 
We made a $0.5 million cash payment to Tay in connection with entering into the VYN201 License Agreement. Pursuant to the VYN201 License Agreement, we have agreed to make cash payments to Tay upon the achievement of specified clinical development and regulatory approval milestones with respect to each licensed topical product in the United States of up to $15.75 million for all indications. Tay is entitled to additional milestones upon the achievement of regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. In addition, with respect to any products we commercialize under the VYN201 License Agreement, we will pay tiered royalties to Tay on net sales of such licensed products by us, our affiliates, or sublicensees, of 5%, 7.5% and 10% based on tiered annual net sales bands subject to specified reductions. We are obligated to pay royalties until the later of (1) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the relevant licensed product, (2) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product in such country and (3) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis.
Selective BET Inhibitor Program (VYN202)
Under the Option Agreement, we have an exclusive option (the “Option”) to obtain certain exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize products containing Tay’s Oral BETi Compounds. Under the original terms of the Option Agreement, the Option was to expire upon the earlier of (i) 14 days following the delivery of an agreed data package and selection of a lead candidate by In4Derm and (ii) June 30, 2022 (the “Option Term”). On June 15, 2022, the parties entered into a letter agreement to extend the Option Term to February 28, 2023. We recently informed Tay that we require additional preclinical data in order to complete our assessment of the Oral BETi Compounds. In consideration of the significant progress made by the parties and our desire to maintain optionality with respect to our right to exercise the Option for the Oral BETi Compounds, the parties entered into a Letter Agreement on February 27, 2023 (the “Letter Agreement”) to extend the Option Term to April 30, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement, we agreed to pay Tay a non-refundable fee in the 
amount of $250,000 to extend the Option Term. This fee will be deducted from the $4.0 million payable to Tay in the event that we exercise the Option pursuant to the Option Agreement. 
In the event that we exercise the Option, the parties will sign a license agreement (the “Oral License Agreement”) and we will pay Tay a $4.0 million upfront cash payment, less the amount paid pursuant to the Letter Agreement. The Oral License Agreement will include cash payments of up to $43.75 million payable to Tay upon the achievement of specified clinical development and regulatory approval milestones with respect to each licensed oral product in the United States for all indications. Tay will be entitled to additional milestones upon the achievement of regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. In addition, with respect to any products we commercialize under the Oral License Agreement, we will pay tiered royalties to Tay on net sales of such licensed products by us, our affiliates, or sublicensees, of 5%, 7.5% and 10% based on tiered annual net sales bands subject to specified reductions.
LEO Pharma A/S for Finacea® Foam
In September 2015, Bayer HealthCare AG ("Bayer") began selling in the United States a product branded Finacea® Foam, based on our legacy foam technology. Finacea is a prescription topical drug which was developed through a collaboration between Foamix (our predecessor) and Bayer. Bayer sold the product to LEO Pharma A/S ("LEO") in 2018. Pursuant to the license agreement with LEO for Finacea, we are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of Finacea. In 2022, we received (or became entitled to receive) a total of $0.5 million in royalties from sales of Finacea from LEO.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property and proprietary technology are essential to the development of our product candidates. We are committed to protecting our intellectual property rights, core technologies and other know-how through a combination of patents, trademarks, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, copyrights, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, common interest agreements to protect privileged confidential information, licenses, assignments of invention and other contractual arrangements with our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, partners, suppliers, customers and others. Such agreements and rights may however be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, partners, or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
Our success will also depend at least in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While we are diligent in our efforts to investigate proprietary rights of third parties, no search is completely exhaustive. For example, a relevant patent or published application could escape detection because of unusual terminology or use of terminology that is still evolving in developing technological fields. Also, databases used in the searches may not be entirely complete. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop our current and future product candidates may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in derivation, interference or other proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") to determine derivation or priority of invention. We may also have to participate in court proceedings or arbitration to defend and assert our rights. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Our patent portfolio in relation to our VYN201 BET inhibitor program includes a granted patent in the UK and pending compound and composition patent applications in various jurisdictions worldwide that are licensed by us. In addition, we have filed a PCT application directed to various uses thereof. We have various non-provisional and nationally filed PCT patent applications pending in relation to FMX114 including applications filed in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and the US. Subject to filing a non-provisional, the PCT's being filed nationally, and the pending patent applications being granted (without terminal disclaimers) and payments of the appropriate maintenance fees, the patent applications in relation to VYN201 will expire in 2040 and 2042 and the patent applications related to FMX114 will expire in 2040, 2041 and 2043. 
In addition, in connection with our legacy business, we have various granted patents worldwide owned or licensed by us related to pharmaceutical compositions and their uses, including various foam-based platforms, various gel-based platforms, and other technology. 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to 
country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent or by patent term extension, which compensates a patentee for delays at the FDA. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its filing date; however, unlike in the United States, the European patent does not grant patent term adjustments. The European Union does have a compensation program similar to patent term extension called supplementary patent certificate that would effectively extend the duration of protection of the product for up to five years. Obtaining a patent term extension in the US or a supplementary patent certificate in the European Union is uncertain and will depend on eligibility and satisfying rigorous criteria in each jurisdiction.
Competition
Our drug development activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Our drug development activities also face, and may continue to face, governmental actions designed to promote generic drug competition and lower prices. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments, including those that may have achieved broad market acceptance, and any new treatment that may become available in the future.
Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and preclinical and clinical development than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our development programs.
For vitiligo, our primary competitors include topical therapies such as generic and branded versions of calcineurin inhibitors, including Elidel, marketed by Bausch Health; Opzelura, marketed by Incyte Corporation; branded and generic versions of high potency steroids, including Clobex, marketed by Galderma Laboratories, LP; and other treatments including various lasers and ultraviolet light-based therapies. In addition, there are several prescription product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat vitiligo and compete with VYN201, including but not limited to: topical cerdulatinib, under development by Dermavant Sciences, Inc., and both oral PF-06651600 and oral PF-06700841 under development by Pfizer Inc.
While we have not yet identified an initial indication for VYN202, there is intense competition for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory conditions. VYN202, if approved, will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
The commercial opportunity for our product candidates, if approved, could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drug we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than us, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before our product candidates are able to enter the market.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation. Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions is a significant factor in our research and development activities.
Product approval process in the United States
Review and approval of drugs
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and implementing regulations. In general, new drug products require the submission of a NDA and approval thereof by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions and enforcement actions brought by the FDA, the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. Possible sanctions may include the FDA’s refusal to 
approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA prior to marketing and distributing a new drug product in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated at that site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice ("GCP") requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA or supplemental NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product or components thereof are produced, to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites and the sponsor’s clinical trial records to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•payment of user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Preclinical studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.
Clinical trials in support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which, in some cases, may overlap or be combined:
•Phase I: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
•Phase II: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase III: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Submission of a NDA to the FDA
The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture, control and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") as amended, applicants are required to pay fees to the FDA for reviewing an NDA. These user fees, as well as the annual fees required for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. Each NDA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following submission of the application. If found complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thus triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most NDAs for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
Before approving a NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured or facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and distribution process, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory at such facilities. The FDA may deny approval of a NDA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional testing or information, which can delay the approval process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or may never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval will specify the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed in the United States pursuant to that NDA, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies or trials be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies ("REMS"), or may impose other limitations. After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including any advisory committee recommendation, if applicable, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or non-clinical testing in a resubmission to the NDA in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. FDA has committed to reviewing such submissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included in the resubmission. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product.
Once a product is approved, marketing the product for other indicated uses or making certain manufacturing or other changes requires FDA review and approval of a supplemental NDA or a new NDA, which may require additional clinical data and review fees. In addition, further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product may be required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur at any time following approval. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted.
In addition, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation for a drug if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product including involvement of senior managers, and, like fast track products, are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. Both fast track and breakthrough therapy products are also eligible for accelerated approval and/or priority review, if relevant criteria are met.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
Once a NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, for NDAs for new molecular entities, these six- and ten- month review periods are measured from the 60-day filing date rather than the receipt date, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to request and potentially receive a priority review. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on responding to requests for expanded access. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Post-approval requirements
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. Certain requirements include, inter alia, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” and other promotional activities, such as those considered to be false or misleading. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Such enforcement may also lead to scrutiny and enforcement by other government and regulatory bodies.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not encourage, market or promote such off-label uses. As a result, “off-label promotion” has formed the basis for litigation under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") violations of which are subject to significant civil fines and penalties. In addition, under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, manufacturers of certain prescription products are required to disclose annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") payments or transfers of value made to “covered recipients” and teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interests held by covered recipients and their immediate family members. Reportable payments and transfers of value may be direct or indirect, in cash or kind, for any reason, and are required to be disclosed even if the transfers are not related to an approved product. Failure to comply with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act could result in penalties up to $1.15 million per year.
The manufacturing of any of our product candidates, if approved, will be required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. The FDA’s cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. These entities are further subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions or other consequences for a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions or consequences may include untitled or warning letters, recalls, suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, and continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a “consent decree,” which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, or Phase IV testing, as well as REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of approved products.
Pediatric trials and exclusivity
Even when not pursuing a pediatric indication, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (the "FDASIA") in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FDASIA.
Separately, in the event the FDA makes a written request for pediatric data relating to a drug product, an NDA sponsor who submits such data may be entitled to pediatric exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional 6 months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity.
Patent term restoration and extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, generally referred to as the “Hatch-Waxman Act,” which permits an extension of the term of a patent for up to five years to compensate patent holders for marketing time lost while developing the product and awaiting government approval during the FDA regulatory review. The basis for the patent extension is the regulatory review period, which is basically composed of two parts, a testing phase and an approval phase, less a reduction, if any, in either part for a period time where there was a finding of lack of due diligence. The restoration period granted can be up to one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA (testing phase), plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date (approval phase). Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. In other words, the total maximum patent life for the product with the patent extension cannot exceed 14 years from the products approval date, which amounts to 14 years of potential marketing time. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question and within 60 days of FDA approval. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals and the scope of the extended patent is limited to the approved drug. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. The term of a patent which claims a human drug product, a method of using the product, or a method of manufacturing the product may potentially be extended if it satisfies the various conditions including that it is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug. 
Review and approval of drug products outside the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can be subject to uncertainties, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Regulation in the European Economic Area
In the European Economic Area ("EEA") which is composed of the Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization ("MA").
There are two types of MAs:
•The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") of the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application ("MAA") is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
Prior to obtaining an MA in the EEA, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan ("PIP") approved by the EEA regulatory agency, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EEA regulatory agency has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
In the EEA, upon receiving a MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EEA from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EEA regulatory agencies to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product and any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and other markets, sales of any product, and any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication.
Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payor may not consider a product to be medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, or that other payors will similarly provide similar coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers pay quarterly rebates to each state Medicaid agency. Generally, for branded prescription drugs marketed under NDAs, manufacturers are required to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between such price and the best price during a specified period. An additional rebate for products marketed under NDAs is payable if the average manufacturer price increases at a rate higher than inflation, and other methodologies apply to new formulations of existing drugs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA") revised certain definitions used for purposes of calculating the rebates, including the definition of “average manufacturer price.” Various state Medicaid programs have implemented voluntary supplemental drug rebate programs that may provide states with additional manufacturer rebates in exchange for preferred status on a state’s formulary or for patient populations that are not included in the traditional Medicaid drug benefit coverage.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies or trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, and particularly on prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, the then President of the United States signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the ACA. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. This comprehensive legislative overhaul was expected to extend coverage to approximately 36 million previously uninsured Americans. The ACA also requires the pharmaceutical industry to share in the costs of reform by increasing Medicaid rebates and expanding Medicaid rebates to cover Medicaid managed care programs, among other things. The ACA also includes funding of pharmaceutical costs for Medicare patients in excess of the prescription drug coverage limit and below the catastrophic coverage threshold.
There have been executive, judicial, Congressional, and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the ACA's individual mandate was repealed by Congress in The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which was signed into law in December 2017 and became effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Ultimately, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that state and individual plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the individual mandate provision of the ACA; in so holding, the Supreme Court did not consider larger constitutional questions about the validity of this provision or the validity of the ACA in its entirety. In addition, there have been a number of health reform initiatives by the Biden administration that have impacted the ACA. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that there will be additional health reform measures. It is unclear how any such challenges, if any, and other efforts to modify, repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, including several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, expedite generic competition, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. In addition, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We anticipate that these and other healthcare reform efforts will continue to result in additional downward pressure on drug pricing. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, third party payors and other customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or 
specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, under the ACA, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil FCA. Additionally, many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors. Violations of the federal or state anti-kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal and state health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Even where pharmaceutical companies do not submit claims directly to payors, they can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, marketing products of sub-standard quality, or paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services. In addition, activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for pharmaceutical products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for such products, and the sale and marketing of such products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Private individuals or whistleblowers can bring FCA “qui tam” actions on behalf of the government and may share in amounts recovered. Proof of intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including any third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making false statements relating to healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH") and their implementing regulations, which imposes privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to individually identifiable health information including PHI, upon “covered entities” subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that perform services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, including PHI. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Other federal and state laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, also impose requirements with respect to individuals' personal information;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs, devices and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, certain other healthcare professionals (such as nurse practitioners and physicians assistants), and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, Section 6004 of the ACA requires annual reporting of information about drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply more broadly than their U.S. federal analogues, such as to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require drug companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and local laws that require the licensure of sales representatives; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing or payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States 
(such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which became effective in May 2018); state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or consent decree, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our strategy.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions governing, among other things, (i) the use, storage, registration, handling, emission and disposal of chemicals, waste materials and sewage; and (ii) chemical, air, water and ground contamination, air emissions and the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals, waste materials and sewage. 
These laws, regulations and permits could potentially require the expenditure by us of significant amounts for compliance or remediation. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines and other civil, administrative or criminal sanctions, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In addition, we may be required to pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third party claims, including those relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous substances we use, store, handle, transport, manufacture or dispose of), property damage or contribution claims. Some environmental, health and safety laws allow for strict, joint and several liability for remediation costs, regardless of comparative fault. We may be identified as a responsible party under such laws. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters are often subject to change. In the event of any changes or new laws or regulations, we could be subject to new compliance measures or to penalties for activities which were previously permitted. 
The operations of our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters, and their failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, result in an interruption or delay in the development or manufacture of our product candidates, or increase the costs for the development or manufacture of our product candidates.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 12 full-time employees. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors and consultants to support our organization. We believe our internal R&D capabilities coupled with our third-party R&D consultants are well positioned to execute our pipeline strategy in a cost effective manner. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
Attracting, retaining and developing employees from a diverse range of backgrounds to support our research, development and clinical activities is an integral part of our human capital strategy and we believe we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages.
