The Spin-off and Related Transactions
 
We are a Delaware corporation that provides alternative investment management, institutional research and underwriting services. In addition, we derive investment income/(loss) from proprietary investment of cash and other assets awaiting deployment in our operating business.
 
On November 30, 2015, GAMCO Investors, Inc. (“GAMCO” or “GBL”) distributed all the outstanding shares of each class of AC common stock on a pro rata one-for-one basis to the holders of each class of GAMCO’s common stock (the “Spin-off”).

  Index
We conduct our investment management operations through Gabelli & Company Investment Advisers, Inc. (“GCIA” f/k/a Gabelli Securities, Inc.). GCIA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gabelli & Partners, LLC (“Gabelli & Partners”), collectively serve as general partners or investment managers to investment funds including limited partnerships and offshore companies (collectively, “Investment Partnerships”), and separate accounts. We primarily manage assets in equity event-driven value strategies, across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios. The business earns management and incentive fees from its advisory activities. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of assets under management (“AUM”). Incentive fees are based on a percentage of the investment returns of certain clients’ portfolios. GCIA is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”).
 
We provide institutional research services through G.research, LLC ("G.research"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. G.research is a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act and also acts as an underwriter primarily for affiliates of the Company. G.research is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).
 
In connection with the Spin-off, GAMCO issued a promissory note (the “GAMCO Note”) to AC Group in the original principal amount of $250 million used to partially capitalize the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2018, AC received principal repayments totaling $50 million on the GAMCO Note which fully satisfied the outstanding principal balance. The GAMCO Note bore interest at 4% per annum and had an original maturity date of November 30, 2020.
 
In addition, AC Group received 4,393,055 shares of GAMCO Class A common stock for $150 million in connection with the Spin-off. Following two share exchange offers during 2018, the Company continues to hold 3,016,501 of these shares as of December 31, 2018.
 
Alternative Investment Management
 
We primarily manage assets in equity event-driven value strategies, across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios. The business earns fees from its advisory activities, and income/(loss) from investment portfolio activities. The advisory fees include management and incentive fees. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of AUM. Incentive fees are based on a percentage of profits derived from the investment performance of certain clients’ accounts. As of December 31, 2018, we managed approximately $1.5 billion in assets.
 
In our event-driven value funds, we seek investments trading at prices that differ from those determined using our proprietary “Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst™” methodology where we have identified a near-term catalyst that is expected to narrow the market difference to PMV. Catalysts can include a spin-off, stock buyback, asset sale, management change, regulatory change or accounting change.
 
In event merger arbitrage, the goal is to earn absolute positive returns regardless of the direction of the overall equity markets. We have compounded net annual returns of 7.41% since we launched our first partnership dedicated to investing in merger arbitrage situations in February 1985. As a result, $10 million invested in this fund at its inception would today be worth more than $113 million without considering taxes. In addition, the value of such an investment would have exhibited significantly less volatility than that of broad equity indices.
 
The arbitrage investment process generally begins with the announcement of an acquisition where an acquirer makes an offer for all of a target company’s stock. The target’s shares usually trade at a discount, or spread, to the final deal price because of the time value of money, regulatory approval risks and other risks specific to the companies in the transaction.
 
Our role as arbitrageurs is to quantify and assess the risks to the transaction, make investments that compensate our investors for these risks, and earn a satisfactory return.
 
Our typical investment process involves buying shares of the target at a discount, earning the spread to the deal price when the deal closes, and reinvesting the profits in new deals in a similar manner. By owning a diversified portfolio of deals, we mitigate the adverse impact of deal-specific risks.
 
 5
 
  Index
We expect rising interest rates will boost returns in merger arbitrage in the form of wider spreads, given the time value of money component of the deal spread.
 
We generally manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in a variety of U.S. and foreign securities. Our managed funds primarily employ absolute return strategies with the objective of generating positive returns regardless of market performance.
 
We introduced our first alternative fund, a merger arbitrage partnership, Gabelli Arbitrage (renamed Gabelli Associates), in February 1985. An offshore version of the event merger arbitrage strategy was added in 1989. Building on our strengths in global event-driven value investing, several new investment funds have been added to balance investors’ geographic, strategy and sector needs. Today, we manage funds in multiple categories, including event merger arbitrage, event-driven value and other strategies.
 
We serve a wide variety of investors including private wealth management accounts, corporations, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, foundations and endowments, as well as serving as sub-advisor to certain third-party investment funds.

Institutional Research Services
 
Through G.research, we provide institutional research services and act as an underwriter. G.research is regulated by FINRA. G.research’s revenues are derived primarily from institutional research services, underwriting fees and selling concessions. Our research analysts are industry-focused, following sectors based on our core competencies. They research companies across market capitalizations on a global basis. The primary function of the research team is to gather data, array the data, and then project and interpret the data in order to make informed investment recommendations. Analysts publish their insights in the form of research reports and daily notes. In addition, G.research hosts conferences which bring together industry leaders and institutional investors. The objective of institutional research services is to provide superior investment ideas to investment decision makers.
 
Analysts are generally assigned to industry sectors, overseen by a senior analyst, whose role is to ensure a consistent process and enhance idea cross-fertilization and knowledge-sharing. Our research focus includes Basic Materials – Specialty Chemicals; Business Services; Consumer Staples – Beverage, Supermarkets & Specialty Retail; Energy Services; Financials – Community Banks; Financials – Investment Services; Healthcare – Animal Health, Biotech & Pharma; Biotech; Industrials – Housing; Industrials – Diversified Industrials, Transports & Metals; Industrials & Internet; Media – Entertainment; Media; Technology; and Global Telecommunications.
 
G.research generates revenues via direct fees and commissions on securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of clients. Clients include institutional investors (e.g., hedge funds and asset managers) as well as affiliated mutual funds and managed accounts. Institutional research services revenues totaled $8.3 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

  Index
A significant portion of our institutional research services are provided to GAMCO and its affiliates. Pursuant to research services agreements, GAMCO Asset Management Inc. paid $1.0 million and $2.2 million and Gabelli Funds, LLC paid $1.0 million and $2.3 million to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Gabelli Funds, LLC and GAMCO Asset Management Inc. are wholly-owned subsidiaries of GAMCO. G.research earned $3.8 million and $4.5 million, or approximately 62% and 60%, of its commission revenue from transactions executed on behalf of funds advised by Gabelli Funds, LLC, and clients advised by GAMCO Asset Management Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We can provide no assurance that GAMCO and its affiliates will continue to use our institutional research to the same extent in the future. G.research continues to pursue expansion of third party and affiliated activities.
 
In April 2018, the Board of Directors announced that it authorized the Company to explore strategic options for the institutional research services operations. Among the options being considered is the spin-off of the broker-dealer to the shareholders as well as a management-led buyout. The Company can provide no assurances that a transaction will result.
 
Use of Resources
 
We have a substantial portfolio of cash and investments. We expect to use this proprietary investment portfolio to provide seed capital for new products, expand our geographic presence, develop new markets and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances, as well as for shareholder compensation in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our proprietary portfolios are largely invested in products we manage or that are managed by GAMCO. In addition, we expect to make private equity acquisitions including through the use of special purpose acquisition vehicles (“SPACs”).
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy targets global growth of the business through continued leveraging of our proven asset management strengths including the long-term performance record of our alternative investment funds, diverse product offerings and experienced investment, research and client relationship professionals. In order to achieve performance and growth in AUM and profitability, we are pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements:
Continuing an Active Fundamental Investment Approach
 
We began managing hedge fund assets in 1985, when we launched our first merger arbitrage fund. Our results through market cycles clearly demonstrate our core competence in event driven investing. Our “Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst™” investing approach remains the principal management philosophy guiding our investment operations. This method is based on investing principles articulated by Graham & Dodd, and further refined by our Executive Chairman, Mario J. Gabelli.
Growing our Investment Partnerships Advisory Business
 
We intend to grow our Investment Partnerships advisory operations by gaining share with existing products and introducing new products within our core competencies, such as event and merger arbitrage. In addition, we intend to grow internationally.
Capitalizing on Acquisitions and Alliances - Direct Investments
 
We intend to leverage our research and investment capabilities by pursuing acquisitions and alliances that will broaden our product offerings and add new sources of distribution. In addition, we may make direct investments in operating businesses using a variety of techniques and structures. For example, in April 2018, the Company completed a €110 million initial public offering of its first special purpose acquisition corporation, the Gabelli Value for Italy S.p.a., an Italian company listed on the London Stock Exchange’s Borsa Italiana AIM segment under the symbol “VALU”. VALU was created to acquire a small- to medium-sized Italian franchise business with the potential for international expansion, particularly in the United States.

  Index
Pursuing Partnerships and Joint Ventures
 
We plan to pursue partnerships and joint ventures with firms that fit with AC’s product quality and that can provide Asian/European distribution capabilities that would complement our U.S. equity product expertise. We expect to target opportunities for investors interested in non-market correlated returns.
Growing our Institutional Research Services Operations
 
We intend to grow our Institutional Research Services by growing our client base and by increasing our interactions with existing clients to generate greater trading activity and payment flow.
Commitment to Community
 
AC seeks to be a good corporate citizen in our community through the way we conduct our business activities as well as by other measures such as serving our community, sponsoring local organizations and developing our teammates.
 
Over its first two years as a public company, AC supported nearly 100 qualified charities that address a broad range of local, national and international concerns. The recipients were identified by our shareholders through AC’s Shareholder-Designated Contribution Program. The 2018 program, approved by our Board in November 2018, allows each shareholder of record at year-end to designate a qualified charity to receive a $0.25 per share donation from AC. We expect that the Company’s total contributions for the 2018 program will be approximately $5 million bringing cumulative donations to approximately $15 million.
 
Competition
 
The alternative asset management industry is intensely competitive. We face competition in all aspects of our business from other managers in the United States and around the globe. We compete with alternative investment management firms, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives. Many of these investment management firms are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies and may have access to greater resources than us. Many are larger in terms of AUM and revenues and, accordingly, have larger investment and sales organizations and related budgets. Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of the long-term investment performance of our investment products. We have recently taken steps to increase our distribution channels, brand awareness and marketing efforts.
 
The market for providing investment management services to institutional and private wealth management clients is also highly competitive. Selection of investment advisors by U.S. institutional investors is often subject to a screening process and to favorable recommendations by investment industry consultants. Many of these investors require their investment advisors to have a successful and sustained performance record, often five years or longer, and focus on one-year and three-year performance records. Currently, we believe that our investment performance record would be attractive to potential new institutional and private wealth management clients. While we have significantly increased our AUM from institutional investors since our entry into the institutional asset management business, no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain new business will be successful.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Service marks and brand name recognition are important to our business. We have rights to the service marks under which our products are offered. We have rights to use the “Gabelli” name, and the “GAMCO” brand, pursuant to a non-exclusive, royalty-free license agreement we have entered into with GAMCO (the “Service Mark and Name License Agreement”). We can use these names with respect to our funds, collective investment vehicles, Investment Partnerships and other investment products pursuant to the Service Mark and Name License Agreement. The Service Mark and Name License Agreement has a perpetual term, subject to termination only in the event we are not in compliance with its quality control provisions. Pursuant to an assignment agreement signed in 1999, Mario J. Gabelli had assigned to GAMCO all of his rights, title and interests in and to the “Gabelli” name for use in connection with investment management services and institutional research services. In addition, the funds managed by Mario J. Gabelli outside GAMCO and AC have entered into a license agreement with GAMCO permitting them to continue limited use of the “Gabelli” name under specified circumstances.

Regulation
 
Virtually all aspects of our businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and investors, the financial markets and the customers of broker-dealers. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisors and broker-dealers have broad powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit such an advisor or broker-dealer from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. In such an event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, injunctions, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of the investment advisor and other registrations, censures and fines.
Existing U.S. Regulation Overview
 
AC and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor, FINRA and other regulatory bodies. Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to anti-terrorist financing, privacy, and anti-money laundering regulations as well as economic sanctions laws and regulations established by these agencies.
The Advisers Act
 
GCIA is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and is regulated by and subject to examination by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisors including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record keeping, operational and marketing requirements. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment advisor’s registration. The failure of GCIA to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We derive a majority of our revenues from investment advisory services from investment management agreements. Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent.
 
Broker-Dealer and Trading and Investment Regulation
 
G.research is a registered as broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation by FINRA and various states’ regulatory authorities. In its capacity as a broker-dealer, G.research is required to maintain certain minimum net capital amounts. These requirements also provide that equity capital may not be withdrawn, advances to affiliates may not be made or cash dividends paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met. G.research’s net capital, as defined, met or exceeded all minimum requirements as of December 31, 2018. As a registered broker-dealer, G.research is also subject to periodic examination by FINRA, the SEC and the state regulatory authorities.
 
Our trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations. These laws and regulations govern such items as trading on inside information, market manipulation, technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations), and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our activities and damage our reputation.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”)
 
Subsidiaries of AC are subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.
Anti-Tax Evasion Legislation
 
Our global business may be impacted by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) which was enacted in 2010 and introduced expansive new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring U.S. persons with financial assets outside of the United States pay appropriate taxes. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) between the United States and the countries in which we do business or have accounts. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded.
 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to address the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of information regarding financial accounts. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with partner jurisdictions on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. As a result, the Investment Partnerships will be required to report information on the investors of the Partnerships to comply with the CRS due diligence and reporting requirements, as adopted by the countries in which the Investment Partnerships are organized.
 
The FATCA and CRS rules will impact both U.S. and non-U.S. Investment Partnerships and separately managed accounts and subject us to extensive additional administrative burdens. Our business could also be impacted to the extent there are other changes to tax laws such as the recent tax reform legislation. Such changes could adversely affect our financial results.
 
The Patriot Act
 
The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain some similar provisions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.
Laws and Other Issues Relating to Taking Significant Equity Stakes in Companies
 
Investments by AC, its affiliates, and those made on behalf of their respective advisory clients and Investment Partnerships often represent a significant equity ownership position in an issuer’s equity. This may be due to the fact that AC is deemed to be a member of a “group” that includes GAMCO and, therefore, may be deemed to beneficially own the securities owned by other members of the group under applicable securities regulations. As of December 31, 2018, by virtue of being a member of the group, AC was deemed to hold five percent or more beneficial ownership with respect to 102 equity securities. This activity raises frequent regulatory, legal and disclosure issues regarding our aggregate beneficial ownership level with respect to portfolio securities, including issues relating to issuers’ stockholder rights plans or “poison pills;” various federal and state regulatory limitations, including (i) state gaming laws and regulations, (ii) federal communications laws and regulations; (iii) federal and state public utility laws and regulations, as well as federal proxy rules governing stockholder communications; and (iv) federal laws and regulations regarding the reporting of beneficial ownership positions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

Potential Legislation Relating to Private Pools of Capital
 
We manage a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to: investor eligibility; trading activities, record-keeping and reporting; the scope of anti-fraud protections; safekeeping of client assets; tax treatment; and a variety of other matters. AC may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.
Existing European Regulation Overview
 
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
 
Our European activities are impacted by the European Union’s (“EU”) Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”). AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and, potentially, outside the EU. AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area. AIFMD’s requirements restrict AIF marketing and impose additional compliance and disclosure obligations on AC regarding items such as remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, domicile of custodians and liquidity management. These compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements will subject us to additional expenses.
Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities
 
The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) impacting depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, seeks to align the depositary regime, remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under the UCITS Directive with the requirements of AIFMD.
 
Similarly, the European Securities and Markets Authority recently revised its guidelines for exchange-traded and other UCITS funds. These guidelines introduced new collateral management requirements for UCITS funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management (“EPM”) techniques (including securities lending) and over-the-counter derivative transactions. These rules required us to make changes to our collateral management arrangements applicable to the EPM of the UCITS funds for which GCIA acts as a sub-advisor. Compliance with the UCITS directives will cause us to incur additional expenses associated with new risk management and reporting requirements.
 
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
 
The EU’s revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), which was fully implemented in 2018, created specific new rules regarding the use of “soft dollars” to pay for research. A MiFID licensed investment firm that provides portfolio management services or independent investment advisory services to clients may not pay for third-party research with soft dollars generated through client trading activity. Research must be paid for either (i) by the investment firm out of its own resources or (ii) through a separate research payment account for each client to pay for the research. While currently neither GCIA nor G.research is directly subject to MiFID II: (a) GCIA may be invoiced separately by any EU brokers from whom it purchases research in the future; (b) clients may begin to require that GCIA “unbundle” research payments from commission trading; and (c) EU-based clients of G.research may also demand that G. research separately invoice them for trading and research.
 
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) currently regulates Gabelli Securities International (UK) Limited (“GSIL UK”), our MiFID licensed entity in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FCA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA’s rules adopted under that Act provide requirements dealing with a firm’s capital resources, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. The FCA supervises GSIL UK through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic-based reviews in order to monitor our compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against GSIL and/or its employees.
 
 11
 
  Index
In addition, GSIL UK must comply with MiFID II which sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. MiFID II also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms set out in the Capital Requirements Directive. This directive includes requirements not only on capital, but also governance and remuneration as well. The obligations introduced through these directives will have a direct effect on some of our European operations.
 
Our EU-regulated entities are additionally subject to EU regulations on OTC derivatives which require (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts.
 
Regulatory Matters Generally
 
The investment management industry is likely to continue to face a high level of regulatory scrutiny and to become subject to additional rules designed to increase disclosure, tighten controls and reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the SEC has substantially increased its use of focused inquiries which request information from investment advisors regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities laws. We participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course of our business. Changes in laws, regulations and administrative practices by regulatory authorities, and the associated compliance costs, have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material adverse impact. Although we have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants and lawyers to assist us in adhering to regulatory guidelines and satisfying these requirements, and maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses, there can be no assurance that the precautions and procedures that we have instituted and installed, or the insurance that we maintain to protect ourselves in case of client losses, will protect us from all potential liabilities.
Employees
 
On March 1, 2019, we had a full-time staff of 62 teammates, of whom 35 served in the portfolio management, research and trading areas, 14 served in the marketing and shareholder servicing areas and 13 served in the finance, legal, operations and administrative areas. We also avail ourselves of services provided by GAMCO in accordance with a transitional services agreement that was entered into with GAMCO as part of the Spin-off.
Status as a Smaller Reporting Company and an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. As a result, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “smaller reporting companies.” We will, in general, remain a smaller reporting company unless the market value of AC common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
 
In addition, we are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). As a result, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
 12
 
  Index
We will, in general, remain as an emerging growth company for up to five full fiscal years following the Spin-off. We would cease to be an emerging growth company and, therefore, become ineligible to rely on the above exemptions, if (1) we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue in a fiscal year; (2) we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period; or (3) the market value of AC common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
 
We may take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us as long as we qualify as a smaller reporting company or an emerging growth company, except that we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.
