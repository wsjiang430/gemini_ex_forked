Introduction
 
Hecla Mining Company and our subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to the U.S. and worldwide since 1891 (in this report, “we” or “our” or “us” refers to Hecla Mining Company and our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise). We discover, acquire, develop, and produce silver, gold, lead and zinc.  In doing so, we intend to manage our business activities in a safe, environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner.
 
We produce lead, zinc and bulk concentrates, which we sell to custom smelters and brokers, and unrefined doré containing gold and silver, which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders.  We are organized and managed in five segments that encompass our operating units: the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, San Sebastian and Nevada Operations units.
 
 

The map below shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and pre-development projects, as well as our corporate offices located in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, Vancouver, British Columbia, Val d'Or, Quebec and Reno, Nevada.
 

Our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the following areas:
 

• | Operating our properties safely, in an environmentally responsible manner, and cost-effectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining and investing in exploration and pre-development projects in the vicinities of seven mining districts and projects we believe to be under-explored and under-invested: our Greens Creek unit on Alaska's Admiralty Island located near Juneau; North Idaho's Silver Valley in the historic Coeur d'Alene Mining District; the silver-producing district near Durango, Mexico; the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, Canada; our newly-acquired projects in northern Nevada; the Rock Creek and Montanore projects in northwestern Montana; and the Creede district of southwestern Colorado.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimizing and improving operations at our Nevada Operations unit, which, along with other mineral interests, was obtained as a result of our acquisition of Klondex Mines Ltd. ("Klondex") in July 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to optimize and improve operations at each of our other units, which includes incurring costs for new technologies and equipment that may not result in measurable benefits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our units.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying metals price environments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance permitting of the Rock Creek and Montanore projects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining and exploration properties and companies.

See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations for a summary of our average realized and market prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.   Our results of operations are significantly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of silver, gold, lead and zinc, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Financial Risks – A substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for information on a number of the factors that can impact prices of the metals we produce. Our average realized prices for silver, zinc and lead were lower, while the average realized gold price was slightly higher, in 2018 compared to 2017. Our average realized prices were higher for all four metals in 2017 compared to 2016.  Market metal price trends are a significant factor in our operating and financial performance.  We are unable to predict fluctuations in prices for metals and have limited control over the timing of our concentrate shipments which impacts our realized prices. However, we utilize financially-settled forward contracts for the metals we produce with the objective of managing the exposure to changes in prices of those metals contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement. In addition, at times we utilize a similar program to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead (but not silver and gold) contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments.  See Note 11  of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our base and precious metal forward contract programs.

A comprehensive discussion of our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, individual operating unit performance, general corporate expenses and other significant items can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
 
Products and Segments
 
Our segments are differentiated by geographic region. We produce zinc, lead and bulk flotation concentrates at our Greens Creek unit and lead and zinc flotation concentrates at our Lucky Friday unit, each of which we sell to custom smelters and brokers on contract. The flotation concentrates produced at our Greens Creek and Lucky Friday units contain payable silver, zinc and lead, and at Greens Creek they also contain payable gold. At Greens Creek, we also produce gravity concentrate containing silver, gold and lead. Unrefined bullion (doré) is produced from the gravity concentrate by a third-party processor, and shipped to a refiner before sale of the metals to precious metal traders. We also produce unrefined gold and silver bullion bars (doré) at our Casa Berardi, San Sebastian and Nevada Operations units, which are shipped to refiners before sale of the metals to precious metals traders. Payable metals are those included in our products which we are paid for by smelters, brokers and refiners. Our segments as of December 31, 2018 included:

• | The Greens Creek unit located on Admiralty Island, near Juneau, Alaska. Greens Creek is 100% owned and has been in production since 1989, with a temporary care and maintenance period from April 1993 through July 1996.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Lucky Friday unit located in northern Idaho. Lucky Friday is 100% owned and has been a producing mine for us since 1958. As discussed below in the Employees section, unionized employees at Lucky Friday have been on strike since mid-March 2017, resulting in limited production during that time. Following a period of rehabilitation and no production at Lucky Friday in 2012, production returned to historical levels in September 2013.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Casa Berardi unit located in the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, Canada. Casa Berardi is 100% owned and was acquired on June 1, 2013 with the purchase of all issued and outstanding common shares of Aurizon. Aurizon had operated and produced from the Casa Berardi mine since late 2006 and began various mine enhancements in an effort to improve operational efficiency, including a shaft deepening project completed in 2014 and a new paste fill facility completed in 2013. In addition to ongoing production from the underground mine, production from the East Mine Crown Pillar ("EMCP") surface mine commenced in July 2016. The addition of surface production and enhancements to the processing facility resulted in increased ore throughput and gold production.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The San Sebastian unit located in the state of Durango, Mexico. San Sebastian is 100% owned, and had previously produced for us from underground mines between 2001 and 2005. Recent near-surface exploration discoveries in the vicinity of the past producing area led to the decision in the third quarter of 2015 to develop shallow open pit mines there. Production commenced from the open pits in the fourth quarter of 2015. Continued exploration resulted in the decision to develop a new underground ramp and rehabilitate the historical underground access. The underground development commenced in the first quarter of 2017, and underground ore production began in January 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Nevada Operations unit located in northern Nevada. Nevada Operations is 100% owned and was acquired on July 20, 2018 with the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Klondex. Nevada Operations consists of the Midas mine and mill, Fire Creek mine, Hollister mine, and Aurora mine and mill, along with various other exploration interests. Klondex had owned Fire Creek since 1975, Midas since 2014, and Hollister and Aurora since 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The contributions to our consolidated sales by our operating units in 2018 were 46.7% from Greens Creek, 37.1% from Casa Berardi, 8.9% from San Sebastian, 5.5% from Nevada Operations and 1.8% from Lucky Friday.
 
See the Introduction section above for information on our metals production and sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Licenses, Permits and Claims/Concessions
 
We are required to obtain various licenses and permits to operate our mines and conduct exploration and reclamation activities.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal, Market and Regulatory Risks - We are required to obtain governmental permits and other approvals in order to conduct mining operations.  Further, each of our Rock Creek and Montanore projects can only be developed if we are successful in obtaining the necessary permits. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal, Market and Regulatory Risks - Legal challenges could prevent the Rock Creek or Montanore projects from ever being developed. In addition, our operations and exploration activities at our Casa Berardi and San Sebastian units are conducted pursuant to claims or concessions granted by the host government, and otherwise are subject to claims renewal and minimum work commitment requirements, which are subject to certain political risks associated with foreign operations.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operation, Development, Exploration and Acquisition Risks - Our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks.
 
Physical Assets
 
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization and expansion of equipment and facilities and to develop new ore reserves.  At December 31, 2018, the book value of our properties, plants, equipment and mineral interests, net of accumulated depreciation, was approximately $2.5 billion.  For more information see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption.  However, such insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, and there can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operation, Development, Exploration and Acquisition Risks - Our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,714 people, including the unionized employees at Lucky Friday currently on strike, as discussed below. With the exception of the employees on strike, we believe relations with our employees are generally good.
 
Many of the employees at our Lucky Friday unit are represented by a union. The most recent collective bargaining agreement with the unionized employees expired on April 30, 2016, and on February 19, 2017, those employees voted against our contract offer. On March 13, 2017, the unionized employees went on strike, and have been on strike since that time. We cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached.
