 Item 1.  Business.
 ﻿
 We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on August 22, 1989.  We are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies and products.  We have designed and developed proprietary radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and integrated circuits for use in wireless communication products. We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and certain foreign jurisdictions.  We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore our business plan includes enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts.  
 ﻿
 We have also designed and developed a consumer distributed WiFi product line that is marketed under the brand name Milo®.  We expect to sell or otherwise exit the Milo product operations in the second quarter of 2019 and intend to focus our resources solely on licensing and enforcement of our wireless technologies.
 ﻿
 General Development of Business  
 ﻿
 During the first half of 2018, we focused on (i) production, sales and marketing, and continued developments and enhancements of our WiFi products; (ii) ongoing integrated circuit development for future products and (iii) supporting our patent enforcement and licensing efforts.  Our WiFi products did not produce the revenue growth that we had anticipated in 2018 and we also experienced lengthy delays in proceedings in certain of our patent enforcement efforts.

﻿
 In addition, trading of our common stock on the Capital Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) was suspended effective at the open of business on August 17, 2018 as a result of our failure to maintain at least $35 million in market value of listed securities. Our common stock began trading on the OTCQB, an over-the-counter market, immediately following delisting from Nasdaq and our trading symbol, “PRKR”, remained unchanged.  We intend to remain a public reporting company and we plan to continue to maintain a majority of independent members on our board of directors (“Board”) with an independent Audit Committee and to provide annual financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm and unaudited interim financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  However, the OTCQB is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq. 
 ﻿
 These factors contributed to a lack of liquidity which necessitated a change in our business plans. Accordingly, in August 2018, we implemented cost reduction measures that included a significant reduction in our workforce, the closure of our engineering design center in Lake Mary, Florida and a reduction in executive and management salaries in order to reduce our ongoing operating expenses.  As a result of these measures, we ceased ongoing chip development activities and significantly curtailed our spending for sales and marketing of our WiFi product line in order to focus our limited resources on our patent enforcement program. 
 ﻿
 From a patent enforcement standpoint, we spent much of 2018 defending our patents in validity actions filed by defendants in our patent infringement proceedings.  See “Legal Proceedings” in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a detailed description of our various patent enforcement actions.   Notably, a prior stay has been lifted in our patent infringement case against Qualcomm and HTC in the middle district of Florida as a result of an appellate court decision regarding one of the patents at issue in that case.  In addition, we are expecting a court decision shortly regarding claim construction in our patent infringement case against Apple and Qualcomm in the middle district of Florida.  We anticipate receiving trial schedules for both of these U.S. cases in the near term.  
 ﻿
 In addition, on March 15, 2019, we concluded a hearing in Germany in a patent infringement case against Apple for products that incorporate Intel chips.  We expect the court’s decision in that case in April 2019. We also filed an appeal in January 2019 of an unfavorable validity decision in Germany that impacts two German cases filed against LG and Apple for products that utilize Qualcomm chips.  
 ﻿
 A significant portion of our litigation costs are funded under a secured contingent payment arrangement with Brickell Key Investments LP (“Brickell”) and other contingent arrangements with our legal counsel.  In 2018, we received an aggregate of $4.0 million in additional proceeds from Brickell to fund our ongoing patent enforcement actions. In addition to Brickell funding, we also funded our operations in 2018 through the sale of approximately $5.3 million in equity and equity-linked securities and $1.3 million in convertible debt.  In addition, in the first quarter of 2019, we received additional net proceeds of approximately $1.3 million from the sale of additional convertible notes.   See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Item 7 for a full discussion of our litigation funding arrangements and our equity and debt financings.

 Milo WiFi Products
 Our Milo WiFi products did not generate the revenue growth that we anticipated in the first half of 2018.   Accordingly, as part of our restructuring in August 2018, we made significant reductions in our product sales, marketing, development and operations staff  as well as our expenditures for advertising and other marketing promotions, causing sales to further decline.   We expect to sell or otherwise exit our WiFi product operations in the second quarter of 2019.  
 ﻿
 Product Offerings
 Our Milo-branded WiFi product line is a cost-effective networking system that enhances WiFi connectivity by effectively distributing the WiFi signal from existing routers and modems throughout a broader coverage area, eliminating WiFi dead zones and creating a more even distribution of data rates across the coverage area.  Our product offering includes a two-unit system designed for coverage areas of up to 2,500 square feet, a three-unit system designed for coverage areas of up to 3,750 square feet, and a single-unit system, introduced in May 2018, that can be installed as a stand-alone system for smaller homes and apartments, or installed as an add-on to an existing Milo system for added coverage.  
 ﻿
 The Milo system can connect to an existing router via Ethernet cable.  Alternatively, the system can connect to the router wirelessly through our BaseLink technology thus enabling the Milo user to eliminate redundancy of coverage from an existing router while also optimizing and maximizing the overall coverage area. Our embedded SmartSeek intelligence enables the Milo system to delegate signal communication across multiple radios in each Milo unit, thereby optimizing the network path for each unique environment.  The systems are supported by mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices to enhance the overall customer experience. 
     Markets
 We marketed our Milo product line as a cost-effective product solution for inadequate WiFi coverage to consumers, small businesses and certain vertical markets, such as internet service providers.  The growing number of internet-connected devices, including smart phones, laptops, tablets, Smart Home, and Internet of Things devices such as Smart TVs, security cameras, thermostat controls, game consoles, etc., have increased the need for more robust and reliable networking solutions.  Internet connections are being upgraded through high-speed broadband technologies in order to address more complex applications and rich multimedia content.  Meanwhile, users want the convenience and flexibility of operating truly mobile devices.   As a result, the need for more convenience, broader coverage, and increased reliability of residential and small business WiFi networks is increasing demand for reliable wireless networking products.  
 ﻿
 Sales Channels
 We began selling our Milo WiFi products in the U.S. in 2017 primarily through Amazon.com and our own online store.    In 2018, we began expanding our online sales channels to include Walmart.com and NeweggBusiness.com.  In addition, we utilized consignment arrangements with a wholesale distributor to supply additional online retail channels.   During 2018, we also marketed our products and related services directly to internet service providers in the U.S. although we ceased these efforts following our August 2018 restructuring.  The Amazon.com sales channel accounted for approximately 66% and 60% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  In addition, a QVC distributor accounted for approximately 13% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Production and Supply  
 ﻿
 To mitigate supply risk, and based on anticipated revenue growth, we built up a significant Milo component and finished product inventory in 2017.  To date, our inventory has significantly exceeded the demand generated by our marketing programs.  As a result, in connection with our restructuring in August 2018, we ceased production and recognized impairment charges against our on-hand inventories.  
 ﻿
 Our components are generally purchased from third-party suppliers, including contract manufacturers, on a purchase order basis. Our components generally have multiple sources of supply; however some components are designed specifically for our products and, in some cases, require specialty tooling.  Our third-party suppliers generally purchase the materials for these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis.  Lead times for our component products are generally 60 to 90 days without incurring additional costs for expediting.  
 ﻿
 Competitive Position  
 ﻿
 We operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources.  As a result, our competitors have larger distribution channels and greater reach to customers than we do. 
 ﻿
 Our WiFi products compete with WiFi networking products offered by companies such as Google, Belkin/Linksys, D-Link, NetGear, Eero (recently purchased by Amazon), and others.  We also face competition from service providers who bundle competing networking devices with their service offering.  We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets for our networking products include product performance, ease-of-installation, price, and customer support.  
 ﻿
 Our technologies and integrated circuit products face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers, such as Broadcom, Fujitsu, Intel, MediaTek, NVidia, Qualcomm, STMicroelectronics, Marvell, Texas Instruments, and others, as well as incumbent providers of power amplifiers, including companies such as Anadigics, Qorvo, and Skyworks, among others.  Each of our competitors, however, also has the potential of becoming a licensing or product customer for our technologies.  To date, we are unaware of any competing or emerging RF technologies, other than infringing products, that provide all the simultaneous benefits that certain of our technologies enable, including highly accurate transmission and reception of RF carriers that use less power than traditional architectures and components, thereby extending battery life, reducing heat and enabling certain size, cost, performance, and packaging advantages.  
 ﻿
 We believe the most significant hurdle to the licensing and/or sale of our technologies and products is the widespread use of certain of our technologies in infringing products produced by companies with significantly greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources.  We believe we can gain adoption and/or secure licensing agreements with unauthorized current users of one or more of our technologies, and therefore compete, based on a solid and defensible patent portfolio and the advantages enabled by our unique circuit architectures.

Patents and Trademarks 
 ﻿
 We consider our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning.  We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products.  As of December 31, 2018, we had 134 U.S. and 33 foreign patents related to our RF technologies.  In addition, we have a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  We estimate the economic lives of our patents to be the shorter of fifteen years from issuance or twenty years from the earliest application date.  Our current portfolio of issued patents have expirations ranging from 2019 to 2034.  We had approximately 52 patents that expired in 2018, including certain patents that are the subject of enforcement actions.   We believe these expired patents continue to have significant economic value to us as a result of our ability to collect past damages in the event of a successful enforcement action.  
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 14 full-time and 2 part-time employees, including 7 in WiFi product development, sales and customer support, 3 in technical support for our patent enforcement and licensing programs, and 6 in executive management, finance, and administration.  We also utilize temporary or contract staff from time to time to supplement our workforce.  Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
 ﻿
